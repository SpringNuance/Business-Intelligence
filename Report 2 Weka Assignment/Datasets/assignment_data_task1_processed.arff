4,'ALWAYS PLEASANT EXPERIENCE!','I have stayed at the Edison on multiple occasions (more than 8) and have always had a good experience. Yes, the hotel is an older art-deco building, but the location and wonderful service of the staff more than makes up for the lack of extra amenities, such as room service. When I visit New York, I never even consider any other hotels. The Edison is one of the best values in the city, expecially if you want to be in Times Square.'
4,'Never a disappointment!','I stayed at the Edison in NYC from March 27-31st. Room was ready, clean and quiet. Room was booked during a special promotion so the price was exceptional. I always stay at the Edison when visiting NYC and this trip made over a dozen times I have visited. The staff is professional, courteous and always available for any questions or assistance. I had a room with 2 queen beds and the space was adequate. If you are looking for a 5-star hotel with room service and all amenities, the Edison is not for you; but if you are looking for character, charm, location and a place to be comfortable and feel welcomed, then the Edison is the one. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to truly experience Times Square and all NYC has to offer.'
5,'An Art Deco Gem','I visited Edison during a long weekend birthday trip with my daughter in the city. We showed up three hours before check-in and were quickly assigned our room. The room was spacious, well kept and had a wonderrful bathroom, with a huge deep tub. I really enjoyed the authentic vintage feel of the hotel. It is not modern, but I prefer that, The room was very quiet at night, and the beds very comfortable.\r\nThe staff was friendly, punctual, and alert, and the prices very reasonable.\r\nCafe Edison is remarkably wonderful, like wrapping the entire flavor of New York City into one room. I love the place.\r\nWe will be back in April for my wedding anniversary, I\'d definitely recommend Edison for a central Manhatten visit'
4,'Another Winning Stay At Edison','This was my second stay at Edison. We took a three day 28th anniversary trip to NYC and the Edison staff treated us so well right from the beginning. W even got a deluxe room upgrade without asking. The room was comfortable, well appointed, and roomy. It is not modern, but I love the art-deco style, and if you like that style, this is the place for you. Don\'t forget to get a meal or two at Cafe Edison, it is just the best...\r\nFor a picture gallery of our trip go here:\r\nhttp://chrisofmaine.smugmug.com/Travel/28th-Anniversary-NYC-Trip/17181864_8NfDL4'
5,'Excellent place to stay in NYC','This is my second stay at the Hotel Edison and I would recommend it highly. I love going to shows and the location is great! The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and although the bathrooms were little small, they were clean, also. We had breakfast at the Cafe there and it was excellent, too! I am planning to go back to the Hotel Edison next month and in May. Reasonable room rates.'
5,'Great location','I have stayed at the Edison at least a dozen times in the past few years. The location is fantastic! The hotel is older but the rooms I have stayed in have always been clean and comfortable. The staff have always been courteous and helpful. Planning to stay there again next month.'
4,'zu empfehlen!!','Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und einige der wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten kann man ohne Probleme zufuss erreichen: Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, Empire State Building, Macy`s,...........\r\nDas Zimmer war zwar etwas abgewohnt, aber sauber und sehr bequeme Betten - nur das Badezimmer war etwas klein, was für uns aber kein Problem war! \r\nDer Lärm hielt sich in Grenzen - alles in allem können wir das Hotel nur empfehlen!!!!! Kommen gerne wieder'
4,'Amazing location and good room','Location location location!! It\'s not the most modern of hotels but the room was clean and when we asked to change to a bigger room they were very accommodating and we were not charged extra.'
4,'Great stay','Came back one year in , this time in December. They upgraded my room to one of the new ones ( again!) and the room was big compared to new york sizes and clean. The staff are as friendly as ever and always very helpful.'
5,'Great Location','My husband and I plan a trip to New York City about 3 or 4 times a year. We love this hotel\r\nbecause it is convenient to Broadway shows and the excitement of Times Square. We have\r\nfound the staff very friendly and any little problem is taken care of within minutes. The rooms\r\nare larger than some with great maid service. We always look forward to our return stay at\r\nthe Edison Hotel.'
5,'Great Location','My husband and I visit NYC 3 or 4 times a year. We stay at the Edison Hotel because of it\'s great location and wonderful service. The newly remodeled 20th floor made our August visit\r\neven more appealing. Our corner suite was clean with a tiny but manageable bathroom. The room was quite with wonderful a/c! The housekeeping staff did a great job daily. Our bed was fresh and very comfortable. We love the charm and ambiance of the hotel.......'
3,'great location','Just returned from New York city from a girls weekend, We booked a room for 4, and was a bit concern due to the fact some of the reviews were quite negative. However to our surprise it was not everything people said. Our room was large for a new york hotel room. The room is was clean, yes it is dated with rooms that could be painted and old carpets. But who cares when you are only there to sleep and change. When you come out of the front door you are only a 2 min (tops) walk to broadway. The elevators can be slow but no biggie. The staff is friendly, and very helpful. The security by the elevators are great people to chat with for help with finding out were things are. We ate breakfast at the restaurant at the cafe in the hotel, food really good, staff not overly friendly. We also went to the Rum bar each night before we went to the play and met alot of nice people from around the world, staff their were pleasant. Only one thing to watch for the hotel has a service to the airport but charge 14 dollars or more a person and that is way to much if you are a group of four. As paying that its 56 to the airport and by taxi it is only 30-35 with a tip. The morning you leave a bell boy will flag a taxi for you. I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone I plan to go next year with our kids.'
4,'Girls stay- with the best location you could ask for','We arrived at the edison from Newark airport(cost of transportation for 4 was $68 plus tip) at lunch time on monday July 5. check in was extremly easy and they had our room ready for us on the 4 th floor. We had 4 of us sharing a room and I have to say the room was plenty big for 4 girls and our luggage. The room are dated but very clean. Our first night in our room we found that our airconditioner did not work the best, so the next morning we ask the front dest if we could have some one look at it for us and they sent someone to our room within 5 min, and replaced our airconditoner. We also booked our room on line and got the location, location special which included a wonderful breakfast each morning in the cafe just off the lobby. We found this location to be exactly what we needed for going to all locations of plays, grayline bus tours, subway and of course you can walk to alot of the sightseeing places. We found our maid was very pleasant when we chatted with her in the morning on our way out. The door man Frankie was extremly helpful to us when we wanted to go to shop in different places, he even would ask the takxi drivers what they would charge us to go to certain area\'s. He also suggested a great restaurant just down from the hotel that was excellent. We also found it nice that the hotel had a internet room and it was 1 dollar for 5 min. Like I mentioned earlier we used the grayline hop on hop off bus, we purchase the freestyle pass that gave us 72 hours on the bus all loops and it also gave us 3 attractions of our choice. The grayline office is just around the corner from the hotel so that made it easy to get our passes. . overall I would say this hotel was perfect for us girls travelling alone.'
5,'Great Hotel; Great Location; Great time in NYC','Searched the websites; found a great rate for this gem. Centrally located; 1/2 block from the new TKTS booth; 1/2 block from subway entrance. 1930\'s hotel; retains many of the charms (deco paintings in lobby; great attention to architectural detail; steam heating pipe in bathroom made for TOASTY WARM showers). Comfortable beds; two (unexpected) closets in our room; modest accommodations. All that you need when you have the excitement of NYC out your front door. I\'m sure other NYC hotels have more luxuries, but this is all you need as a base.'
5,'Still a great NYC experience','This was our second stay @ the Hotel Edison. Just 1/2 block off Times Square; the rooms are small and just the basics, but you can\'t beat the location nor the price. I felt like a 1940\'s movies star, walking the halls of the hotel. \r\nDanny\'s Deli just between the hotel & Times Square: great deli for breakfast and lunch options @ very reasonable prices for NYC. \r\nCompared to the alternatives, this can\'t be beat.'
5,'another great time there at the EDISON!!!','we were there again at the EDISON and we LOVE it there \r\nwe\'ve been to NYC 9 times from MI since 911 and we stay there every time we come \r\nits a great location and the BELL MEN are WONDERFUL \r\nwe just LOVE BOBBY AND his brother LARRY \r\nits nice to see you guys when we come \r\nhope to come back again next yr and again well STAY WIth you !!\r\nyou cant beat the location !!!\r\nsee ya again BOBBY AND LARRY \r\nbe safe guys \r\nPatti'
5,'10 TH TRIP TO NYC AND 10TH STAY AT THE EDISON!','We just got back from another stay at the Edison Hotel in NYC and AGAIN it was great! Everything was just fine, Our room was ready upon our arrival at 10 am , We dropped off our luggage and took off around Times Square, We missed Bobby and Larry this time as they were on vacation but the Edison is our favorite place , Its right in the heart of Times Square and close to everything , if anyones looking for a inexpensive place to stay go there every experience we\'ve had there has been the best , Its an older Hotel so you cant expect Taj Mahal but, as many times as we\'ve stayed there , there has been no problems with anything , I have recommended this Hotel to everyone I know that has come to NYC . One thing I did notice was , security checks EVERYONE\'S Key as you get to the elevators and that was A good feeling knowing if your not a guest your not getting up to the rooms !! \r\nStay there !! Its worth the money , you\'ll see!!!'
5,'Close to everything!','This hotel is older but it\'s a GREAT place to stay ! The door men are great ! Security checks your hotel card to get to the rooms, most of the people at rhr desk are there for you , we\'ve stayed there 11 times and won\'t go anywhere else!'
5,'Best area to stay in !','Ok.... Now I\'ve read other reviews of The Edison, but, unless you\'ve stayed there don\'t knock it! It\'s the best place to stay! Everyone was the BEST there! from the doorman at the street to the bellmen inside , you\'ll love staying there! \r\nIt\'s right in the heart of Times Square ! Walking distance to about everything in the City! Well worth the money you pay to stay In the City ! Stay there, it may be an leer place so,take that to heart ! But stay there, you\'ll be Glad you did!'
3,'Location location location','Just off Times Square, walkable to many attractions. Danny\'s deli next door but one great for breakfast - looked nothing from the outside but frequented by New Yorks finest. Reception staff efficient and helpful.\r\nRooms of a different era but you get what you pay for and basically you just need a bed for the night. Could definitely do with a makeover but that would increase the prices. Lots of good bars and restaurants within walking distance. Can recommend the Pig and Whistle. Blue Fin on the dear side.\r\nNo sign of the infamous bed bugs!'
4,'It\'s good to be back','This is the third time we\'ve stopped at the Edison and it is unbeatable for location. The bar has been renovated and has a nice atmosphere. It does cocktails but if you\'re going out for the night I would put those on hold until you return. We did not eat in the hotel this time but only because we love Danny\'s 24hour deli a few doors down. There is no need to get a cab anywhere - everything you could wish for is on the doorstep. The hotel is clean although the rooms are a bit shabby - but who cares when it\'s only a place to lay your head. \r\nWe\'ll defintely be back!'
4,'Great location, clean room, good value and friendly staff!','The Hotel Edison is a budget hotel but the rooms have everything you need for a pleasant stay; air conditioning, TV, brilliant shower and always plenty of hot water. The beds are comfortable, although there is usually only one pillow each so you might need to ask housekeeping for more, and linen and towels are changed daily. All the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful. \r\nIf you\'re looking for a comfortable place to stay with all the basic amenities, reasonably priced, and only yards from Times Square then you can\'t beat the Hotel Edison!'
5,'Still great value...','Just returned from our ninth visit to the Hotel Edison and again really enjoyed our stay. \r\nI asked for a room at the rear of the hotel (i\'m a light sleeper and find the street noise keeps me awake) and we got a room on the 14th floor at the far end and rear of the building which was very quiet, and absolutely ideal. It had been refurbished and had a new bath, flat screen TV and i think new beds with nice soft pillows!\r\nAs always we found all the staff to be friendly, and the warm welcome from the bellman who recognised us from our previous visits was very nice, and quite surprising considering the hundreds of people he must see every day!\r\nFor the first time we had booked the location package, which as well as giving a $5/night reduction on the room, also included breakfast in the Cafe Edison. There is a choice of breakfast items; pancakes, eggs/bacon and (i think) french toast. I had the 2 eggs and bacon which came with breakfast potatoes, 2 slices of toast, juice and coffee and was excellent.\r\nThe Hotel Edison is still my favourite place to stay in New York!'
5,'12th Visit…Says It All!','I’ve stayed at the Edison many times over the years but this was the first time in one of the newly renovated rooms (that’s a renovated standard room not to be confused with the new Signature rooms) and was very impressed!\r\nThe room (on the 15th floor) had been redecorated and new carpet fitted. Gone was the old TV unit to be replaced by new, modern dark wood furniture, with a matching leather headboard on the bed. Wood slat blinds replaced the curtains. The whole room looked much more modern, the bed was comfortable and of course the room was spotlessly clean.\r\nAll of the staff from the front desk, security and the maids were all friendly, and it was really nice to get a call from the Customer Relations department shortly after I checked in to check everything was okay.\r\nAs a regular visitor I have joined the Edison Excellence Program which is well worth it as you get free Wi-Fi, a voucher for a free breakfast in the Café Edison or drink in the Rum House, and discounted room upgrades. You also collect points which can be redeemed for a free night’s stay!\r\nIf you prefer a quiet room, as I do, ask for one at the rear of the building. It’s nothing to do with the hotel, but I do find 47th Street gets noisy at night and the rear of the building is much quieter.\r\nI’ve stayed at the Edison twelve times now, so it’s safe to say this is my New York home. Maybe time to check out a Signature room on my next visit!'
3,'Location, Location, Location','Have stayed in hotels from $39 to over $3,000 per night and for NYC, this one is priced where it belongs. We traveled down with a bus tour run by McCoy Bus Lines from Kingston, Ontario for the first and last time. Be prepared to trip, bodycheck or just shank your fellow passengers if you want a good seat because according to our guide the Bus line doesn\'t care and you are on your own. For the price I knew I wasn\'t staying at The Plaza and I didn\'t. I assume when the tour company squeezes them for prices they give the old unrenovated rooms to those customers. I would look forward to visiting on my own as I think the service can be very impressive under the right conditions.\r\n1) The Room: 919 - Old unrenovated. New windows. Plumbing and furnishings that were new when Hoover was in office. Sheets were clean and no signs of tiny livestock (on us or linens) older oversized closet (walk-in is a stretch) nice size however the anti-theft hanger system is a pain if you travel with your own hangers. Bathroom was the same vintage as the beautiful lobby although not as well maintained. No Bar Fridge (although, their web site says I will have to leave a credit card to use the fridge or the phone) and no WI-FI without the $9.95 per day charge. Disappointed that I couldn\'t check with home in Canada without extra charges in roaming fees, rooms phone charges or Internet access. Our view was awful however, I have no doubt there are worse views and you are staying in Manhatten so just what view do you expect for what you are paying?\r\n2) The Hotel: It\'s New Years Eve in NYC, they have one ice machine in the entire hotel (really!?) and it\'s broken. So not impressed. The lobby? it is a work of art and I so wished the rest of the hotel lived up to its promise. I know they are trying to keep up the renovation work and I know it is not easy to get everything done as quickly as people want, they could be a little more honest with their web site and show what they offer today. Not what they will offer in the future (renovated rooms) or what they offered many years ago (the views from their rooftop of Times Square which have been blocked for years).\r\n3) The Location: A 5 minute walk from times Square when we were there for New Years Eve was a huge bonus. Theatres all around, and most a very short walk, first rate for that advantage. 5 - 10 minutes down 46th takes you into Restaurant Row, choose your cuisine and price range and you will find it, many Zagat rated.\r\n4) The attached Coffee/Breakfast shop. Is a downtown city, breakfast eatery. It\'s fast, cheap and average. If you want the Waldorf go there and pay $25 for Eggs Benedict not $9.95. One warning, like much of NYC the gratuity is included so watch your tipping.\r\n5) The concierge staff: A complete waste of time, tried to recommend Midtown Cigars when I was looking for Nat Sherman, not in the same league. Couldn\'t do anything for theatre tickets other than rack prices or tell me to stand in line. Like most mid-line hotels with Concierge they are nothing but glorified information desks. Not the Concierge of past who knew everything about a city and where to get anything, and I mean anything.'
2,'Families, save yourself time and trouble','Having stayed at the Edison Hotel, Times Square during New Years Eve 2011/2012 with mixed experiences, we thought we would give them another try. Our plan was for a family trip prior to our son departing for summer flight training. Our experience began with a frustrating experience of emailing a reservations service that would sometimes take as much as 18 hours to respond and then gave only the most minimal of information requiring me to contact them again. \r\nIn response to a question concerning adjoining rooms, I was directed to look online for room availability although such information is not to be found online. \r\nOne piece of information I did secure was their lack of roll away beds or alternative sleeping arrangements for children. They do say on their web site that children under 1 year of age stay free, no mention of details for other children, and although they mention the accommodation of families in their various suites, they don\'t seem to be able to accommodate anything other than very small families only requiring limited sleeping arrangements. \r\nIn short, it seemed this hotel had little to no interest in accommodating our family during our stay. So we will explore elsewhere, and as usual offer a review of this experience.'
4,'Happy with the Edison','I was a little nervous about staying at the Edison after reading some of the reviews. I\'m pleased to say that everything was great. We arrived early in the morning, well before check in. I was planning to just leave our bags and come back when my room was ready but the front desk offered us a room right away and a free upgrade and even let us go up and check out the room before deciding. It was larger than I was expecting and was nice and clean. I\'ve travelled enough to know not to expect the Ritz and that NY hotels are pricier than most. The location was terrific if you want Times Square and the restaurant attached was very reasonable and served a good breakfast. Cash only at the restaurant though, unless you set something up with the hotel and your credit card. I only hope I\'m as pleased with the Wellington Hotel, my next stop in April/09.'
5,'The Edison Hotel New Years Eve 2011','Great, affordable, clean hotel with amazing staff. We had a wonderful time!'
4,'Best Value in Times Square!','If you\'re looking for a terrific hotel to base your theatre, shopping and sightseeing trip around this is the hotel. It if perfectly placed for Times Square and the theatre district. Everything is a short walk away. There is also a wonderful deli next door btw. It is clean, quiet and safe. My daughter and I stayed here for an eventful weekend, and we\'ll be back.'
4,'Even Better!','This was my second stay at the Edison in 3 months. My daughter and I came both times to enjoy NYC and see shows. The location can\'t be beat and there\'s a great deli next door. The hotel and rooms are very clean and we had a newly renovated room this time. The staff is friendly and very helpful. With the guidance of the concierge we tackled the subway system this trip. It turned out to be very easy. We will be back.'
5,'Boa surpresa!','Primeiramente quero afirmar que o Hotel Edison é muito bom. Podem reservar sem susto. \r\nA localização não poderia ser melhor, fica a 50 metros da Times Square, perto de tudo. O quarto que fiquei tinha sido reformado. Era limpo, sem cheiro de mofo, sem percevejos e todo dia trocaram as toalhas. Os funcionários são atenciosos e prestativos.\r\nEm resumo, antes de ir estava um pouco preocupado devido a alguns comentários colocados nos sites de reservas de hotéis (Booking, etc), mas a surpresa foi muito boa e fiquei muito satisfeito. Quando voltar a Nova York com certeza ficarei nele novamente.'
5,'Agradável surpresa!','Estava preocupado com algumas avaliações negativas mas tive uma ótima e agradável surpresa com esse hotel. Muito bem localizado, quartos limpos e funcionários atenciosos. Não tenho dúvida que voltarei a ficar nesse hotel em minha próxima ida a Nova York.'
5,'continued pleasure to stay at the Edison','just got back to Australia after 2 wonderful weeks in New York. i have been coming both professionally and privately to the Edison for over 14 years ,often 2-3 times a year and have stayed at the Edison on every occasion. i have yet to have a disappointing stay. the location is brilliant, the staff are outstanding on all levels. they are helpful when there is a problem and even though they are under extreme pressure at times, service really is with a smile and never a harsh word. From the booking staff i deal with, Ryan.Alba,Xenia and more recently Jasmine, to the reception staff, Katarina, Margaret, Toby and all the others without exception, the bell boys , Kevin, Charlie, Joseph and many other, i find the Edison a wonderful place to stay and have dealings with. i am back again in June with a group of 35 people. this is a testimony to how i believe the Edison contributes to the success 0f our trips.'
5,'this time with group','this time i had a group of 35 people from Australia on a trip with Theatrica( an Australian Company that brings groups to experience the Performing Arts of Manhattan. We stayed for 9 nights getting into the bowels of Broadway. Once again the Edison was a star. The location could not be better and the staff were extremely helpful, continually going out of their way to help our group with even the smallest problem. i have been staying at the Edison with my groups and with my family for almost 15 years and am amazed at how the new staff integrate into the Edison culture. For me it is like going home. See you next time.'
3,'Not Elegant or Trnedy, But Efficient and Comfortable','We stayed at the Edison for six nights in July 2010. I was with a group of about 20, and I had a single room.\r\nThe rooms here are good for one thing ... sleeping. Otherwise, the rooms are small and outdated. But, it worked for me, as I was out in the city during the day and very rarely in the room. The AC in my room worked very well ... almost too well. I know some of my peers had trouble with their AC units though. My room was on the third floor, and I was surprised that I had no issues with street noise.\r\nI appreciated the security at the elevators leading up to the rooms. The Cafe was excellent for breakfast. And the deli next door was very convenient, and the ice machine on the 2nd floor came in handy.\r\nThe only complaints I really have is that the bathroom was very small, and the lighting was awful. The shower was okay, but low pressure. Oh, and no free internet access. I believe it was $10 per 24-hours.\r\nOverall, I would stay here again ... in fact, i\'m planning another trip to NYC in December. All I\'m really interested in is a place to sleep ... so as long as I can accomplish that comfortably, I\'m happy.'
4,'Good place to rest & refresh','This was my second time in the past year staying at the Edison. Again, it was very economical, the service was great, & the location can\'t be beat. I was on the 7th floor, and while it was undergoing remodeling, I did not hear any noise & none of the work disturbed me.\r\nThe staff was friendly and helpful. I very much like the security at the entrance to the elevators.\r\nOverall, it is not fancy. The furniture/carpet/walls are worn, the bathroom is tiny. But it is okay for the price. I would rather spend my money on other fun things to do in NYC. :)'
4,'A lovely hotel - don\'t understand all the naysayers!!','Stayed at the Hotel Edison January 27 - 29, 2007 in room 1468. Lovely, lovely time!! From the doorman to the concierge to the housekeeping, everyone was attentive and friendly. We checked-in before 2 p.m. (listed time is 3 p.m.) and didn\'t have to say a word! Desk staff had our keys in our hands in under 5 minutes with a smile and a welcome! Hotel location couldn\'t be better - across the street from the Barrymore Theater, two blocks off hell\'s kitchen restaurants, 7 blocks from Central Park and close enough to Times Square to whistle!! Given that, the room was extremely quiet, only a few horns were heard through the open window at night - part of the NYC experience. The room itself was NOT small or tiny as some reviewers said - I\'m not sure how large you need it! I am not aware of many hotels that offer king beds (without a premium!) and our queen was comfortable. We had a shower/bath tub in a well-appointed bathroom. Past reviews and the hotel website said that hair dryers were only available upon request, but our room had one in the bathroom that worked well. Lots of towels, nice water pressure, clean tub. Room had a writing desk, satellite television, large closet and chest of drawers, two night stands. Only had to ask for extra pillows. Got a terrific price by calling the hotel ($175/night) and would stay there/recommend it anytime!!'
4,'Location, location, location - and everything else you need!','This was our third stay at the Edison in 6 years - this has to be THE BEST location of a mid-priced hotel in Manhattan. While the lights of Times Square/Broadway are literally outside your window, the hotel is quiet and traditional - the art deco lobby is spectacular! The location can\'t be beat - the Red Stairs and craziness of Times Square is outside the door, Hell\'s Kitchen restaurants and all the Broadway theaters are within walking distance, Central Park is just minutes away! Staff is courteous - make friends with Bobby the doorman and he\'ll help you throughout your stay! Rooms are standard sized for mid-town; however, ask for a double room with sofa bed and you will have plenty of room (even two closets!). Rooms are clean as a whistle, maid service prompt, beds comfortable and include extra pillows. Disappointed that the downstairs bar was closed for remodeling - it is great to have that as an alternative to Times Square madness. The Cafe Edison is perfect for a coffee in the AM, a quick meal, or carry-out to your room (pancakes at 4:00 p.m.? yes!!) or try Sophia\'s, the fine dining restaurant on the south exit. We stayed at the Edison during Marathon weekend, and you would think that the price would be sky-high, but it wasn\'t! We were able to check in before 1 p.m. (normally 3:00 p.m.) and the regular check-out time of 12:00 noon means you can finish your souvenir shopping, have breakfast and not rush! Try ;the Edison - you will not be disappointed!'
5,'We love the Edison!','I don\'t get all the bad reviews - we just stayed at the Edison for the fifth time, and I would highly recommend it! We stayed in Room 1735 - a king bed that was really comfortable, had four pillows and soft sheets. Room was very clean and comfortable, with plenty of comfortable chairs, lamps, desk and flat screen TV. Bathroom was what a bathroom is for - lots of clean towels, soap, tissue, etc. Plenty big enough to get the job done! The staff are wonderful - allowing us check-in at 12 noon with no extra fee! I love the security man - isn\'t it nice to know that not just anyone can use the elevators? Elevators very fast, hallways bright and clean. We had literally no noise from traffic or neighbors. The Edison Cafe is one of the best diners anywhere and the lobby bar is hopping on a Saturday night (we stayed until 1:30 a.m.!) Do NOT believe those who say it is terrible - stay just once and find out for yourself. Or go spend hundreds of dollars more for something else - your choice!!'
4,'Recomendo muito','A localização do hotel é a melhor possível, por um ótimo custo/beneficio....'
4,'Otimo custo beneficio!!!','O hotel tem uma ótima localização, e um bom preço.\r\nApesar de não ser um hotel novo, precisando de algumas renovações, o ponto forte é o otimo custo beneficio dele.\r\nTem tudo que interessa em sua redondeza, e ficarei novamente dele ao voltar a cidade.\r\nRecomendo muito!'
4,'Great location','Stayed 5 nights at the Edison and it was great. Rooms are small, but clean. There were 8 of us and we had 2 rooms. Staff was very friendly and the restaurant served a great, reasonably priced, breakfast. Location was terrific. Walking distance to everywhere! Would definitely stay again.'
4,'3rd stay here and will keep doing it!','This hotel is older, but very clean and secure. The location is absolutely wonderful if you are in Times Square to see Broadway shows. It is only a half block away from the discount TKTS booth for discounted theatre tickets. The hotel is walking distance to everything in Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza and 5th Ave. There is a Subway station less than a block away for everything else.'
4,'Close to Times Square','This hotel is older and is in the middle of a renovation, but the location and atmosphere of the hotel is great for New York. We\'ve stayed here several times and keep coming back, as the location is perfect for Times Square and TKTS is only a 1/2 block away. The price is awesome for the location.'
1,'Dont do it','We had one night in this flea pit prior to picking up a cruise ship. I saw the reviews before I went, and the replies from the alleged general manager in asking for a renovated room. I asked two weeks before we travelled, I didnt get a renovated room. I got room 1900. The room was filthy, paper coming off the walls, carpets filthy and curling up, the bathroom was like a tip, filthy dirty, no towels, the walls in the room itself and the bathroom had not been cleaned for an eternity. I should have listened to other reviewers. I will now try to negotiate with the company I booked the cruise with who put us in this garbage can hotel for compensation. Be really interesting in what the general manager makes of this truthful but scathing review. For your info manager, we stayed on the night of 23rd Sept 2011. A night I will never forget and one never to be repeated. I await your offer of compensation. I will not hold my breath though. Oh. Forgot to mention the fact that we had no sleep either because of the demolition going on all night across the road from our room. Anyone reading this and still books this place well, dont expect cleanliness or sleep. Just dont do it. I have warned you'
1,'Poor customer service too','I communicated with the hotel who promise via this site to look into matters. Truth is though, the hotel didnt want to know about my problem at this hotel as previously described. The travel company I booked this night of hell with in the UK, Travelbag have given me £100 compensation for the hell we suffered at the Edison. You have been warned. The hotel is poor. The customer service is poor. Never again.'
4,'great location,great staff,great city','stayed in new york three times,this was the best location.Speedy checkin.Very friendly staff.No extra charges for safe deposite box.The only problem was a hard bed,but when exhausted from all the sightseeing,I managed to sleep.Price was very good for location and the time of year.Would definately stay here again.'
5,'newly refurbished rooms.great.','The first few times I visited I used this hotel for location.However the last two visits the rooms have been refurbished and what a difference.I now will always use the hotel out of choice for location,staff,service and pleasant rooms.'
3,'Not Brilliant...needs customer service improvement','Fantastic location, rooms very dated and tacky, not like the website shows but clean enough if you are on a budget and dont want to spend too much time in the hotel. the staff were rude, they didnt have a record of our booking so i had to get proof out and due to this our group was split and we all had to share double beds not single which wasnt ideal. for the 3 days we were there every single time we went back to the room we couldnt get in, we asked reception and they sent security up with us and explained we kept getting locked out due to the room not being occupied ( they still didnt book us in) this did get annoying but when i dared to compalin i was met with glum faces and cant be bothered attitude fair point i wouldnt be back in a hurry as a smile costs nothing. but we were on a budget and didnt spend too much time there so wasnt really an issue.'
5,'Authentic Gotham deco treasure right in the midst of it all......','Want to stay in Times Square, but don\'t care for those enormous, impersonal, un-interesting modern mega-hotels? That old Gotham you\'ve been missing is alive and well at the Edison, with perfect location, abundant conveniences, friendly service, and good rates to boot. \r\nAs an art deco enthusiast, I had high hopes for staying here, as of all the Times Square Hotels, the Edison seemed not to have been renovated beyond recognition like too many others, and we were not dissapointed. \r\nWe were delighted with the quick, friendly check-in, and soothed by the elegant, yet un-assuming lobby. The murals, beautiful, original terrazo flooring, and (authentic!)maroon/green color combination made me feel right at home. Deco delights, indeed. \r\nOur room (#1029) was cozy and comfortable. Unlike other junior suites we have stayed at, this actually WAS a suite, as it had two separate rooms. Perfect for two, I caught a quick nap while my traveling companion watched the news without disturbing me. Two separate closets were a real plus, as I\'m a bit of a clothes horse, plenty of hangers too, not to mention a real, honest-to-goodness luggage stand. \r\nWe especially liked the windows on 2 sides in the bedroom, which belied its size, and brought in plenty of natural light, as well as some fresh air, often scarce commodities in hotels. The twin beds were firm, comfortable, and clean. Although small, the bathroom was well laid out, toasty warm (original radiator pipe!), amply stocked with toiletries, and again, quite clean. Plenty of hot water pressure too. \r\nNot long after checking in the phone rang, it was Customer Service asking if everything was alright. What a nice touch..... \r\nNot having had much lunch, we were starving by 5 PM, but reluctant to go out in the rain yet. Fortunately Sofia\'s was open then, and we were able to grab an early dinner before going out for the evening. Delicous Italian comfort food, fresh salad, and excellent coffee (although there was also a full bar, I was too tired for a cocktail) at affordable prices. Our waiter was friendly, amusing, and didn\'t use my lack of decisiveness to steer me towards expensive menu options. The lack of rehearsed wordy corporate script like you get at chain restaurants, was refreshing to say the least. We weren\'t there all night either, plenty of time to get back to our room, change clothes, and get to our show (most Broadway theaters are within a few blocks of here) \r\nAfter our show we took in some dancing (and terrific band) at Swing46, which left us thankful for the short walk back to the hotel (again, the perfect location), and for not having to traverse an immense lobby or long corridor to get to our room. \r\nAfter sleeping in, we noticed that the weather had turned much colder, and were reluctant to head out for breakfast. We opted for the Cafe Edison, as we had read favorable reviews. Like a diner for the theater set we also liked the ornate columns and ceilings that adorned it. What a unique setting. Don\'t change a thing! I\'ll be back to try those cheese blintzes everyone raves about. As with Sofia\'s, our waitress was friendly, charming, and made us laugh. For once, a glass of orange juice was not twice as much as I wanted. Nice hearty breakfast, terrific coffee (didn\'t have to beg for refills), and at a reasonable price. \r\nWith the separate rooms, cozy/comfortable furnishings, and real windows you could actually open, our suite felt like small deco apt. for the night as opposed to an impersonal hotel room. We were reluctant to leave so soon. Really liked it, and will definitely be back. \r\nChecking out was just as easy as checking in. Since our train didn\'t leave until 2 PM we needed to check our luggage for a while. The friendly bellman reminded me that it would be better to leave the umbrella (it had stopped raining) with him than take it/forget it somewhere. How did he know I always do that? He took good care of my antique luggage too. \r\nAfter some sheet music shopping at Colony we had a little extra time, and relaxed in the foyer (thank you for the no luggage and no food/drink sign, by the way) before heading for our train home. Elegant, but also welcoming and comfortable without ostentation. The Edison staff was consistently friendly and personable, and never obsequious. Everyone treated us like an old friend, it was so welcoming! \r\nThe only thing we didn\'t get around to was a cocktail at the highly recommended Rum House, but I\'m saving that for next time!'
5,'Second Stay as Nice as the First......','I had enjoyed staying here in January, and returned at the end of March, this time just me for an overnight getaway. The Edison is quite nice to return customers. I was greeted on arrival with a nice note from the customer service manager, coupon for breakfast, ANOTHER one for a free drink at the Rum House, and a pen/pencil set (they liked my earlier review.) Couldn\'t ask for a nicer welcome-back. \r\nHad a single room on the 17th floor. Once again, quite clean, and attractively furnished. By mid-town NYC standards, room size is about usual, not large, but well laid out to use the space and not feel cramped. Firm, comfortable queen bed, and like with the suite we had stayed in earlier, it had a nice sized closet. You can actually open the windows here and get fresh air, which isn\'t often the case in hotels. \r\nIf you\'re taking the train in the afternoon to then catch an evening show, you can\'t go wrong staying here. Most Broadway theaters are within a few blocks of here. I checked in at 5:45 (smooth, quick, and easy) and still had time to change, enjoy dinner at Sofia\'s (with nice jazz combo to boot), and get to the theater by 8 PM without running. \r\nThe elegant (yet not glitzy) art-deco lobby and public spaces are welcoming and comfortable. Really feels like New York here. You won\'t get this in ANY of the big/new Times Square hotels that are almost no different from anywhere else. \r\nThis time I finally got to the Rum House, which has been remodeled with a classy, speak-easy feel. Live piano player too. They make a real good Old-Fashioned, which are hard to come by. \r\nHadn\'t used it before, but stopped by the gift/lobby shop. Usual souvenirs but well stocked on toiletry items, etc., and anything you might have forgotten. Better than what I have seen at other hotels. Picked up a nice I (heart) NYlighter at a fairly reasonable price. \r\nAnother real New York stay at the Edison. THANKS AGAIN.'
4,'Getting old - but still GREAT location and good enough rooms','My wife and me stayed here this summer for 7 nights after crossing the US. We came by car and it was no problem to park it quick right in front to unload and check-in. A good start.\r\nI\'ve been in this Hotel already a couple of years ago. Everything still looks quite the same. The Hotel is right from the Art-Deco time.... some nice old-school feeling. Btw, you also can store your luggage for a while (when check-in or check-out) for only 50ct. a piece.\r\nLet\'s face it: Of course some parts should be renovated. And yes, the bathrooms are quite old and run-down. It is only basic equipped. But this Hotel really gets you the best value. It\'s really affordable, the rooms are big enough (I\'ve seen smaller ones in this town...it\'s NY), the staff was really friendly and helpful and the LOCATION is just almost unbeatable. It IS unbeatable if you consider what you pay for this place. And it just felt perfectly safe all the time.\r\nYou reach Times Square within seconds, it\'s literally just around the corner! And so are several subway station, which brings you anywhere in NY in a couple of minutes.\r\nWe had our room on the 22nd floor and it was really quiet up there. Didn\'t really hear anything from neighbours or from the street.\r\nIn the end we were really happy. I\'ve been in this town several times. And when we come back next time, we sure would chose the Edison again. It\'s just the best option. Even the (bath-)room is not perfect... this is New York. You only need your room for (a short) sleep anyway.\r\nWanna know more about my trips? Click on my profile or visit:\r\nroute66traveler.jimdo.com'
4,'Some check-in problems - but still a great value and location!','We spent a week here during our stay in NYC. It\'s the third time we stayed at the Edison Hotel. We pre-booked the room long ahead through our travel agent and we got a really good price. The staff was very helpful when we arrived with our car (and loads of luggage). \r\nBut then the Check-In: We did book a room for two with a queen bed. The quite unfriendly desk staff told us there\'s only a double-bed left (smaller than a queen). We argued a while but then decided to take it anyway. But then we went to our room....what a shock! It was so small, the bed did barely fit in there and was tiny. The furniture and bed looked so old and tired. And we almost couldn\'t fit our luggage in the room. We couldn\'t accept that. The other two times we were here we got much bigger rooms with a much newer interiour. So my wife went back down to the front desk and told the we will not accept this. We booked long ahead, we stayed here before, we will stay for 7 nights and will not accept this room. If not, we want our money back and stay somewhere else.\r\nAfter a few minutes the manager stepped in and....surprisingly there WAS another room available. A lot bigger room with a King-Bed ... the room was more than twice the size of the other one.\r\nAfter that our day was saved and we could enjoy our 7 nights in NYC. \r\nThe Hotel itself is dated, but the location is, for this price, unbeatable! The room was clean and actually really big (by NYC standard). The bathroom was also a quite dated, but clean enough. And even though the Hotel is so close to Times Square, we had quiet nights here and a really good sleep. We had a good week, after a pretty bad start. It\'s comfy, it\'s safe and you just really get great value here. Staff is helpful and nice (not counting the Check-In). We sure would stay again. But just be aware that room sizes and qualities do very much vary obviously. Check your room and, if you\'re unhappy, insist on getting a better one.\r\nWanna know more about my trips?

4,'The Edison is fine','We just returned from a one night stay at The Edison. Location is awesome. I had tickets to A Moon for the Misbegotten, (with Kevin Spacey), I had to walk a few doors down the street.\r\nThe room was basic, but I have paid more for less. It was clean, an absolute in my book and yes the bathroom was small, but I didnt spend much time in the room anyway. There was a little noise from the piano bar downstairs (I was on the 12th floor), but the bar closes at 1:00 and I dont think I heard any music after midnight. \r\nThe only downside was parking...not because there isnt any, there is...and they park for you, but we were staying in town until about 6:00 and in order to keep our car where it was, we would have had to pay for another full day....we chose to move it to another lot and pay there. But I would stay here again for a short term stay!'
4,'2nd time even better than the first','This was my second time staying at the Edison. I was very pleased again. Staff was super friendly & helpful. Rooms were clean, location was superb. Hot water in the shower. Only complaint and it is minor, is the hairdryer. Lucky for me, I can pull my hair into a pony tail. It was too humid to do anything else with it anyway.'
4,'Convenient location, repeat customer','We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights right before Christmas 2007. This was our third or fourth stay at the hotel, which we have adopted as out NYC base camp. It\'s convenient to Penn Station and to the areas of Manhattan we like to walk to and we accrue Hyatt points for use later. \r\nI booked the room a couple of weeks in advance via hyatt.com and got a deluxe king for $259 plus tax (about $300/night total). Our room was on the 16th floor and appeared to be fairly recently redecorated; it was the nicest room we\'ve had there and its decor reflected the hyatt website photos. The bath was small but OK, bed was very comfy. TV was in good working order. Windows opened but had view of air shaft (not a concern for us). \r\nRoom was very quiet EXCEPT that sound in the halls comes right through the door, so we\'d hear guests\' conversations late at night as they walked by. This seems to be a problem in many hotels and I\'m not sure there is much they can do about it. Overall, hotel floor was populated by quiet guests so it was not a real problem. (If you are worried ask for a room away from the elevators.)\r\nNo minibar or in-room coffeepot. (Coffee was $4 down in the lobby--usually Hyatt gives Gold Passport guests free coffee but not here, apparently.) \r\nThe workout room on the top floor was adequate, with a number of machines.\r\nEverything was clean and well maintained. Only service glitch was room service showing up at 12:19 AM -- not our order and woke us up. \r\nOverall, the Hyatt does not lavish service on you but you are taken care of with reasonable good humor and courtesy and that\'s impressive given the holiday rush and the huge size of the hotel. (Maid comes once, no turndown, but supplies are replenished and housekeeping is good.)'
4,'Convenient, newly renovated','We returned to the Grand Hyatt in late December 2011. It\'s our top choice for several reasons, most notably its convenient location. We walk there from Amtrak Penn Station in under 30 minutes; we can walk to museums and restaurants and work off some of the calories from our restuarant meals, too! :-) \r\n It is next to Grand Central Station, and the food market and wine shop there are excellent for picking up snacks or things to take home. The Hyatt has also added a 24-hour market in the lobby, with prices that seemed quite reasonable for NYC ($3 for coffee or hot chocolate). \r\nThe hotel has been re-done in current style which means brushed chrome and dark colors in the lobby. The rooms have also been re-done. Ours was smallish but adequate, with a comfortable king bed and small chaise lounge, flat panel TV, safe, empty small refrigerator. No shower cap, however, but toothpaste was provided. Go figure...guess they expect mostly men! Also no robes, so bring one if you want one. \r\nThe bed was very comfortable and the room was fairly quiet. You do hear people talking in the hallways so stay away from the elevators if you want a quiet room.\r\nHousekeeping was excellent and the employees were friendly and helpful. \r\nAll in all, not a luxurious or papmering hotel, but a perfectly fine one for a well-located midtown visit to NYC. It\'s a bit steep in terms of Hyatt points rating for what you get.'
4,'Beautiful room in good location','The rooms have just been remodeled. Toilet is very difficult to get to fully flush and new tub /shower faucet was very difficult to pull out. Double sink faucets with one long sink bow - would not have enjoyed sharing if I had been traveling with someone. Electronic light controls are odd and bedroom always seemed dark with all lights on. Cooling system worked great.\r\nI called and asked for a 1:00 p.m. early check in. Operator was rude and said there was not way they could put me on a list or try to accomodate, yet every other hotel I go to always makes an attempt to accomodate.\r\nWhen I arrived at 3, they had roooms available and the front desk clerk was courteous and helpful, so this helped offset my phone in experience. \r\nLobby remodeling is still ongoing, and some elevators are dusty and carpet is a mess in elevators.\r\nI had a corporate room rate, otherwise would have been a very high price.'
4,'Well located and good for business traveler','This is my second trip to the hotel, I was here in August of 2011 and now again in June 2012. The remodeling is now fully complete, and there has been time for dust to settle around the edges of the carpet in the room and mold to form on the shower curtain. When I was here a year ago, I had a nice size room with a large bath and double sinks. This time when traveling with my wife and 2 adult sons, I got a small room with a really small bathroom. One thing that puzzled me is why housekeeping left towels for 3 in the room each day when there were four of us in the room. They were quick though to cheerfully deliver more towels when requested.Front desk staff was friendly and accomodating, as well as the bell hops. Location is adjacent to Grand Central Station, so subway acccess is easy. Many attractions are a less than a 20 minute walk from hotel. I would definately return for a third time, but just request a larger room.'
3,'un buon albergo','negli Stati Uniti mi servo quasi sempre della catena Hyatt. Questo albergo è in una posizione ottima, molto bella la hall, un po\' più semplici le camere ma comunque di un discreto livello. Anche il bagno seppure piccolo è vivibile. Ottima, seppure costosa, la prima colazione, come non si trova in nessun albergo europeo. Personale gentile e garbato. I servizi praticamente ci sono tutti.'
1,Pessimo,'Rispetto a precedenti esperienze in questo albergo, ho riscontrato che è molto scaduto. Innanzitutto il prezzo è assolutamente sproporzionato alla qualità che offre. Lo scorso anno era in ristrutturazione con ovvi disagi, ora la ristrutturazione è terminata ma praticamente si trattava solo di un po\' di pittura e sostituzione di moquette. Al prezzo di 495,77 USD a notte non è compresa la colazione (si paga a parte carissima!), frigobar vuoto, ( 1 bottiglietta d\'acqua da mezzo litro al market nella hall 2,72 USD) no accappatoio, no ciabatte, connessione internet a pagamento, stanza mediocre visto che la ristrutturazione ha riguardato solo il cambio moquette e della carta da parati. La vecchia porta della stanza faceva fatica a chiudersi, il bagno 2 x 2 metri era minuscolo. Ascensori vecchi e molto sporchi, hall sporca con cartacce e bicchieri rotti in terra. Pulizia della stanza sufficiente. A questo aggiungiamo che ho avuto a che fare con personale villano e cafone, mi sono lamentato con un responsabile che ha fatto spallucce. È stata una pessima esperienza e non tornerò mai più in questo albergo, un tempo preferito, dal momento che a Manhattan con cifre molto inferiori si trovano alberghi migliori, più puliti, con connessione internet, e almeno dell\'acqua in camera (tra l\'altro gratis). E soprattutto personale gentile e disponibile, che all\'Hyatt è purtroppo scomparso. Mai più Hyatt, ne a NYC e nemmeno in altre città.'
1,'Nothing more than human warehousing','I stayed for two nights at the Hyatt near Grand Central Station because for some reason the rate I found was better than my usual choices, which are the NY Hampton Inns. Expecting Hyatt to be a full service, top choice, I was extremely disappointed. Other than receiving a clean room, there was nothing good about this stay.\r\nFrom check-in to check-out, the staff were at best indifferent. Half a dozen bell/valet staff stand around in front of the hotel looking bored. They watch people with bags try to get in and out of the revolving doors. They watch people walk out of the hotel and look lost. They certainly did not seem interested in helping me out when I needed directions and struggled with bags on my way in.\r\nI specifically asked the desk clerk for a non-connecting room away from the elevators, and lo and behold, I got a room with connecting doors on both sides, directly across from the elevators. I was told that that was all that was available of my room type. I heard everything that went on in both rooms: the connecting doors are not soundproof or light proof. If the room had not been so dark (very little light wattage is provided) I\'d have had to shove towels under the door to block out the light, as I did the front door. I also heard the elevator bells, but think they may have turned them off at night.\r\nDuring the second day the water to my room went off. Not sure what happened, but I did call and it was resolved. The water after was brown for a few minutes. Never an explanation or an apology. \r\nThe room was large and clean. I had room to exercise. The bathroom is small but the water pressure was good. Amenities in the bathroom were nice. There was no coffee maker in the room. Bed was new and very comfortable. Television was the old blocky kind but reception was clear and volume control worked well (to block out the noise from the televisions in the two adjacent rooms).\r\nNo reason to stay there again. Lots and lots of better and probably cheaper options in NYC.'
5,'Great location','A great location right above Grand Central station. The lady at check in was extremely nice and helpful. The room looked like it had been recently renovated and it was very nice. It wasn\'t a huge room but it was perfectly adequate. We did eat in the hotel one evening and the food was excellent.'
3,'Great location in NYC','Booked through Priceline and got a reasonable deal. Stayed here before and got a great room but unfortunately not this time. Room was clean but small and with no view and room was very dark. Suspect this was because we booked through Priceline. Checkin was slow and the lobby is under renovation. Still a good location in NYC.'
5,'The perfect pre-Christmas getaway','We arrived by train for a four day rest. The weather was harsh, but, thank goodness for the Hyatt, we just wheeled our luggage through Grand Central Station and into our hotel. We were greeted as if we were old friends at check-in. The room was comfortable and quiet. Without having to go outdoors, we had an excellent steak dinner that evening in the Station. The next day, I was able to fill in on Christmas shopping from the enchanting holiday arts and crafts festival in the Station. Of course, in the remaining days,we also went to the theatre, and the Metropolitan Museum, and returned home agreed that we\'ll do the same thing next year. The Hyatt made it all easy and pleasant--it\'s the perfect way to visit New York!'
5,'Convenience Plus','The hotel has an entrance within Grand Central Station, so for travelers arriving by train it is the perfect choice. There is also excellent valet service for those arriving by car.\r\nBesides the marvelous amenities offered by the hotel itself, you have the unmatched pleasures of the station\'s shops, restaurants, sights and sounds. To me and my family, Grand Hyatt is absolutely the perfect location for celebrations of all kinds.\r\n The hotel offers first-class service, food, and accomodations. It is the third time we\'ve been here, and we\'ve already agreed to return next December.\r\nA recent renovation turned this traditional hotel into a super-modern facility. You might wish you had an instruction booklet for turning on the lights, lowering window shades, using bathroom faucets, etc. Industrial pipe clusters hang over your head at breakfast. This is modern so sharp it bites!'
4,'Comfortable and Clean','Stayed here for a business trip during the Christmas Season, and it was lovely, though a bit pricey. Contrary to other reviews, the bathroom in my room wasn\'t tiny, it was quite spacious, updated and well appointed. The King Room didn\'t have much of a view but it had a couch, plenty of extra room and was spotless with updated fixtures and artwork Little touches, like reading lights attached to the headboard were a treat. I am looking forward to staying here again next time I\'m in the city for work. Very conveniently located on the same block as Grand Central station and within walking distance of Bryant Park.'
5,'Can\'t wait to go back','This is my 3rd stay at Grand Hyatt New York. My 1st in the newly renovated hotel. \r\nI thought the lobby was nicer as it was before the renovation. It was more warm and luxurious but now I found it more cold and business like. On check in I thought it didn\'t have the feel of a hotel more a meeting space maybe this is the look the hotel are going for. But in saying all this it is minor detail as it is still my favourite hotel in New York. \r\nCheck in was a breeze after a long flight you need an easy check in. Our room was on the 21st floor and we loved the newly renovated rooms really modern and super clean. The bathroom has a fab shower and is so relaxing afer a long day.The beds are amazingly comfortable loved climbing in every night after a long day enjoying NYC. Hotel in best location possible next to Grand Central it even has an adjoining door from the hotel to Grand Central which we never saw before on previous stays..We had breakfast most mornings in Pax a little place when you turn left at hotel and go up like 2 blocks.. Great value breakfast. There is a TGI Friday\'s 2 blocks up which is great. We are getting married in NYC next year and have the hotel booked for us and some of our guests.\r\nThe only problem we had was on check out was the queue to store our luggage. It was crazy and no need for it. There didn\'t seem to be anyone giving out the tickets and storing the luggage for minutes on end which left lots pf people just standing there in a queue far back from the lifts.Not a major deal just thought this could have been avoided.\r\nOverall I would highly reccomend this hotel and can\'t wait to go back.'
5,'Perfect for our NYC wedding','This is my 5th time staying at grand Hyatt NYC and without doubt the best! Since it was our wedding trip we came from Ireland for our july 26th wedding. The check in was fantastic really friendly and I think the receptionists name was Lsaura she made it very welcoming. We had a corner room and it gave us lots of space for all our wedding stuff. Didn\'t eat at the hotel but had drinks which was good. Rooms spotless and tastefully decorated. I think this hotel is a real manhattan experience and would recommend to everyone .'
5,'Great Hotel in Midtown','Due to Sandy and the Nor\'easter we were stranded in the Tri-State area. We had to scramble to get a room. Boy were we lucky to snag one here!! We were given a corner room that was done up very well. These rooms are very clean and decorated well. We will definitely be staying here again.'
5,'Excellent Stay','Stayed there from 11/17-11/21 and had a very good experience. I had a room on the 26th floor and the noise from the open window (a nice feature) was not bad. Fast service at check in, and very kind when I locked my key in the room! Room was small (normal for NYC) but very clean. Lobby was impressive. If you can, try and get the Club level as the breakfast (continental) was excellent. Health club was very clean and all of the equipment was very up-to-date. Will stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.'
4,'Very Good Hotel in a Great Location','Just arrived home from a five night stay in The Grand Hyatt East 42nd Street. Travelling with two family members we had one good sized room with two double beds and plenty of room to move about. Room was very clean along with the bathroom and had a large LCD tv with plenty of channels. Good sized cupboard with ironing board and iron in it. Safety deposit box in the room is a bonus. Included with your stay you have the use of the gym which has all the newest equipment, headsets and towels.\r\nThe check in was quick and reception very helpful, you also have the two other desks for info and buying tour and theatre tickets. In the main reception there is a market with hot and cold foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Tea and coffee facilities, cold drinks, alcohol and snacks which are all very reason able and handy. Also the closeness of Times Square, Grand Cental Station with the markets and dining concorse, Pershing Cafe and Anne Moore\'s round the corner.\r\nOnly bad things are the hotel Wifi. Not the speed that is the problem its that is costs $10 for 24hours use and the beds are not to everybodys comfort.'
4,'Second time and still as great','Me and the wife checked in on the 1st of the month to celebrate her birthday! As we entered, we where greeted with the new lobby decor! All black marble and new white statues, lobby looks amazing after the revamp. Fast and speedy check in and was told we where on 20th floor nxt to lifts.\r\nRooms was lovely and we had table with a seating bit at the window and big fancy lamp... Plenty of storage space for \r\nclothes And with and iron and board in cupboard.\r\nThe new bed is amazing, so comfortable and huge, me and the wife never rolled near each other all holiday!! Which please her! Room still has safety box in it which is great.\r\nMy only complaint is the wifi charge! $12.95 for 24 hours is a bit shocking! Bad it was easier to pop round the corner and get 3 dollar coffee and use there\'s for free!!\r\nAll in all this hotel is fantastic and if ever back in the city I would stay here again when back in the city'
5,'Still Great','This was my third visit to this hotel and my 14th visit to New York, I love the place.\r\nThe Grand Hyatt remains my top choice of hotel in this city due to its blend of quality and location. \r\nThe general standard of this hotel sets a general benchmark that I use when travelling. In basic terms it does the simple things well and the obvious things very well. It meets expectation.\r\nI love the fact that Cisz Henderson captured the hotel between Grand Central Station and The Chrysler Building in one of his recent paintings.\r\nTop tip - If you are travelling on a budget or simply want to experience the real New York use the subway to reach this hotel from JFK. All you need to do is use the free airport bus that collects outside the arrivals halls and takes you to the Howards Beach subway station. Then take a train to the Grand Central Station. This is right next to the hotel. Very cheap and quite entertaining as a travel option.'
5,'Can\'t get enough of this hotel','We stayed here January 2011 during our engagement trip, for four nights.\r\nLocation - On the cross cutting 42nd Street, next to the Chrysler Building and Grand Central Station. We like this location because you are far enough from the madness of Time Square, but close enough to everything to fully enjoy all that NYC has to offer. Of course, the subway is next door at Grand Central Station, but a good rule of thumb for Taxis is that everything in midtown was around $10 away with a tip included.\r\nRoom - I won\'t embarrass the staff by disclosing just how much they upgraded us, but simply say thank you and rate the room on the 32nd floor at 10/10, we were blown away.\r\nStaff - We were really looked after and can only highly praise the high quality staff at this location. In particular we would like to thank Mark Wagner for his very kind actions. 10/10\r\nFood - we did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but regularly had a light breakfast from the mini supermarket in the main reception area. The quality of the produce here was of a good standard.\r\nValue - we have always found that this hotel provides good value for money when compared against other NYC hotels of the same standard, however this years upgrade took this aspect of our holiday to 11/10.\r\nWhen we were at this hotel, the main reception was partly through a refurb, not one that spoilt our trip in any way.\r\nPlease let me finish by once again expressing our heartfelt thanks to Mark Wagner and the staff of the Grand Hyatt for an amazing experience that wholly added to our outstanding engagement trip (please feel free to view my profile for all the reviews relating to this trip).'
3,Awesome!,'Stayed in the Hyatt for five nights in July. The hotel is right beside the Grand Station which has an excellent selection of grocery and good for ATM access. We had a room facing the inside of the hotel so didn\'t suffer the noise others have described and found the room to be of a good standard. The room was modern and bright . The lobbies are n large expanses water fonts. Staff were excellent and extremely helpful.'
5,'even better!','Second time we choose to stay at the Hyatt New York and this time it\'s even better after the reform lobby and rooms. Give preference to upper floors because the view is amazing and so you can have breakfast in the hotel, service is fabulous.'
5,'A+ customer service at this fine hotel','Our family spent 7 nights here while my wife attended a conference at the hotel. This was our second stay at the Grand Hyatt NYC. No complaints about this bustling, big city hotel. Everything was to our satisfaction: comfortable and clean room (no bugs!), hot water, good climate controls, comfy beds, modern TV with a fine selection of channels, and fast elevators. We visited The Market several times each day - very nice addition since our last stay. We didn\'t use room service. We did\'t miss a coffee maker or mini-bar in our room. There were some renovations taking place, but nothing to disturb our stay. It has to be the perfect location within the city - central location next to Grand Central provides easy access to everything! The staff - front desk, concierge, management, and houskeeping - was top notch. Honestly, everyone we dealt with had a smile and a kind wordl! It\'s expensive, but a real value by NYC standards. We\'ll be back...'
5,'3rd time, still a charm!','I\'ve stayed here during my last three visits to NYC. My most recent visit was Sept, 2012 while celebrating my mothers birthday. The contemporary styled rooms and lobby turned out great. It appears all construction has been completed since my last visit in 2010. AWESOME location, great service, and a clean, comfortable room. I look forward to my next NYC trip. I\'ll be staying here again.'
5,'Grand Stay at the Grand Hyatt','I have to say that our recent stay at athe Grand Hyatt was amazing. We understood before we arrived that the lobby was under renovation so we were prepared for that...and besides, who comes to NYC to spend time in the lobby!??\r\nWe arrived very early in the day, around 10:30 a.m. We were using one of our free nights that we got from gettng a Hyatt Mastercard. We did not expect our room to be ready, but thought we would give it a try. We were met by Claudine, who was training a young man by the name of Chris. Claudine made a few phone calls and said our room would be ready shortly. To make up for any inconvenience she gave us two coupons for free breakfast the next morning (which isn\'t cheap, by any means!). They then gave us some coupons for free coffee/water/tea at the little market in the hotel. We got to talking and mentioned that we were in the City for our anniversary. Claudine made us feel like we were her best friend. Chris took time to talk to us and was so very friendly. I cannot imagine anyone complaining that the hotel staff here is impersonal! There was not one employee, from the housekeepers to the maintenance men, to men in suits and ties, to the restaurant staff, that didn\'t say hello to us and talk to us.\r\nOur room was a deluxe king which meant it had a little extra space. It was new and clean. It even smelled great. The bed was amazing. The linens were perfect. I have no complaints about the room. Yes, the bathroom is very tiny. There is no bathtub, but it was adequate for our needs. I will say that the toilet paper is a little hard to reach!\r\nThere is something that looks like a clock on the nightstand. It may be an Ipod docker, or clock radio. We couldn\'t figure it out! We couldn\'t find the time anywhere. The alarm went off in the middle of the night (to some very, very loud music). We must have it the snooze button because it went off again. Finally, I had to unplug it. It would be nice if there some instructions in the room as to how to use the thing!\r\nWhen we arried back to our room later in the evening, there was a tray with crackers, cheese and some other goodies. There was no note, but Claudine must have picked up on the fact that it was our anniversary.\r\nIt was pouring rain the day we were there and it\'s great to be able to access the hotel through Grand Central Station without having to go outside in the rain.\r\nThis was one of the best stays in the City that we have ever had and look forward to returning to the Grand Hyatt the next time we are in town.'
4,'Second Time at Grand Hyatt','My husband and I liked the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central Station so much last September when we stayed there that we booked a room a second time for a trip to The City. The renovation is now complete. The rooms are nice. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are nice. Our room came with a refrigerator, which was pretty much useless. No matter how I tried, I couldn\'t manage to make it get cold enough to chill our water. The front desk did give us coupons for coffee and water at the nice market downstairs. The bathrooms are TINY (did I say tiny?), but that\'s New York City! We never had to wait for an elevator for more than a few seconds. Due to our platinum status, we did not have to pay for internet access. We had coffee and dessert at the lounge and were very pleased with the service. You can\'t beat this hotel for the location.\r\nAt first I was put off by the personless check in, although there were agents if we wanted to wait in a line. But, it went flawlessly and even though we were a couple of hours early, we got checked in without a problem. Upon checkout we talked to a real person. I believe her name was Claudine or Claudette...however, this woman is a GEM and a huge credit to the hotel. I remembered her from our last visit and she is friendly and seemed genuinely interested in us and spent quite a bit of time talking to us. She gave us coupons for free coffee for the road and we left happy.\r\nIf you\'re looking to be treated as though you are the only person in the hotel and require a lot of attention and personal contact, this hotel is probably not for you. However, if you want a clean, nicely decorated room and all the basics in a great location, you can\'t beat this hotel.'
5,'I don\'t understand the bad reviews -- great stay!','After reading some horrible reviews of this hotel, I was somewhat nervous about staying here. Our daughter\'s school group had them booked here and we wanted to be close by, so we took a chance. We got an excellent rate of $223/night through a Hyatt promotion and were very pleased for the value we received in NYC.\r\nWe arrived at 2 pm and were allowed to check in immediately. When we checked in, we were told there were no rooms with 2 double beds available, even though that is what we requested when we made our reservations 6 month earlier. We were given a room with a king and a rollaway and a promise to move us to a room with 2 beds the following day. We had requested a high floor with a view, but when we arrived at our room on the top floor it overlooked another wall of the hotel! The front desk was very accommodating about offering us a different room, but while it had a street view it was too small to accommodate the rollaway bed, so we stayed in the much larger room with no view. Because our room was not facing the street, we heard no traffic noise, which is very unusual for midtown Manhattan! The rollaway they provided was quite nice and appeared to have a full size mattress which worked well for our teenage daughter. The room was on a short corridor, so we heard no noise from either the hallway or the street . Actually, we decided the large, quiet room with a king bed and rollaway was more comfortable than a smaller room with 2 small double beds, so we stayed in that room for the duration of our visit. After looking a a couple of other rooms, we realized that our room was exceptionally large with a walk in closet as large as the bathroom! It served nicely to both store all our luggage and be used as a private dressing room complete with full length mirror. So, if you want a large, quiet room without a view, ask for room 3428.\r\nFrom the front desk to housekeeping and maintenance, we were very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism of the hotel staff. We experienced a couple of maintenance issues (toilet that flushed too forcefully with geyser-like effect and safe not opening) that were addressed immediately and professionally. They also readily accommodated our request for a 2 pm late check out. \r\nThe lobby is beautiful and the connection to Grand Central and its food court made it very convenient. As the weather was unusually nice during our visit, we didn\'t mind walking to the theater or Times Square.'
5,'Enjoyed our Junior Suite!','We stayed here over Easter weekend, our first visit since just before the renovations began. I must say we were impressed with the improvements! The lobby, the hallways, room interiors and Grand Club were really nice. The elevators are a weak point with the carpets already worn and filthy! The hotel was completely sold out due to the holiday and a large group of Carnegie Hall performers, most of whom were staying 4 to a room, but we were able to check in quickly and even an hour before 4 pm check-in. It was evident that the hotel staff was stretched thin with the capacity occupancy as calls to the front desk and concierge were slow to be answered and often placed on hold. We were glad they offered us (as Platinum members) a late check-out as the line to store luggage (at $2/bag) stretched across the lobby on the day we checked out.\r\nOur previous stay here we were in a VIP suite on the 32nd floor. It was so spacious, I was concerned that we would be disappointed with our Junior suite this time. We were pleasantly surprised! It was at the end of the hall with a view overlooking Grand Central and all the way down 43rd St. to the Hudson. We didn\'t hear any street noise, elevator or hallway noises. I was told at check-in that this was one of their larger Junior suites, so I don\'t know how it compares to the standard. We found the living/dining area to be very spacious with two windows, an L-shaped sofa with twin sleeper hide-a-bed, a chair with ottoman (which looked more comfortable than it is), a dresser with lots of drawer space and a dining table with 4 stools. (Note: the short chair backs on the dining stools can be uncomfortable for sitting longer than a few minutes.) The wood floors, combined with the ample space, do create somewhat of an echo when speaking and walking. In addition, there was a mini-fridge and an LG LCD TV in both the living area and the bedroom. Surprisingly, neither TV offered a digital signal, so the pictures were not as good as they should have been.\r\nThe bedroom was much smaller with a third window, a Queen bed (I don\'t know that it could really accommodate a King.), another dresser with lots of drawer space and a chaise lounge. As mentioned by others, the bathroom was really tiny, but they have added shelving above and below the sink to make it more functional for storing toiletries. The shelving above the sink makes it very difficult to pull up the lever to close the drain and even harder to open it back up. If you\'re not careful, you could bang your head on the shelf when washing your face. There was a small shower with a nice rainshower type head.\r\nThe electronic shades are a nice touch, but it took us forever to discover the controls hidden behind the clock radio next to the bed. It would be nice if they offered more flexibility as it was all or nothing. All three shades were controlled uniformly and they could only be all fully open or fully closed. The living area can we somewhat dark when they are closed, but the direct bedroom view from the office building across the street necessitates them being closed if someone is changing in the bedroom. (Forget trying to change in the tiny bathroom!) Also, if one person is an early riser and wants to catch the dawn\'s early light, they can\'t do it without disturbing the sleepy-head in the bedroom. It would also be nice if the shades could be closed partway when the afternoon sun hits the living room windows. Overall, I found the lighting controls difficult to use and confusing to determine which controls which lights and the all on/off can pose problems when accidentally used by one person in one room when the other is counting on that light or darkness in the other room. The nightlight feature in the bathroom was nice.\r\nAs for the Grand Club, it was greatly improved from our previous visit, both in space, functionality and offerings. Overall, I thought the club was one of the best I\'ve seen domestically. It received a lot of traffic that weekend, but we always found a space to sit and the food was replenished quickly. It will be even nicer when the outdoor seating area opens May 1st. The Concierges were really hit or miss, with one being worthless and unable to answer any questions, and the other going above and beyond in responding to requests. The latte/cappuccino machines are some of the best I\'ve encountered for speed and variety of options. Even with the capacity crowd, there was rarely a wait. It was nice to be able to access them 24/7 along with some of the beverage refrigerators with soda and waters and the cookie jar. There is also a good selection of self-service nuts and snack mixes. Each of our three nights there, there was a different selection of both hot and cold hors d\'ouvres with veggie cups & dip being a staple. Be sure to check the refrigerator! We never saw much of a dessert selection, but later in the evening they offered some delicious little chocolate mousse bites and when they were gone there were usually still cookies in the jar. Breakfast offered a good variety with a different egg dish each day, an assortment of fresh juices, oatmeal, smoked salmon, cold breakfast meats and cheeses, bagels, pastries, fruit cups, cereal and a delicious yogurt fruit parfait.\r\nOne note for those staying in non-suite accommodations, our daughter was in a standard room and she reported virtually no drawer space. Also, for Elite members entitled to free internet, they allow you to connect all your devices for free, but we didn\'t notice until after we signed up that only the standard wi-fi is included, not the premium. The front desk willingly removed the additional charges at check-out. Also, for those complaining about the lack of a coffee pot in the room, call Housekeeping and they will bring you one!\r\nI would readily stay here next time I\'m in NYC, if the price is right. I noticed that the Guaranteed Available rate was over $600, which is outrageous. If you can get a weekend stay certificate reservation (which includes full breakfast for 2) that is a real steal!'
5,'Great choice for a luxury business hotel in Manhattan','I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in New York several times. This time I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite on the 32nd floor. I enjoyed the views, the space, my own dining room table, 2 large HD TV\'s. My bed was great and had one of the most comfortables bedding I experienced at Hyatt.\r\nThe check in service was fast and efficient. Having a lightning fast internet connection in the room is great. Like most Hyatt hotel the system does not allow to send emails using your own domain - what is a little bit of a frustration.\r\nThe location is fantastic. Public transportation to all airports is available right in front of the hotel. \r\nThe lounge was nice and breakfast was good. The gym was nice for a city hotel.\r\nOverall I can recommend the hotel for a stay in Manhattan.'
4,'Great location, good but some suggestions to make it even better','I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York several times. The new Grand Club is very nice, the breakfast selection for the complimentary continental breakfast is good.\r\nThe gym on the top floor is nice if you\'re just wanted a hick work. It would be nicer to add a jacuzzi, steam room or perhaps a pool, but this s Manhattan.\r\nI stayed t several different rooms before, but this time my room was not really designed for a business traveler. I would have loved to have a desk with a phone and convenient plugs for my computer. As with many other hotels, the Internet system does not allow to access our own server to send emails, so I had to call tech support every day to open up my IP. Tis is not a specific Hyatt problem, but a provider issue.\r\nThe staff was helpful. I would have loved to have a minibar or at least some bottled water at night, but again this is not Singapore, Dubai or London . It\'s New York and the substandard US hotels get away with these days compared to the rest of the world.\r\nOverall I enjoyed my stay, can\'t complaint about this excellent location in the center of the Big Apple'
3,'grande albergo nella media','l\'hotel è molto grande e quindi ci si sente un numero, tutto risulta piuttosto anonimo, noi avevamo prenotato una camera per tre persone ma non hanno fatto altro che portare una brandina nella camera doppia, la quale era già piuttosto piccola per due, immaginiamoci per tre! Niente a che vedere con gli hyatt dell\'Asia o dell\' Europa anche se il letto era molto comodo e l\'arredamento di buon livello. Accessori in camera ridotti al minimo, non forniscono le ciabatte, la cuffia per la doccia......\r\nLa posizione è però ottima, assolutamente centrale, si può accedere direttamente a grand central, dove si trova la metropolitana che ti porta ovunque.'
2,'servizio peggiorato ancora','sono tornata per alcune notti in questo hotel ma non ci ritornerei piū, il servizio é peggiorato, non c\'é il wi-fi gratuito,non una bottiglia d\'acqua all\'arrivo, hanno tolto anche la macchinetta per il caffé, noi l\'abbiamo richiesta, ricordando che lo scorso anno c\'era, ce l\'hanno portata ma poi i giorni successivi, non ci hanno dato le cialde per poterlo fare. Niente ciabattine, code al chek-out, servizio di deposito bagagli a pagamento,insomma anche se camere e struttura sono belle e la posizione é molto comoda, si ha l\'impressione che ci siano due livelli di trattamento molto diversi, per coloro che stanno al 16mo piano, trattamento eccellente con terrazza ecc. per tutti gli altri, che sono i più avendo l\'albergo ben 1300 camere, servizi essenziali, molto al di sotto di un quattro stelle; peccato,perché ho avuto modo di provare più volte questa catena alberghiera in oriente ed in Europa e mi sono sempre trovata molto bene.'
5,'Perfect, perfect, perfect!','I had not been in the hotel since September 2007... I came back on September 2011 for the US Open. The hotel was now remodeled, service was even better, and the rooms much more modern and comfortable! Location is great: just between Grand Central Terminal and the Chrystler Building, and in a walking distance to Times Square, the Empire State Building, and other NYC landmarks, makes the hotel just so perfect. This September I hope to go back to the US Open and find a completely remodeled Grand Hyatt NYC!'
5,'Second visit was better than first...','This is my second year in the Grand Hyatt, and I really love the hotel. What I like most about the hotel is its perfect location. It is in walking distance to Times Square, Bryant Park, just in front of the Chrysler Building, and a door connecting to Grand Central Terminal. The two times I\'ve been here, I\'ve had a full view to Lexington Avenue. The room was very clean and organized, and we got new towels every day. Lobby is now complete, and there is more sitting area and a more organized front desk. Service is exceptional, and I just can\'t forget the wonderful people that work in the hotel. Also, since I come to the US Open, the hotel offers bus transportation to the BJK Tennis Center. Hope to come back next year, or maybe sooner.'
4,'Always a good option on the East Side','This was probably my 4th or 5th stay at the Grand Hyatt New York, and as always, it was a pleasant stay. What started out as a potential problem turned into a nice benefit: Upon arrival at about 9:30 pm, I was told that there had been some staffing problems and unanticipated demand, and that my room was not yet ready for occupancy. Before I could object, the check-in clerk asked if I had eaten dinner yet, and when she learned I hadn\'t, she offered to provide me dinner at the hotel\'s expense in the hotel restaurant, and handed me a $100 hotel voucher to be used in the restaurant--or anywhere else in the hotel. I had a nice dinner and including food and wine the tab actually came to a little over $100, plus the tip, and the hotel picked up the whole tab, including the tip. After dinner, my room was ready. As always, it was a nice room--very clean, nice modern styling, comfortable bedding, and quite spacious by Manhattan standards.\r\nTo say the hotel is centrally located is an understatement--it\'s located right on top of Grand Central Station, and you can enter the station without even going outside if you want. Every sort of store, restaurant, and service you could want can be found within a block or two. Despite the location, the rooms are very quiet, even those that are on the lower floors. The sound insulation must be top-quality.\r\nPrices at the hotel are generally on the high side, but there are plenty of available discounts and deals on the hotel website, so depending on the day of the week and time of year you\'re staying, you can actually get a very nice price. Every stay I\'ve had at this hotel has been pleasant, and this one was no exception.'
4,'Still good, but not as pleasant as previous stays','The Grand Hyatt New York is pretty much my default choice of places to stay in Manhattan, and I\'ve stayed there several times and always been pleased. Having said that, my last stay there was probably my least pleasant one, and there were some glitches. First, upon arriving at about 9:00 pm on a Tuesday night, I was informed that class of the room I had booked well in advance--one with a king bed--was not available, and that I would have to take one with two double beds instead. Because double beds tend to be 6\' long and I\'m 6\'4, it isn\'t comfortable for me to sleep in a bed in which my feet hang over the edge--which is why I reserved a king--so I objected to this. The desk clerk did accomodate me, and moved some other unlucky guest\'s reservation from a king to double beds, and gave me their reservation instead.\r\nUpon arriving at my room (on one of the lowest guest room floors--the 14th, if I recall correctly), I was disappointed to see that it was much smaller than the rooms I had been given in the past (though still pretty spacious by typical Manhattan hotel standards), and that dit had only one tiny window facing the center of the hotel that was always in shadows, so even at high noon there was no natural lighting and the room was extremely dark without all the lights turned on. But worse, there was a distinct cigarette smell, despite the room being on a non-smoking floor. I went down to the front desk to notify them of this--not so much to complain as to let them know that the smell was there when I arrived so that nobody accused ME of the being the one to smoke in the room, and the desk clerk apologized and said that he could probably move me to another room the next day, but not that night. He also gave me a $60 food credit to the hotel restaurant for the inconvenience, which was nice, so I enjoyed a nice dinner.\r\nThe next morning, the smoke smell seemed to be gone, so I didn\'t ask to be moved. But when I arrived back at the room that night, the smell was back--and that was the pattern the next couple of days of my stay, too. I assume that there is a smoking floor/room directly above or below that one, and the smell seeps in at night when there\'s been enough smoking on that floor throughout the day, and dissipates overnight when people are sleeping and not smoking.\r\nOtherwise, the room was as comfortable and quiet and I have come to expect from this hotel, and as always, you can\'t beat the location and nearby amenities. Though this wasn\'t the best stay I\'ve had here, I think this was an abberration, and I won\'t hesitate to stay here again.'
5,'Outstanding Service, Great Location!','We stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York for a week on a vacation, we usually stay in the Times Square area, however this time decided on something different. Our room was not ready on arrival, however the lady at the front desk quickly took care of that and assigned us another room, she and another front desk staff who was free at the same time were both VERY friendly and welcoming, gave us maps and advised us on good times for visiting certain attractions. \r\nDuring our stay the WIFI internet broke, when I enquired about this I was offered an immediate solution and apology, I also got a follow up phone call the next day to check everything was OK by a lovely and helpful lady called Carrie I believe. The guy who checked us out was also very friendly and polite even at 5am in the morning!\r\nStandard rooms are not huge, however they are a good size as far as New York hotels go, housekeeping did a great job on all but 1 day, the renovated floors were all very clean. The shop at lobby level is great for little food items you need to grab in a hurry\r\nI loved the location of this hotel, Grand Central Terminal is right next door, the 4/5/6 Subway lines are very quick and easy to use from here to Battery Point and uptown, also a very useful crosstown bus M42 stops right outside the hotel\r\nThe renovations did not impact us at all, the lobby did get a bit busy at times but the construction workers didn\'t get in the way and you really don\'t notice much of an impact'
5,'Continues to be great!','I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York for a third time recently on vacation, this time the renovations are complete and the hotel is looking great! The reason I keep coming back here is mainly because of the staff and location... I have only ever experienced fantastic service from the staff at this hotel, everyone has always been welcoming and friendly. As mentioned in other reviews its also perfectly located above several major subway lines and an easy walk to Times Square, United Nations Building and Rockefeller Center. Also loved the new walk in robes and space for luggage in the renovated room!'
1,'Bad Service, Bad Facilities, Very Negative Impression','I am a heavy traveler stay more than 200 nights in a hotel every year around the world, of which a big contribution goes to Hyatt chain. I arrived Grand Hyatt New York on 24 January 2012 and am still here today, checking out tomorrow 29 January 2012.\r\nI did not know a 2 star hotel could be named Grand Hyatt.\r\nI choose Grand Hyatt New York because of my trust to Grand Hyatt brand and I felt betrayed. Took me, as a high ranked Hyatt Goldpassport VIP 20 minutes to line up for check-in, at 21:00 pm, which I find difficult to understand why was there so few staff at front desk.\r\nI have requested for 1 King size bed as my usual preference, and was told that was not available. But somehow magically a room because available upon request to talk to Duty Manager? The room was however at low floor that receives no sun light, I wonder how many Hyatt Goldpassport VIP was staying that had higher rank than me?\r\nThe water pressure was extremely low at shower, took twice or trice extra time to wash off soap and shampoo.\r\nThe location was good but given the fact any hotel located next to a subway station in New York would in fact share similar convinence, so can\'t really give that much credit.\r\nCharging for 1-800 numbers and while asked for an explanation what should such be charged when Hyatt is not being charged, my phone was forwarded to front duck which did not pick up and put through to a voice messsage.\r\nBarrowed an umbralla and was asked for room number and reminded to bring back otherwise will be charged for umbralla.\r\nVery bad experience, will NEVER stay at this hotel again, and advice to those of you are considering, DON\'T. And share to news to your caring ones so they don\'t have to go though this.\r\nThis is my first review at TripAdvisor, and the motivation is to help other travelers avoid bad experience.'
4,Improvement,'I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York Twice since the beginning of the year, once in January where I expierenced some unexpected experience, and filed an official complain. The second visit was however, much improved especially regarding service. While the water pressure at shower was still low, and hot water was not available for this one day, I see hotel and its managment trying its very best to make sure my stay was in comfort and that their dedication is indeed honorable.\r\nFor the amount of traveling and hotel living that I do, I am a believer that soft attention is most important factor for hotels to earn revisiting customers. Of which myself, being an extremely picky person is therefore able to recommend Grand Hyatt New York as place to stay in town.\r\nAs a side note, the hotel is only 1 minute away walk to a sports shop that sells Jeremy Lin jersey, at the time it was sold out at all major chain, to such I quote Grand Hyatt New York a good location.'
3,'A bad experience!','Twice a year I travel to NYC, and for my 2 nights trip I decided to make a reservation at the Grand Hyatt Hotel\r\nThe room was OK, good size, comfy bed but the bathroom was tiny and the shower curtain was so dark that when you were in the bathtube there was no light inside!\r\nThe first night was terrible, I could hear what was going on in the next room, and I hardly slept!\r\nThe big hall was always full of people who weren\'t hotel guest, resting and having lunch. Moreover I saw people prowling around the corridors as there was no security on the access to elevators.\r\nOverall, I think this hotel is acceptable and the location is great, but it just worth it if you get a good deal!'
4,'Very nice!','Last year I stayed at this hotel and I didn\'t feel comfortable at all (I have a review about it). But this year when my company booked again a room at the Hyatt, I could see how much this hotel had been improved with the refurbishment. My room wasn\'t too big, but was so comfy! It was nicely painted with warm colors. The bathroom size has not changed, is as tiny as it was before the refurbishment, but it has been totally renewed. The shower with sliding glass door is a hit, because old shower curtains in hotels usually get really dirty. What I missed in my bathroom were the amenities, I just had soap and toothpaste.\r\nIf you can have breakfast at the hotel, just do it! You won\'t regret! The service is very good, very polite and attentive waiters.'
5,'Great Hotel, Excellent Location','I\'ve been at the Grand Hyatt for my second time.\r\nExcellent room at the 30th Floor, very clean, excellent bed, comfortable, quiet.\r\nI also experience a suite at 33rd Floor, with two bathroom, and all you need for an excellent stay.\r\nNice Staff, and my special thanks to Jorge Lazo, who make me feel at home, a very special person who makes all to give you the best at your visit to this Hyatt.\r\nI knew Jorge at the Hyatt Regency Miami,in 1995, and now he is at NYC, and I wanna make a very special mention for his incredible touch of warm and efficient work for my reservations and all my needs at a new visit to New York City. \r\nI also have access to the Gd Club, for breakfast and Evening H. d\'Evre, excellent food, beverages , so once again Hyatt give me more than any other Hotel.\r\nThank you, hope to be back soon.'
5,'My Hotel at NYC ... GREAT !!','Once again at The Grand Hyatt NYC!!\r\nThe hotel is under a complete renovation,so i was in a brand new room, 2515.\r\nThe room was really nice, with beautiful colors , nice living area, with a very comfy sofa.All the room illumination was very modern,that works with finger touch.\r\nThe bed was really AMAZING!! comfy with cashmere wool blanket,and the mattress is like being sleeping into cotton clouds!\r\nThanks to the most efficient and kind person, the Employee of the year 2010!!!, who makes my Hyatt stays always perfect, since I knew him in 1995 THANKS JORGE LAZO!! Thanks DEAR JORGE for being always there, ready to help all of us.\r\nThanks to Diane, for her compliments , so nice and kind.\r\nIf you are planing to visit NEW YORK CITY, this is the perfect place and location, the Grand Station is beside, so you can take the metro all over NY, or simply walk, as I do, everything is around the GRAND HYATT!! Fifth Avenue, Shopping ., Restaurants, Museums, Parks!!\r\nHighly recommend this hotel and location.\r\nThanks to all the Grand Hyatt Staff, and thank you so much Jorge Lazo for taking care of my reservations.\r\nMy Hotel in New York, a perfect stay!! \r\nWill be back as soon as I can'
2,'A matter of expectations? Maybe...','Due to a longer NYC leisure stay we had to split our discount websites bids and that led us to three final nights at the Hyatt. That said, and also remembering that even discounted prices in NY are high, we were totally disappointed with this property. It is a big Vegas/convention type hotel, but lacking all the Vegas let\'s make the client happy policies. I can start by saying that they gave us a room facing a wall f other rooms windows, which made privacy an issue. The room has a good size and new nice decor, but the light and A/C system is a mess and the housekeeping is very poor for a four star, leaving things dusty, forgetting things out of place and leaving behind dirty pieces of linen on the room floor! The hotel forces you to call the room operator just to tell we want our towels to be changed daily: isnt enough to place the towels in the floor like in other hotels? I hate to be forced to save the planet, speciallly when I have payed a lot to spend little time in a hotel! Check in and check out were quick, but the stiff cold concierge has came up with a ridiculous price for a transfer to JFK, totally incredible in comparison with many other times we have used that kind of service in New York. And last but not least, the location in the East side is not so good to move around in Manhattan as it is in the west side of midtown, since the Lexington subway lines are a perpetual crowd in comparison to other subway lines. I have the feeling the Hyatt is a nice eggshell with something not so good waiting for you inside!!!'
5,'One of the best','Fantastic hotel if your staying in manhattan this is the hotel to be in, with it\'s own entrance to grand central station. All the staff are friendly and the hotel and the room could not be cleaner.'
5,'Fantastic Again','We just had our wedding in new York and stayed at the grand Hyatt because we have stayed there before and like the hotel and it\'s convenience. We were met at check in by a really nice member of staff who could not have done more for us as in putting us on a separate floor to our guests. We had a fantastic wedding day that was topped off when we came back to our room to a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries and a card from the girl who checked us in. With more memos off staff like this it would make this hotel the reason to come back.\r\nThe only part that we were not please with is when my bride was coming down the stairs she was bullied out of the way by a member of staff wheeling bags and pushed in front of my wife to be in the door she was about to walk out of and ruined a few pictures while giving dirty looks at my wife and guests. ( a picture will be provided if you want to investigate this) But I would not let one ignorant person defer you from a fantastic team and hotel.\r\nThanks for making our day that bit better.'
4,'Fantastic location great hotel','We have just returned from our trip to the Grand Hyatt, NYC. We stayed from boxing day until new years eve. We ordered breakfast the first morning which was really tasty came exactly at the time we specified and the bill was so easy to deal with upon check out, speaking of which they allowed late check out (1pm instead of 11am) for free anything further there would be a charge however I\'m unsure of how much the charge was. The hotel was cleaned everyday and we were given new toiletries & towels every day, the room was very spacious with a closet to store cases, iron and ironing board & also a combination safe which you can set yourself. There was temperature control in the room which we didn\'t actually need as the room was warm enough. We had a view of the street and grand central from our room and the window could open. There is a place to store your luggage upon check out if needed for $2 per bag - although I\'ve never had to pay for this service any where else before I would rather pay $2 than carry my suitcase around all day! There were also some plug sockets in and around the lobby waiting area to charge phone etc which came in handy for us. \r\nIf you go out the hotel doors to the right and go in the first doors to grand central station take the escalator down to the right - this will take you to the \'shuttle\' which is a subway train (there are 4) that only run directly between Times Square and Grand Central which was amazing! We paid $29 for a 7 day unlimited subway pass from which we got our monies worth! This is my 2nd time in NY and I did not use the subway system on my 1st trip as I\'m claustrophobic, however the trams are quite big and run so frequently they are rarely too packed to get on, you can get practically anywhere in manhattan in 15 min - journies which would take over an hour by any other means. We got so many things done by travelling via subway and having the shuttle next door was amazing! \r\nI can\'t fault the hotel and would \%100 go back it was clean, comfortable, contemporary decor, and brilliant location - we had a great time!'

3,'Good But Could Use Improvement','This was our 3rd time staying at the hotel, we had some problems with noise on a prior visit so made an effort to avoid that this time, mgmt seemed willing to help but the room we got was not up to par and we had to switch, the 2nd room seemed okay until we noticed how noisy the family in the room next door were, apparently they could not get two rooms with connecting doors so their kids kept running back and forth to their other room and each time the door would slam very loud, (the doors are very heavy and make a loud slam every time they close) we asked them to keep it down to no avail, so we switched again the next day, which was an inconveince since it interrupted our plans for the day but at least we got a quieter room. That room was not without flaws though as the bathroom had some chipped marble around the bath/sink and the toilet did not always flush completely. The maid on that floor was also not overly pleasant and seemed bothered when we asked for a remote for the tv as there was none in the room. Hostess in the restaurant downstairs was a bit rude when we asked to be seated for breakfest before they stopped serving. Overall, the stay was enjoyable but there is room for improvement, modern touches like the Marriotts have such as in room coffee makers and refrigerators would be nice and if a guest takes the time to make a reservation and contact the hotel about a special request well ahead of time, such as a quiet room or room with a view, it would be nice if the request was accomodated so the guest did not have to spend time resolving issues after they checked in.'
3,'Not So Grand....','I had high expectations following the recent renovation of this hotel and but was quite disappointed. I booked well in advance, requesting a quiet room with a view, I also was to be on the Grand Club floor due to an upgrade promised me after I was bumped from the hotel with very little notice due to renovations last summer. The room which was being held for me was cramped and had no view, facing an air conditioning unit. The second room had garbage piled up outside the door and looked directly into another room. The third and final room had an adequate view but noticeable damage to the closet door, a broken lamp, a nightstand which was not secured and wobbled and nearly flipped over when you opened the drawer, a blow dryer which was melted and would not work, and a tv remote which did not work, as well as a drippy facet in the bathtub and an inadequate cube like device which was an excuse for a clock radio and did not come with directions, unless you own one, you are not likely to know how to use it or set the alarm, if it even has an alarm. The hotel remodel has resulted in rooms which are noticeably smaller than prior to the remodel. The new Grand Club is a definite step down from the prior Grand Club. It is located on the 16th floor although the Grand Club floors are 16, 33 and 34, so, if you are staying on 33 or 34, you have to take the elevator down which is an inconvenience. Also, the beverages and food offered are inferior to what was offered in the old Grand Club. Tasty, but, tiny, finger sized cakes, poor quality bottled water, and piles of the same kind of cookies every day, they were tasty but maybe a little variety would be nice? The new seating areas are uncomfortable and cheap looking compared to the furnishings of the old Grand Club which was located on an upper floor and had a nice view, whose idea was it to move it 16 floors lower? Not a good idea. Staff seemed disorganized and sometimes uncaring. The new lobby is not an improvement. And, when paying 300 or 400 hundred a night, is free wi-fi too much to ask? The remodel also promised coffee makers and refrigerators, but, there was no coffee maker, had to special order one, and the front desk clerk described the refrigerator as a cooler like thing, not a refrigerator, and was correct about that. I stayed at the Andaz last year and noticed that the Grand Hyatt has copied the Andaz Check-In, meaning there are several employees with laptop stations but no actual front desk. I think the Grand Hyatt should have it\'s own identity, they seem to be trying too hard to be hip now.'
4,'Great location!','We booked this Hotel well in advance and were really fully satisfied. Very conveniently located, quiet rooms, great view from the room ;-)\r\nRoom was newly remodeled but lobby was not yet finished. Hope it is finished now.\r\nFree WIFI would be appreciated!'
4,'Graet location','Great location - great rooms on the upper levels - NO FREE WIFI :-('
5,'Top Lage, grosse Zimmer für NYC','Direkt an der Grand Central, mitten in Manhatten ist eine top Lage für NYC. Die Zimmer sind groß für New Yorker Verhältnisse und modern ausgestattet mit LCD TV, renoviertem Bad und super Heizung (war es war draußen eiskalt im Januar) so dass es im Zimmer auf Wusnch mollig warm wurde. Das FitnessCenter ist bestens ausgerüstet mit allen Geräten, Cardiogeräte haben alle einen eigenen TV eingebaut. Die Kofferlagerungsgebühr nach dem auschecken sollte man bei einem 5 Sterne Haus ggf. überdenken.'
3,'5th stay at GH NewYork, but this time it let me down','This has been our 5th visit to the Grand Hyatt New York, but this time it really disappointed us in terms of cleaniness. There are mixed critiques on the refurbished rooms, to me they appear nice, however cleaniness this time was an issue and couldn\'t be fixed by the hotel in 3 turnover attempts, despite making some noise about it. The way the management handled our compalints was professional and speaks for Hyatt, however its really surprising that the housekeeping still couldn\'t fix it.\r\nLocation wise the hotel is great as you are straight above Grand central terminal, in walking distance to Time Square and 5th Ave. The gym is cardio wise excellent equipped, however only limited muscle training machines if you care about this.\r\nThe really distorting thing the Hyatt is doing since day 1 I visited is the $2 by bag charge for luggage storage, to me probably the most annoying factor when visiting a hotel of this category. It feels like booking a biz class flight and they still charge you for checking in luggage - not sure why they do it, but as somebody rightly mentioned I wouldn\'t tip them given the politness of most of the bell boys.\r\nBTW - if you look for the coffe maker, they removed it from the rooms and it is available on request free of charge, just call housekeeping.'
5,'Un ottimo Hotel','Buongiorno a tutti volevo raccomandarvi questo splendido hotel situato sulla Grand Central di New York e per chi come noi era la prima volta in visita alla grande mela la posizione e\' davvero strategica anche perche sei a due passi dalla Fifth Avenue e 10 minuti da Times Square. Per quanto concerne il servizio direi che e\' ottimo alla reception sono molto cordiali (Ho beccato l\'unica italiana il giorno del check in) e le stanze come vedrete dalle foto sono davvero comode con divanetto letto tavolino cabina armadio e un bagno davvero eccezionale.Per quanto riguarda la colazione all\'uscita dell\'albergo trovate diverse soluzioni dallo Starbucks in Park Avenue ad Espresso un bar ad un isolato dall\'Hotel.'
5,'Ottimo come sempre','Salve a tutti eccomi di nuovo qui a commentare quest\'albergo. Ci sono stato per 4 notti per la maratona (ahime\') che poi non ho piu corso ma in compenso l\'albergo rimane sempre uno dei migliori per posizione per eleganza e soprattutto per la sua centralita\',tenendo presente che sotto si trova la Central Station punto di partenza della metro.\r\nSe vi trovate da quelle parti ve lo consiglio vivamente. Ah dimenticavo le camere, essendoci stato l\'anno scorso , le trovo sempre comode e la palestra su all\'ultimo piano e\' bellissima.\r\nBuone vacanze a New York....'
5,'The VERY best in NYC','Location, location, location plus great service. Will say in this hotel for my frquent NYC visits'
5,'Better then ever','Returned to this hotel for a long weekend and found many improvements. The front desk was efficent and helpful. Our TV had a problem, but the hotel had a staff person in our our within ten minutes to resolve the problem. The location, of course, is great. A special shout out to Mr. Leo Linton, the lobby manager, who is always available to insure your visit goes smoothly. My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several time and found it better then ever this Feb.'
4,'Nice stay. I liked this hotel','Stayed four nights at this hotel since it was adjacent to my client in NYC and they had a good corporate rate. Was given a room on the 45th floor overlooking Times Square, and while I could hear some street noise, it was much quieter than most Manhattan hotels I\'ve stayed at. \r\nThe room was large and very clean. The bed was a little too soft for my tastes, something that I do not remember from other Crowne Plaza\'s I\'ve stayed at so I wonder if the bed was more worn out than others I\'ve slept on. The linens were bright and felt very clean.\r\nThere is a great full service gym on the fifteenth floor of the hotel, which means you can work out if you want to (I think it costs $10 per day to use it though). It also means that you always stop on the fifteenth floor because the gym users are always getting on and off the elevator. The elevator programming is archaic. I\'d estimate that the elevators stop an average of six times on the way down in the morning. Very annoying.\r\nI stayed at the hotel about a week after the hotel bombings in Jordan. There were police outside the hotel most of the times I went in or out, and they required people to show a key before letting them up to the guest floor after dark, which was comforting.'
2,'From Hero to Zero in just over a year','I have stayed that the Times Square Crowne Plaza two or three times a year for about five years, and have written reviews about it before. I think this may be my last stay. I used to love the hotel, but it\'s gone down hill. \r\nI arrived earlier than the 3 PM check-in time and my room was not ready. That\'s fine: I had no expectations that it would be. But the relish with which the front desk clerk told me this, and then the joy she had telling me that we used to upgrade platinum members but we stopped was really offputting. It was as though she was waiting for the opportunity to put a frequent guest in his place by reporting that things had changed. And on her lapel she was called Front Desk Trainer. \r\nThis kind of surly, service with a snarl was fairly frequent; perhaps half the staff did their job but without any kindness. There were gems though: the woman who checked me out caught a billing error I missed, and one of the bellmen was great. But for hundreds of dollars a night I\'d expect more consistent warmth.\r\nThe room felt dirty and was not properly cleaned. The coffee maker was wet when I looked at it when I arrived, and soap was not replaced, nor trash removed, during my stay. The internet was unusable. I believe that guest usage has outstripped the hotel\'s bandwidth and it needs to be expanded. The room was musty when I arrived and just did not feel clean. \r\nWhen I checked in (after 3 PM) the woman at the front desk told me that the internet was complementary with my rate plan. But the internet was on my bill when it was slipped under my door. I did not notice this, but the clerk at the desk at check-out did: she told me that it happens all the time and she looks for it to reverse the charge, which she did. I wonder how many people just pay for the internet not realizing that is a mistaken charge.\r\nAnyway, for years I\'ve looked forward to my stays here. Now I am looking for an alternative place to stay.'
5,'Everything you want out of a hotel room in NYC.','I have stayed in NY on business a number of times and I have to say that this was my most enjoyable stay in a hotel there. No small dark cramped rooms that look out on a brick wall or where the street noise keeps you up all night. This modern hotel is convientely located in the heart of Times Sq, with great service, a decent bar / lounge area with friendly staff. The rooms are large, bright, airy, modern and clean. The bed was massive and very comfortable and the view overlooking the Hudson was a delight. I am glad I read the previous reviews on tripadvisor as it swayed my choice to stay here and now I know that on my next visit I don\'t need to look any further than the Crowne Plaza at Times Square.'
4,'A pleasant stay.','My second visit to the Crowne Plaza in Times Sq. Everything I remember it being from my first stay was still the case. Great location, good size modern room with view out to the Hudson, great facilities and staff. The bed was really comfy and I love that you can\'t hear any of the street noise during the night - a rare treat for a hotel room in NY. I have no reason to look anywhere else for my next visit as this hotel ticks all the boxes.'
4,'Great Location!','The room was spacious, clean and recently refurbished. Service was excellent! Buffet breakfast was really nice. Great location, couldn\'t have asked for anything more!'
4,'VERY GOOD, BUT........','The hotel is in a great position if you want the buzz of Times Square !The rooms are quiet, well furnished, clean and the bathrooms are a nice and well stocked! Don\'t bother with the concierge rooms, the breakfast in the concierge lounge isn\'t worth the extra dollars. The lounge is closed most of the time, there is no lock on the door when it is open, you are not asked what room you are in, anyone can walk in and help themselves to the very limited breakfast selection. There are no computers for internet use, no newspapers, basically it\'s a large dining room set out in a very basic fashion! Save your money and go to one of the many deli\'s close to the hotel. Security is very good and a couple of the staff smile! All in all a good hotel! A bit pricey compared to the Hilton but closer to Times Square!'
5,'Great stay!','In my last review, I pointed out the executive lounge wasn\'t up to scratch, well, they\'ve improved it! Great lounge, good choice at breakfast, always staffed with friendly people. Room was spotless and spacious, staff were friendly, couldn\'t do better! Free upgarde to executive floor as a platinum priority club member, didn\'t have to ask! Great five day stay!'
4,'Comfortable and great location','Stayed here for one weekend night in August after a broadway play. You can\'t beat the location and it\'s proximity to times square and broadway. The hotel was busy but efficient- smooth check in and clean well appointed room. My sisters room had a problem with the toilet and they moved her room right away. Rooms were quiet with no outside noise. \r\nCouldn\'t accommodate late check out but that\'s understandable on a busy summer tourist weekend. They were more than accommodating with our group of luggage from 5 rooms. The bell staff were great!\r\nOne side note- the toiletry products were lacking. Is always a treat to find nice brand toiletries and these were generic and drying, but there\'s a Duane Reade around the corner :)\r\nOverall a positive experience in a land of overpriced hotels!'
4,'Staff Need Training','I stay at this hotel at least once a month. I love the location and the hotel itself is fine although the bathrooms typically look as though they need a little maintenance (replacing of the caulking around the sink/tub etc.). The rooms are typically spacious and clean. My one complaint is that I prefer a room where the sink is INSIDE the bathroom. There are various configurations of room/bathroom in this hotel as in many hotels. The staff who work the check in desk seem unfamiliar with which rooms have which configuration and therefore, I often request a room with sink inside bathroom and am sent upstairs to an inappropriate room and forced to come back down and stand in line again to complain and be moved one or more times. A simple lesson in which rooms are where on each floor would solve this annoying problem. I\'ve now noted which room number will satisfy my request and will insist on this room number from now on.\r\nAlso, I highly recommended this hotel to my brother and his wife when they came to New York with us for the weekend. They ended up in a room with sink outside bathroom and in which the carpetting where it abutted the tiling of the sink area was held down with duct tape. This was embarassing for me, needless to say as I\'d touted this hotel as wonderful. I\'d also warned my brother and sister-in-law to ask for a room with shower, not tub and sink inside bathroom. They had made the request and been assured that this was the room they were getting. When they got upstairs, as has often happened to me and my husband, they were greeted with the incorrect room and theirs was also in bad shape. They were so angry but too tired to go back down. However, they vowed never to stay there again and haven\'t.'
4,'Good but Hot','While I still consider this my favorite New York Hotel, it\'s becoming too frequently uncomfortably hot in the room. I stay at this hotel around once a month now and I often find it impossible to get a comfortably cool sleeping temperature. I\'ve been told by staff that the law does not permit having both the heat and cooling systems available at the same time. I find that odd and I don\'t have time to research it.\r\nAlso, even though my own home only gets officially cleaned once every two weeks, and hotels are cleaned, presumably, between guests so one may assume they\'re cleaned more than once per week, every single room I\'ve stayed in over the past 4 years at this hotel has mold on the grout in the bathroom... (either shower or tub surround). It only takes one spray of Tilex to remove this, so what\'s the problem? it\'s not as if you\'d have to spend any time scrubbing.\r\nI like to preview the room because often the taps will not quite turn off, the water is not aerated coming from the tape and there is or is not a removable showerhead in the shower.'
4,'A year later, same problems...','I wrote a review last July entitled Staff Needs Training, in which I complained that the staff are unfamiliar with the configuration of the rooms (which rooms have a sink which is inside rather than outside the bathroom; which rooms have a shower rather than a tub, etc.). At that time, the manager replied to my review stating that my concerns were being taken seriously etc., etc. I am in the hotel as I write this. I\'ve stayed here 7 times so far this year alone and it is again July. This is my second stay this month. Again, as usual, I requested the room configuration I wanted and was sent to one which had the opposite of what I said I would prefer. The staff either a) is ignorant of the hotel configurations or b) knows which room you want but prefers to send you to one that will not make you happy. I hate to think this is the case but, seriously, you really don\'t know? Then ask someone else who does know instead of smiling, nodding and sending the guest off to be annoyed. \r\nAnyway, this is also the second time in a row when I\'ve arrived here around 1:00 in the afternoon to find the computer systems down. Even though my gold Priority Club membership entitles me to a room and key that\'s ready upon arrival and even though I know this does not and will not ever happen at the Crowne Plaza, I\'m always hopeful that at the end of a 6.5 hour drive, I\'ll actually be able to check into my room. No such luck, again. Once the computers were up, the key making machine wouldn\'t work. The person at front desk assured me he would have us in a room by 3:00 (? I should hope so since that is check in time). \r\nAt this point, my blood boiled over and I asked to speak to a manager. Ana was sent to speak to me (poor her). I gave her a piece of my mind regarding the dissatisfaction I was getting used to feeling upon check in at my otherwise favorite hotel. I complained that the check in process was not only annoying but was actually working its way toward driving me completely away from this hotel permanently. Ana was patient and a very good listener. She apologized and offered to provide us with some lovely amenities. I believe I recall being served by Ana when she was a check-in clerk and I believe a smart decision was made to promote her to management. Whereas my previous review was replied to on line but was actually completely ignored in reality, I have a confident feeling that things will actually turn around now that Ana is on the case. I got the distinct impression she actually cares what people think about this hotel and how happy and satisfied guests are with the experience, the whole experience from check in to check out.\r\nI would like to also add that, as usual, the housekeeping staff is excellent.\r\nI do recommend this hotel if you want to be near the action. The air conditioning works well, which is not the case in many nearby hotels, the concierge level service is very convenient, the restaurant is great if you don\'t feel like going out, the beds are comfortable, etc. etc. They still need to work on the check in procedure, staff training regarding the hotel itself and I think a secret guest who assesses the staff from time to time would be a good diagnostic technique they could use to find and iron out the bumpy bits. I rated the service as excellent but that was strictly Ana\'s doing.'
5,'Another great stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square','Another great stay. The room was high up (41st floor) and it was nice and quiet. As a frequent stayer with the Holiday Inn chain, I gained access to the club lounge with complimentary breakfast / afternoon tea. \r\nThe room seemed as if it had been recently refurbished. It was clean and in great condition. My only gripe would be a preference for a bath rather than a shower, but this is a minor thing and in no way would prevent me from staying in this hotel again. \r\nLocation remains great. It is a terrible shame that Virgin has left Times Square. That said, the part pedestrianizing of Broadway makes it quite pleasant outside.\r\nThe other gripe is with the swimming pool. It is a great, but I do not really wish to have a mandatory bathing hat. \r\nStaff were friendly and helpful, and I discovered the free internet access (first ten minutes are free) and this useful. The concierge was very helpful and found me a store I\'d be looking for. \r\nAs before I\'d recommend this hotel to anyone going to Manhattan for a generic holiday. It is very central with all parts reachable. You can walk down to Macy\'s in about ten minutes, and slightly less time to walk to 5th Avenue to the big stores. \r\nOne final point, there is very good security in the hotel with someone checking key by the lifts (elevators to our American cousins).'
5,'Another good stay.','Hotel was comfortable and experience was as good as the last time. I was able to secure a late check out (2pm) and was given a nice high room.\r\nThe only negative aspects to the hotel was the air con in the room did not work well. Although it was March, the room was surprisingly warm and I could not get cool air to come through the vent. However this may have been a local fault and I should have really phoned reception to sort it (It really wasn\'t that bad).\r\nThe second negative aspect was no free internet access in the business lounge. This is not good. Budget hotels including Holiday Inn Express offer this service, so not sure why the Crowne Plaza cannot. Otherwise the experience was excellent. The room had 2 double beds an immaculate bathroom with a bath and the room was a decent size on the 39th Floor. There was a large LCD TV with lots of channels that I was able to hook my portable DVD player to. Room service was reasonably priced with a wide selection of food. Location is great just to the North of the Centre of Times Square. There are 2 subway stations within 2 minutes of the hotel (49th St on the N-R Line and 50th St on the 1 Local train line). There is a large pool and gym (which I did not use). I have lost my Platinum status of Priority club (owing to not getting enough points in 2010) which meant loss of access to the top floor lounge where complimentary drinks and snacks are served.\r\nThe staff were very friendly and helpful and the bar area lively and well used. I would definetly recommend this hotel to any one who wishes to visit NYC. Location wise, you will struggle to beat this.\r\nI will definetly stay here again, and hope to get a room with a view of Times Square next time.'
5,'tolles Stadthotel','Die Lage des Hotels ist direkt am Times Square und ideal zum erkunden von Manhattan. Shows und alles in Laufnähe ebenso Restaurants und Bars. Das Hotel ist sehr elegant und modern. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer sind relativ gross für zwei Personen. Wenn die Fenster geschlossen sind hört man kaum etwas vom Strassenlärm der fast rund um die Uhr da ist.'
4,'Immernoch tolles Hotel','Tolle Lage , raus aus dem Hotel und man ist auf dem Time Square . Zimmer schön groß fü NY.\r\nAber auch nicht gerade billig. Wir finden bei 400 Dollar die Nacht stimmt das Preis - Leistungsverhältnis für uns nicht mehr. Wenn man bedenkt, daß dann noch ca. 30 Dollar fürs Frühstück pro Person dazukommen.'
5,'Would Definitely Stay Here Again','Our first trip to NYC, used trip advisor as a guide. Took the negative comments with a grain of salt....some remind me of an Aunt I have.....nothing makes her happy!!!!\r\nArrived early, guest services took out baggage and said they would deliver it to the room when it was available. Check in was quick and courteous and our room was already available. Being a Priority Club member (Platinum, not sure if levels make a difference) we were given free internet and contintental breakfast (not in the restaurant) which was more than adequate for us. Room was clean, view was out of the back of the building, which was fine by us, as when we want to sleep we prefer quite and no flashing neon signs!!!\r\nFirst night all was well, as we left the room we were greeted by maintenance who wanted to check our room as there was a water problem in the room below....not a problem....left them to their business. When we returned we couldn\'t get into our room, the maid was right there and quickly called security. Security showed up, opened the door and the bathroom was ripped apart. He asked us to pack our belonging and he returned with in 5 minutes with the keys to our new room. Everyone involed was extremely apologetic and compensated us for the inconvenience (no one needs to know what the compensation was, but suffice to say it was much more than was expected.). I would also like thank Ana at reception and Reuben from Security for looking after us so nicely. Also kudos to Hector, from guest services, a wealth of knowledge about Times Square and the surrounding area. You can count on us as returning clienst. Thanks again for making it a memorable stay.'
4,'Great location, staff and rooms.','Our second stay here. On check in was upgraded to a King corner room. 33rd floor, great view of the Hudson. Room wasn\'t ready on arrival (around noon), when we returned later in the afternoon, bags were brought to our room within 5 minutes. Room was very nicely decorated and quiet. All the staff that we encountered were always polite and helpful. Priority Club Lounge was very nice, breakfast and snacks were fantastic, again friendly staff. Great proximity to Times Square, theatres, shopping and Central Park. Look forward to returning here. Thanks for making our stay in NYC very enjoyable.'
5,'Great location, reasonably priced. We\'ll be back!','We have stayed here twice now, and will be back in summer 2011.\r\nThe hotel is clean and spaceous and rooms are well laid out. As ever, in New York, the bathroom is small, but compared to other hotels it is fine.\r\nFor theatre and night-life, there is no better location!'
5,'Consistently excellent hotel in the heart of Times Square','My third visit to the Crowne Plaza on Times Square, and it remains as good as my previous reviews.\r\nDespite its location, rooms are quiet (largely because they are a long way from the ground, spread across 46 floors). Reception was efficient, handling large numbers of people very quickly. 8 lifts make fast work of queues, although they struggle with the inevitable breakfast rush.\r\nThe bar is comfortable, but small.\r\nThe rooms are excellently appointed, with a large comfortable bed, widescreen TV, and a bathroom with proper water pressure! (a real benefit in NYC)'
5,'Great Hotel and Location','I recently stayed here for the US Open tennis tournament and had a very nice stay. Check in was very quick - no lines - room ready at 12:30pm - Rooms just had a makeover so very nice and clean, mostly all new - very comfortable bed. Linen spray nice touch - Negatives were no newspaper, tv channels terrible as no tennis was able to be seen in the room, had to go to the bar/restaurant didn\'t even have HBO. Regarding the location lots of people in TQ but if you walk a block over it is easier to get around. Breakfast was excellent, Continential came with my room and had oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, muffins, bread, cereal, cold meats, salmon, 3 types of granola, bagels - much better than the Barclay from last year. Staff was very helpful and I didn\'t feel they were cold being such a large hotel. I would definately stay here again.'
5,'Another Great Stay at the Crowne Plaza','My second time staying here for the US Open tournament and just excellent. I was thrilled to have an even bigger room than last time, hard to get in NYC ! The room was wonderful, had a Keurig coffee maker, Large LG Digital TV, the bathroom was huge..someone could have stayed in there it was so big! , the whole room was great size for 4 people. The room was also very clean as well. I arrived later in the afternoon and my room was ready however last year I was there before 3pm and got in the room right away. I guess it depends on how quick people check out. I really like this hotel, location is great and you can walk over a block and get away from TQ if you don\'t want all those crowds. I also had no problem with noise sleeping at all. Please also see my review on my blog as well: \r\nhttp://nycstylecannoli.blogspot.com/2010/10/crown-plaza-times-square-hotel.html'
5,'OMG, THE best hotel on Times Square!','We have been to New York 4 times and have stayed in 3 different places. This hotel has to simply be the best. We stayed on the 40th floor and our room overlooked Times Square, amazing view, breathtaking! The cleanliness of the room was award winning. We experienced our safe not working and housekeeping had an engineer decked out in full boot and suit within minutes, the security manager, also an extremely charming immaculate gent was involved and profusly apologised for the inconvenience, i almost apoligised back they were so nice. A blocked toilet experienced at 5am (that darn time difference thingy), housekeeping had a fantastic chap there in minutes, truely amazing, all cleaned up and fresh towels straight away. \r\nThe front desk were brilliant, the theming is so plush. We didnt sample the food or bar but looked expensive but thats okay! The hotel is a minute from Times Square, minute from the subway, taxi\'s cost less than 10 bucks to both the corner of 5th and central park and the empire state building. Overall if you are looking for a fantastic experience please please please book the Crowne Plaza truely the best New York experience!'
5,'Second visit, excellent as always','Our second visit to the fabulous crowne plaza times square. Fabulous view from a city view room. The service was excellent and the location at times square is hard to beat. Definitely recommend and will definitely return.'
5,'Excelente localização','maravilhoso hotel,perfeitamente localizado no centro de tudo,serviço excelente,quartos bons e modernos,otimo restaurante não precisa utilizar taxi praticamente e possivel caminhar a todos lugares saboreando nyc,voltarei a esse hotel no final do ano devido a excelente experiencia que tive lá.'
5,'continua otimo','essa foi minha segunda vez neste otimo hotel recomendo a todos e uma otimo opçao para quem quer ficar bem localizado em nyc gasta-se muito pouco em taxi e ha otimas opçoes de comida por perto,o hotel e muito bom conta com piscina coberta raro em nyc,estrutura fantastica,e serviços impecaveis melhor opção em nyc'
5,'The only place to stay in the Times Square area!','I have stayed here many times over the past several years.\r\nSuper-friendly front desk!\r\nThey aim to please.\r\nEspecially nice to Platinum Priority Club members with unadvertised breakfast buffet and free internet access.\r\nWith all of this, and their location, it\'s the only place to book your stay!'
5,'Once again, everything was SUPER!','Great location, friendly staff, nice dining and lounge. clean and well appointed rooms.'
5,Phenomenal,'Amazing hotel with a terrific location. The staff was extraordinary. They were friendly, welcoming, and very knowledgeable. This will be my hotel of choice in times square forever. Leo is the Guest Service Manager and I have never known anyone with greater customer service skills than him. He was delightful to talk to and he really takes great care of the guests at his hotel.'
5,Phenomenal,'I will always stay at the Crowne Plaza whenever I travel anywhere. I travel most often to New York and the level of service that is provided by their employees is extraordinary. Yes, the hotel is conveniently located on Broadway in Times Square. Yes, the rooms are magnificent with terrific views and are so very clen and have the comfiest beds. Yes, the food in the restaurant is terrific, and the mixologists at the bar sure do know what they are doing, but overall it\'s the people that make this hotel a great place to stay. Sandra Esp. At the reservation desk was so pleasant and we chatted for a bit and got to know one another. She was so down to earth. Jason, the mixologists was spectacular and his drinks were magnificent. This is the only hotel that when we sit in their bar area, we could do so for hours because it is so darn comfortable. Georgio Paraponiaris was also very personable and his level of customer service should be mirrored by others. For me, there is no other hotel. The Crowne Plaza is the place to be and I highly recommend it to all. If you don\'t want to, you never have to leave the hotel, because everything you need is in the hotel. Thank you so much Crowne Plaza for hiring amazing staff members to represent your magnificent hotel.\r\nThank You, \r\nMichelle Maiter\r\nChicago, Illinois'
5,'Amazing location with great service,staff,food, and value!.','The customer service I received was EXCELLENT. It started with the general manager; Mr.Gerry Hughes who made it a point that my accomendations were perfect. I was there on business/pleasue and had to entertain some business associates. I host a radio show in Orlando; ESPN 1080 on Thursdays from 1-3 p.m . and told my listeners that The Crowne Plaza hotel Mtimes square is the place to stay if you want the true New York Times Square experience. I make it a point that when I come to New York I stay there. The housekeeping and cleanliness of the rooms are always excellent and the staff is always polite and friendly . The food from room service is one of the best I have had at a resonable cost so I don\'t feel that I have to eat out because I know i\'ll have a great meal. The front desk ia also professional and accomendating as well as the bar. In this time of economic stress it is refreshing to feel that I am getting great service for a good value. Thanks for making my stay wonderful again, I look forward to returning. sincerely,Dr.Carl D. Bilancione'
5,'Dr. B','The service is always excellent from your arrival to the bar(Keith-excellent bar tender). The checkin process is quick and the staff very accomodating.Gerry Hughes, who is the manager, has his pulse on the staff and it is evident by the quality of the service. The rooms are ALWAYS clean and the chamber maids extremely friendly. The location of this hotel and the value, in my opinion is the best value in NYC.\r\nSecurity, is evident so my family ALWAYS feels safe at this hotel. No question,when I have to visit NYC I stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square.'
4,'Location, Location, Location','location is everything about this Hotel, but also it\'s clean, modern and friendly staff. I stopped in nY for 24hrs on my way home and this hotel fitted the bill perfectly. Will be going back in Novemebr with family and have already booked again.\r\nit\'s big and busy so if you like personal service forget it, but if central location and cleanliness is your thing then this is spot on. Rooms were recently refurbished and surprisingly big for central NY.'
4,'Great Hotel, Great Staff','This is the second time I have stayed at the CP Times Square, this tIme I was with my wife and parents. As a Platinum member of Priority Club I expect certain perks, but to have those extended to my paretns room I thought was exceptional.\r\nThe staff do anything to help, always have a smile on their face and are a pleasure to talk to.\r\nThe location goes without saying, you can\'t get better.\r\nIf I was to pick a fault, it would be the bar, I wish it was more like a bar rather than an addition to the lobby.'
3,'Second-rate staff!','I was excited to spend three days at the Crowne Plaza Times Square as a birthday treat. Even more happy to be able to use the rewards that I earned as a Platinum Elite member of the Priority Club. When I checked into the Crowne Plaza Times Square, I was hoping to be upgraded to a nice room. What I did not expect was a room on a lower floor that overlooked a roof full of noisy motors and fans!! When I requested another room, I was told that, those rooms are reserved for people who pay! I was able to change rooms to the other side of the hotel, however the person at the reception desk seemed annoyed and bothered by my request.\r\nWith few exceptions the staff seemed indifferent and lacking basic customer service skills. However, the concierge was wonderful and the woman who cleaned my room was very pleasant.\r\nBut it was the demeanor of the late afternoon bartender in the lounge on December 15 that was the most offensive. Although the bar did not seem that busy, I was ignored for at least 15 minutes. When I finally got the attention of the bartender to try and place my order, he looked me in the eye and mustered up his most arrogant attitude and said, When I finish setting up for my drinks, you will be next.\r\nI was determined not to allow a second-rate staff spoil my holiday. However, there is no excuse for rude service, especially from a hotel that claims to be first-rate!'
5,'Improving More Each Year','This is my third stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square and the hotel keeps getting better. The location is great, the rooms are large with very good bathrooms and the staff, this time around, was very pleasant and helpful. A very good stay.'
5,'Short Stay','Fourth or fifth stay at this hote. Just one night this time. Room was great on the 42nd floor with a beautiful view. Staff very friendly and very helpful.\r\nLooking forward to a longer visit next month.'
3,'Would have been good if I\'d got room we paid for!','Stayed here for 3 nights which I\'d booked back in Nov 09, booked a double double concierge room. When we arrived I was asked to come back after 5pm as the room wasn\'t ready as the hotel had been extra busy dealing with stranded passengers (due to the flight cancellations beacuse of the volcano) wasn\'t overly bothered as we are off to Intrepid anyway so left cases and came back at 6pm. Had to wait in line again to check-in which took around 20mins, finally got to room on 44th floor only to find we\'d been given a king room. With 2 adults and a 13yr old this wasn\'t what I expected, went back to reception only to be told that the hotel was full and that a king room was big enough for 3, or I could take a rollaway. Spoke to the Mgr who basically said take it or leave it I asked if I could have a reduction for the rollaway and was told that both rooms were the same price. By now it was 7pm I was tired and hungry, so I accepted the rollaway, when the bed came the staff left it at the door so my husband had to wheel it in and assemble it, we then had to share our bedding out as they hadn\'t left any more. The rollaway made the room look cramped and as the bed was next to the window we couldn\'t stand near the window for a view of Times Sq. \r\nHad we had the room I paid for I would have been quite happy as the hotel was lovely and clean. The food and snacks on the 46th concierge floor were very good and we had an adequate breakfast every morning. Very annoyed at the dismissive attitude of the Mgr and also found the Concierge on the ground floor to be very rude and unhelpful. Finally, when we found ourselves stranded on the Monday we were due to leave the hotel wanted to charge an additional $100 per night for us to keep the room, we turned this offer down.'
1,'Stay Somewhere Else - Terrible Experience!','Our rooms were on the 42th floor and had a great view. However, the room felt like a hot house the entire time. I called about the heat 3 times, over a 3 day period. They said they couldn\'t adjust the heat nor did they offer to move us to another room. Finally on the 3rd day and insisting to speak to the Manager I was offered a $30 coupon that was good for the breakfast area or the bar. It was a $500+ per night room and I my family had two rooms. That\'s over $1,000 per night. At that point I was greatly offended and refused the $30 coupon offer. The only way to lower the heat was to open up the window, put a rolled up magazine in it to keep it open, open the room door, prop it open with a trash can to create a cross ventilation. I actually pulled the blow dryer out in the hallway to dry my hair so I wouldn\'t feel like I was dying of heat stroke.\r\nTrying to sleep at night in the heat was miserable.\r\nThe Breakfast buffet is grossly overpriced. 4 people with a 15\% tip was $153. We paid about that much for dinner at very nice restaurants.\r\nDue to renovations, the only way into the hotel is though the back.\r\nI will not return to this hotel. There are several hotels in this area that are FAR BETTER.'
1,'Very Dissapionted. Choose Another Hotel.','Run Away! Very disappointed. Poor Value.\r\nFor $369 a night I expect alot more than what I am getting. The air conditioner doesn\'t work, so we finally got a fan brought up to our room. The price for coffee and food is outrageous. Room is shabby.. And I don\'t mean shabby chic. The wall paper is falling down in the bathroom and it reveals a huge hole when the plumbing is located. \r\nOn top of paying $$$ for a standard double room, they charge almost $20 per day for Internet. I did manage to get a code for Internet only to have it not work. I finally got another one, but had to try several times before it would connect. \r\nI would not recommend this hotel.'
5,'Great Place...great value....great location!','This is the second time I\'ve stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square. Once in 2005, and just recently in September of 2009. They have renovated the rooms since 2005, and they are just great!! Quite spacious for NY...This hotel is so conveniently located...and the staff is very attentive and informative. Don\'t miss the bar overlooking Broadway...great place to end your day. I\'ll be back in NYC next year, and already know this is where we will stay.'
5,'Continues to be a great place!','This hotel is situated right in the middle of the theatre district. It\'s a great place to stay because it\'s so convenient both for walking, and riding the subway. The staff are attentive, helpful,, and friendly.\r\nThe room is nicely furnished, we had a great view of the town, the amenities are just what we needed. For that area of town, I believe our room was at least as large, if not larger than most other hotels. \r\nWe did have an issue with an odor in our closet, but they changed our room the next morning, which was as quick as they could do so. (I didn\'t want them to spray anything in the room to just mask the odor, thus the room change was necessary). \r\nThis was my third time in this hotel, and I\'ll definitely stay there again.'
5,'Super Lage!!!!','Verbrachten den Jahreswechsel 09/10 im Marriott Marquis.......\r\nFreundliches Personal, sauber und gepflegte Zimmer und die Lage einfach unbezahlbar!!!'
5,'Tolle Lage','Wunderbares Hotel direkt am Times Square. Das ideale Hotel wenn man stressfrei Sylvester geniessen will!\r\nAber auch für alle anderen Aktivitäten ist es ideal, weil alles leicht zu erreichen ist! Das Hotel ist sehr sauber und die Mitarbeiter extrem freundlich und hilfsbereit!!Der Preis ist ok-günstiger ist imner besser.... :-)\r\nKomme gerne wieder!!'
5,'Perfect Location, Heavenly Bed','We took a last minute trip to NYC and stayed at the Marriott Marquis because my sister raves about it. I think the location is perfect! \r\nThe sushi bar was fabulous and the drinks at the Broadway Lounge was perfect at the end of the day.\r\nWe had Sunday brunch at the View which was lovely and delicious but way too pricey to do again. This would be perfect in the evening to see all of the lights of the city as the restaurant is on the 43rd floor and rotates.\r\nWe were delayed at the Lincoln Tunnel so had to cancel our dinner plans but the conceirge reccommended a nice Italian place Trattatoria Dolo Posto Treatre (Sp?) which had unbelievably great Italian food.\r\nI was dissappointed regarding the lack of a pool but the room was very clean and the bedding was exceptionally comfortable. There were plenty of treadmills available and they are the ones with individual TV\'s.\r\nThe only downside is when it happens to be busy the elevator\'s get crazy. It took forever to go up to the eighth floor get our bags and then go down to the 1st floor for our car. Also, on Sunday afternoon there was always a line at the conceirge and if you called you were put on hold indefinately. I just had one question about a location that would have taken 2 seconds to answer but I couldn\'t wait any longer.\r\nParking is pricey ($50 a day) but I don\'t know of any options. I would definately stay here again.'
4,'Fun Hotel in the Center of Midtown','This is a great place to stay for your first trip to NYC. It is busy, busy, busy, busy. I do NOT reccomend the hotel for breakfast. It is super expensive and just average. There is a bagel place around the corner where you can do much better. The elevators are a lot of fun for the kids. This place is thier favorite place to stay. We opted to pay for an upgrade to a Times Square room and it was worth it to us to do so, however, if you aren\'t planning on staying in the room much, I wouldn\'t bother. The concierge desk is constantly busy so to wait in line if you need something. There are always plenty of taxi\'s available.'
5,'Perfect stay, will go again. Loved this hotel! Elevators worked flawlessly','I am very fussy and this hotel was just perfect in every way. The staff was very, very pleasant. The room was big and beds were comfy. Bathroom was big with granite counter, nice flat-screen TV in room. The heat/AC system worked well. The air quality in the room was excellent. Elevators worked flawlessly. I don\'t know what others mean about the elevators. I think they did not know how to use them, it\'s very easy. Just punch in your floor number and watch the pad for which elevator to go to for that floor. We got an elevator immediately every time with no problem. \r\n I have no complaints at all about the hotel. Will go again and stay here. I was very comfortable here. Location is excellent. Valet parking was a breeze. Room was very soundproof. Went for a drink at The View on 48th floor and it rotates with NYC view, very awesome! (The only negative I could find is that there is a charge for internet service (even in public areas) but we did not use it.)'
5,'Great hotel with great location in Times Square','This was my third time staying at the Marriot Marquis and I love this hotel. Rooms are clean. Beds are comfortable. Air is good. The heating/ac system worked very well and I could be very comfortable in the room (I am very fussy about that) with very good air.\r\nFront desk, concierge, chambermaid, valet parking desk were all extremely welcoming and friendly. Had a side view of Times Square. Rooms are a quiet oasis. Hard to believe if you haven\'t been there but it\'s true. No bedbugs either. We will be back as I tried another hotel last summer and I prefer this location and hotel.\r\nWe highly recommend the View restaurant at the top of the Marriott Marquis. Amazing view. Had the dessert buffet with chocolate fountain. Our waitress was top notch. Very friendly and professional.\r\nThe only bad thing was a very surly, grumpy busboy at the View restaurant. He actually yelled at us twice on Sat. night (2/11/12) around midnight because he did not want us seated on that side of the restaurant. Go to other side he yelled twice and told us to see the host again as we went to our table. Not a very good welcome to the restaurant. He was actually yelling this out loud at us after the host had seated us there and directing us back to the host with flailing arms. \r\nI will not lower my five stars because of this totally unprofessional, out-of-line and rude busboy though. Hope management will read this. We thought he was our waiter yelling at us and were shocked to find out later that he was just a busboy yelling at us. Very strange especially since the waitress and everyone else was very nice. Great experience overall though. We did not let this spoil our evening and definitely recommend the hotel and the View.'
5,'As usual, FANTASTIC STAY!','We\'ve stayed at the Marriott Marquis for our annual XMAS trips back to NY to visit family for the past three years. This was the best as we were upgraded to a Times Square view on the 41st floor even though I\'ve shrunk to silver status at Marriott. We checked in on Dec 22 and were originally scheduled for 4 nights and paid a great rate months ago with the prepay option which is why I rated it as excellent for value. Normal great service as we checked out a day early due to the coming snow storm and even though prepaid, the elite team on the 8th floor (faridah) did a great job of ensuring we got credited to our credit card for one night. Room service was fantastic as usual. We dont eat there as we have so many favorites close by due to the fantastic location. Great having starbucks on the 8th floor! Will stay here each and every time and the location is our favorite. Only slight draw back can be the unique elevator system and during busy times you need some patience.'
5,'Back Again','Our annual holiday time trip to NYC and stay at the Marquis. As has always been the case, a fantastic stay. From the valet of the car to check-in, all a fabulous, smooth, efficient process. II\'m only silver status now at marriott which helps at check-in with their own line which happened to be shorter. Staff was great and gave us a great room with view of Times Square. Love the location as we do multiple Broadway shows and dinner in the area. Nice to be able to walk around midtown and be able to quickly get back to the hotel as a base to travel with easy access to subways, etc. We didn\'t eat here so can\'t comment on food other than the Starbucks for muffins and coffee on the 8th floor which is very convenient.'
4,'Excellent location, very good stay!','We stayed on the 41st floor (4119) which was recently renovated (entire floor) and it showed. Very surprised at the large size of the double bed room! This hotel is massive at nearly 2000 rooms, the level of service, personal interaction was surprisingly good. The location of Times Square is key but be prepared for a lot of energy at all times of day and night. We did not experience much noise from the street but I would imagine the lower floors might be a factor. We had a great view of the square from our room too. While here, try Juniors for cheesecake right across the street and Johns Pizza and 44th street (a 2 minute walk) Elevator system was great but expect some wait (not too much) at peak times. The lounge on the 8th floor had good appetizers and was a great place for nightcaps!'
5,'2nd stay, as good as the first','My family of 4 ( 2 kids ages 11 and 9) stayed here last year around the same time and had a great stay then and now. This is a massive hotel (some 1700+ rooms) in the heart of Times Square. Near subway lines, a short walk to Penn Station, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Highline Park... You get the picture! Well run with efficient, kind staff, I cannot think of a better palace to stay in NYC when you factor in price, location, quality. They have a large, clean fitness center, a restaurant / lounge at the top that rotates around so you can see the city lights at night while having an adult beverage. Several additional lounges and restaurant on the 8th floor. A Starbucks on the ground floor and another coffee shop (serve Starbucks coffee too)/gift store/mini store for items you might have forgotten. Right accross the street is Juniors Cheesecake and johns pizza on 44th street (really good thin crust, coal-fired pizza in an old church )- don\'t miss either! If you have a smartphone, download the NYC subway app (mxapps). Used this app a bunch to navigate the sometimes confusing subway system and it was very helpful. Get a Times Square view room... The lights are so bright at night you need to close the curtains otherwise its too bright to sleep! Too cool...'
4,'Elevators and views all worked for me','I had a good stay recently at the Marriott Marquis.\r\nAs many people who have stayed at the Marriott Marquis can attest, the elevators might, on any given stay, have the potential to infuriate and frustrate you. With the lobby eight stories up and the rooms far beyond that, it is an elevator-dependent situation. When they are all running and arriving on time, it is fun, with a glass elevator and lots of out-of-towners drinking in the sights on the ride. The revamped elevator assignment system lured me back after I vowed years ago never to stay there again because of insane waits and crowding. Last few times, though, it has worked as well as most elevators in large buildings in NY. The wait from your floor still seems long sometimes, but it often is in skyscrapers. So I am satisfied that it is going to stay reasonably convenient. This does not mean you may not have to wait, or that the crowds might feel a bit oppressive; that ground level area is still a bit grim but worlds better than a decade ago.\r\nI don’t love the decorative metal screening they had to put up to keep people from landing in the atrium many stories below, although I appreciate why they had to do it. It was nicer and more open before, of course, but they made a significant effort to make it look like something other than what it is. Safety and minimizing tragedy come first although it reduces the interior view considerably.\r\nMy room looked toward downtown, over Times Square. If you get a Times Square view it might also look uptown, toward the Park. Downtown Times Square is my preferred view, and in my room it was all about huge windows, clean glass, and the focus was on the outside. It was great fun to work on my computer and watch the show outside. I could see if the Toys R Us was not jammed and run over for a quick Lego to take home with me. Also could watch TV being made, and at night, plenty of action outside. You don’t have to go out into the cold to feel like you are connected in some way to the hustle and bustle. It was comfortable and the Internet was quick.\r\nMy room was a good size for a NY hotel room and the bathroom was well-maintained and fully functional. Clean is what I care about most and mine was in good shape. At this time of year there are room bargains to be had, and mine was a decent value so that was not an issue.\r\nIf you are in town for a play the location is perfect, of course. The hotel has its own theater in it, and most others are in about a five block array around the hotel. The area is packed with restaurants, too, so you need not take all your meals at the hotel. A five minute walk in any direction can bring you deli, healthy, BBQ, chocolate, Asian, Italian, bodega, fine dining, fast food, and virtually anything else you might crave.\r\nThe walls are not perfectly soundproofed, and I did have a noisy neighbor but it was not terrible. I was just about to ask to have it toned down when the noise stopped, so maybe someone on the other side of that room asked first.\r\nFor a gigantic hotel the staff is busy and preoccupied. They have to be to handle this volume, although reception was friendly and efficient. I had to wait a few too many minutes to get to the desk; they eventually brought out additional staff to minimize the wait and everything went smoothly after that.\r\nI have visited with my children, who love this hotel. From the elevators, to the views, to the proximity to great food and shows, it is a go-to place if the kids are with me. We try to stay when we are seeing a play or if I have work in midtown. The views are great, something the nearby hotels (I stay in those in midtown, too) nearby really don’t have in abundance.\r\nSo, the Marriott Marquis is a bit of an experience. A little dramatic with the elevators, a decent, normal room with the potential for dramatic views if you get the right room (ask), and a few of the pains of daily coming and going in a huge place in a crowded city. I will be back, I am sure.'
3,'Nice, but pricy','This hotel is in a prime location in the middle of time square. The rooms are nice, and the staff friendly. It was very quiet and convenient. Very expensive, but understandable for the location.'
4,'Great location but very busy','We stayed here 4 years ago. Same great location, and they\'ve renovated some rooms. On check in as Marriott elite, it was very fast with a truly separate line for elites (3 check-ins as a matter of fact!) I was there on points, and got a nice room. The main problem with this hotel is the vast number of people. There about 15 elevators, but they are often slow and jam-packed on the weekends. My main problem was the group of very loud and obnoxious drunk girls in the room next door. Had to call security 3 times: 2AM, 3AM, 4AM. Got moved to another room the next night, which was much more quiet! I\'d return again.'
5,'anniversary weekend','hands down the best hotel in new york city. besides the waldorf astoria. great location and great view!'
5,'labor day weekend','hands down once again love this hotel the staff, and the location room was actually free because i am marriott reward visa card holder, i will always stay here no matter if i had to pay. bed is very comfortable, excellent channel line-up on the tv and i love the times square view room love, love , love this hotel'
5,'No apologies - it\'s the best!!','I\'ve read the reviews - most are favourable; some not so, For us, our second time in two years, it\'s the best. We love the Marriott Marquis, mainly because its feeling of sheer space. What other hotel can boast an area like the eighth floor - reception, restaurants, bars, shops, concierge, theatre booking desk, American Express, desk Starbucks and stil have plenty of space to walk round. The rooms are spacious and the staff helpful and friendly. Its situation could not be better - right in the midst of Times Square. We have travelled all over the world, stayed in hostels and five star hotels but the Marriott Marquis remains our favourite.'
5,'We shall return!','We stayed at the Marriott over the 4th July weekend; it was crowded with every room taken on the Friday night. And yet once you closed the room door you heard - absolutely nothing, a tribute to the designers. The crowds obviously had an effect especially with the lifts and waiting times caused some annoyance. But that wasa minor blip. Of more concern was the closure of the bar overlooking Broadway due to renovations. We survived in the Atrium bar but it just wasn\'t the same. This hotel has everything you need on one floor - the eighth. It also has light and spacious rooms This was our fourth stay at this hotel and we shall certainly return.'
4,'Good Location - OK Room - impersonal','I have posted a review earlier of Marriot Mayflower Washington DC, which where the hotel we stayed at just before we camne to Marrriot Marquis in NYC. What a difference, this hotel here in NYC is big - very big. \r\nAsked for two rooms one with 2 beds and one with one bed. The hotel gave us connecting rooms which were very nice even though we did not ask for it. The rooms were big when you consider this is a NYC hotel. The room are well equipped !\r\nAlways when we go to NYC we choose Times Square Hotels, since locations is simply that good - but of course it costs - So bring money.\r\nWe would probaly go back to this hotel on a later occasion.\r\nOn all hotels we visit a Gym, Coffe Maker in the rooms, TV, Telephone arte considered a commidity - But WIFI (internet) is always charged in US - It is also a commidity. Me as a dane now most even experiences that Scandinavian hotels have internet included why ?'
4,'We are back','We stayed at this hotel in 2010 for our fall vaction. We find the location fantastic – and we feel that Times Square is the place to be (and stay). We have tried many different hoteks in the Times Square disctrict, howver we have returned to Marriot Marquis, since this proves to be the best.\r\nWe opted for Times Square View rooms which are 579 USD per night. The rooms are weel equipped and spacious and the look very good.\r\nThe hotel is huge ! However there are some serious drawbacks like:\r\n1)\r\nThe Hotel charges for internet in the room 16,95 per night. We find that WIFI is just as much a commodity as a phone or a TV in room and should be a service, that ANY hotelier would understand is mandatory to make your professional guests feel at home.\r\n2)\r\nOn would think that when you have paid a quite high price for the room you could also require some service – but do not expect too much. I bought 10 postcards the gift shop in order to get stamps the hotel more or less DOUBLES the stam price in the giftshop. Pay or go away – I find generally find that a hotel in the range quality and price could have at least some services that are not charged highly.\r\nWe enjoyed our stay !'
4,'Great hotel. Few issues probably won\'t bug you','I\'ve stayed for a long time at this hotel. I\'ve been there in 2004 for around three weeks, and stayed again in 2007 for roughly the same time.\r\nThe location is probably the best in NYC. Right on Times Square, and if you like to walk like myself you can probably reach any Manhattan point by foot, which is a pretty nice way to see the city inmy opinion.\r\nRooms were also very good. I took a few classes in NY and everytime I got back to the hotel I felt really comfortable. You have al that nice common stuff like pay per view movies, cable, safe, nice shower, and even a coffee maker. It is very spacious and some views are great.\r\nThe Internet service is very fast, and easy to use. I used it with cables, so I can\'t comment on the wi-fi. Great bed, good workdesk, and overall a very spacious room, especially for NYC. My room was way bigger than in the other Marriott I stayed in the city once. The name escapes me now (sorry everybody) but it is a very nice hotel close to Times Square too. \r\nThe gym seems like something from the future. There are flat screen Tvs so you can walk while listening to TV. You have a view of Times Square from there, and lots of equipment. Some were a little unusual to me since I\'m more used to just lifting free weights, but it was a nice experience, and 24/7 if I recall correctly.\r\nCleanliness was OK. My first service complain is actually about the housekeeping services. I\'ve spend a lot of time studying and I didn\'t make much of a mess in the room, so I was fine with having a lot of timw without housekeeping and the privacy to let my things wherever I wanted them with not much concern. They would call me because they have some policy of having to clean rooms from time to time. It makes some sense (they can check that I\'m no terrorist or suicidal guy I guess), but it was bothersome and, when they came, the cleaning wasn\'t really great. They behind left a bunch of empty soda battles that I had stored on the airmoire (is that the right word?) besides the TV since the trash can was small.\r\nThe Internet was great as I said, except when it failed. If had a connection problem, and I had to make several calls to some center oustide of the hotel (probably outside of US) and then get a guy to fix it, which didn\'t work. They ended up changing my room after a lot of trouble. At least they gave me a better view, so that was cool.\r\nThe room service is nice if you\'re not standing there for much time, or if you sleep at night (it works only until 2 am or something). Not many health options though. My main complain is that they got it wrong more than once. I would ask for a egg white omelet and I\'d get a very yellow omelet that was definitely not make of egg whites. The people who delivered the food were all extremely nice. One even managed to remember me from a single brief talk in 2007 (I was istening to a Brazil-Argentina soccer game n the radio and he remembered it). Outstanding!\r\nThe breakfast in the hotel restaurant (there\'s ony one for breakfast) may be the best I\'ve ever had. Friendly staff, and if you choose the buffet you\'d had lots of variety with any kind of eggs or pancakes, oatmeal, some kinds of fruit, cereal, bagels, and as much oragne juice and coffee as you want. Loved it.\r\nThe gift shop was very resourceful and, even if you don\'t want to buy anything from it, you\'re right at Times Square, so it\'s hard to feel helpless for anything. It\'s hard to find a conventional supermarket I guess, but that\'s a Manhattan thing. The gift shop attendants were also very nice.\r\nThere are two Starbucks IN the building. One at the lobby (8th floor) and the more assorted one is more shared with outsiders at ground level.\r\nI haven\'t had drinks, sushi and what not, but the lobby has a nice Times Square view and a few eating options.\r\nIt isn\'t hard to order pizzas, sandwiches or any kind of meal from the hotel, but you have to go down to the ground level to meet the delivery guy there. I really didn\'t mind, so that was OK to me.\r\nI guess I can also say that NY is NOT the city that never sleeps. I\'m from Sao Paulo in Brazil and I feel that Sao Paulo gives me more options at night. If you want to eat really late at night, you\'re out of luck, unless you want to wander the streets looking for some place. That won\'t affect any people though.\r\nThere is also no minibar, so my advice is to ask for a fridge. They will provide a small fridge in the room for 25 bucks (you payjust once for the whole stay) , and it was enough for me to keep plenty of sodas and yogurt.\r\nThat\'s about what I can tell you. I emphasized some issues, but I had just a few in like 6 weeks during my 2 stays there. So, overall, you\'ll probaby be very happy with this hotel. Works for business, leisure, study, whatever you need. \r\nPS: They also were able to deliver to me stuff that I bought on-line, even when the arrival was before my check in date (I noticed them, of course).'
4,Update,'I\'ve been here in 2004, 2007 and now 2012. You can click on my name to read my old review. \r\nI\'ll just update it a little:\r\nBetter:\r\n- Elevator system seems better now. Still a little crowded, but less than before\r\n- The convenience store on the lobby is also improved - now you have more options for eating, including healthier choices\r\n- You can buy Broadway tickets in the lobby now. More expensive than TKTS for sure, but easier and faster.\r\n- The design of the rooms felt a little smarter too.\r\n- Internet now has (paid) wi-fi, but that\'s a given nowadays. It doesn\'t work that well, but it was very bad in 2007 so I guess that\'s an improvement.\r\nWorse:\r\n- Marriott reservation system seems to be getting worse. I lost count of how many times I contacted them to make sure they knew I was paying for a whole day to be sure I would get a room in the morning (so I paid for the night before). Yet, they cancelled my reservation (as I understand, they charge me but I can\'t use the room).\r\n The front desk guy didn\'t apologize or anything. Just told me it was cancelled and, after some insistence on my part, he finally found some rooms for us. \r\n- The place where we put the soap in to take a shower had residual soap in there. \r\nI concentrated on changes I felt were noticeable to me. Weighting everything, quality seems to be about the same.'
4,'best location in Times Square','if times square is your location this hotel is perfect\r\nbig rooms can have 3 beds without beeing crowded\r\njust grab your bags to the 8 floor reception if not you will end waiting a lot for them at your room\r\nif your looking for a boutique hotel this is not the option (massive)\r\ni have stay several times for business and fun and will gladly repeat\r\nfor inexpensive italian go for Carmines two blocks away\r\ni would rather have breakfast at cafe europa or starbucks than hotel ,doesnt worth the price'
4,'another perfect stay','is the touristier property ever,but if you are looking for a big size room ,king bed with amazing times square view this is your hotel.when going to new york with kids is our property of choice i believe that for a romantic getaway are better options'
4,'My New Go To Hotel in Manhattan','Initial impressions are even better than previous visits (which weren\'t bad)... good experience at check-in as, after a brief wait, the clerk seemed to go the extra mile to find me a quiet room as requested (away from the St. Paddy\'s Day madness). He did well... I got a very good night\'s sleep. \r\nRoom service for dinner was quite good - both the quality of the food and the hospitality of the order taker. When I asked if there was an ice machine on my floor, he said don\'t worry about it, we\'ll send a bucket up with dinner - and they did - both nights. That was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. \r\nOne downside to the room - it\'s nicely furnished, with a big flat screened TV, but the TV is on top of the chest of drawers (I guess for lack of anywhere else to put it). Unfortunately it\'s a bit of a neck strainer since you have to look up to a level of 6 feet and higher to watch TV. Also, there\'s no view from this particular room, even though it\'s on the 39th floor (3945), thanks to a larger building across the street. \r\nI like having a hotel cab stand, a couple of Starbucks in the hotel, a BankAmerica with ATMs right beside the hotel, and Broadway right next door. Based on this latest experience, this may have become my go to hotel in Manhattan.'
4,'Massive Hotel in Times Square','This is a massive hotel in Times Square - lots of people inside and outside the hotel. The taxi from LaGuardia cost $34 without tip around 7:00 PM on a weeknight.\r\nThere was a very pleasant front desk clerk at reception - his name was Fred. Since the business center is to the immediate left of the check-in area, I used it to print my boarding pass for the next days\' flight. That print job was complementary, but internet usage in the sleeping rooms costs $16.95 per day.\r\nMy room was on the 23rd floor, looking directly out on Times Square. There was no street noise at that level, and the black out curtains kept out the light from the huge all night video billboards on the Square. Furnishings were pretty standard Marriott with a large flat screen TV, king sized bed, sofa and armchair, desk, and plenty of electrical outlets (unusual for a hotel these days). Single cup coffee dispenser in room, but Starbucks on ground floor connected to hotel. Get yourself a muffin for the next morning.\r\nRoom service for dinner was better than I remembered. More than I could eat, but would definitely order it again.'
4,'Reliable Marriott Stay','Stay was fine. Initial check-in was a bit of a wait. Once finally given my room, I was given a key that opened the door to an OCCUPIED room. The guest in the room was just as suprised as I was.\r\nI made the long trek back downstairs to be reassigned, no issues with existing occupants this time. My room overlooked Times Square, which was a bit frustrating b/c the curtains don\'t close completely, so there was light in the room all night. \r\nOtherwise, nice stay, no issues. I like Marriott, b/c I can usually count on a consistent, nice stay.'
2,'Just ok this time','The room was dirty - I forgot to pack socks and felt sticky spots on the carpet. Even grosser was that when I checked into the room, after I was already unpacked, I noticed the toilet contained urine and TP - the bed also looked slightly rumpled. I probably should have just checked out, but there were two beds and it was late and I was exhausted. Looked to me like someone had already checked into my room once and then decided to switch to another. I did ask the front desk to rekey my room, and they did, but I had to talk to a manager to get it done. The first staff person I spoke too insisted that I would have to come downstairs to do. I was already in my pajamas and in wet hair. \r\nAt least the business center staffer was very helpful. Kudos to whoever was working the business center on Thursday 12/8 in the morning - you were the bright spot in a less than stellar Marriott visit. \r\nEspecially annoying that this is the SECOND time that I have been given a key to either an occupied (yes I opened the door on someone a prior time) or previously occupied room. Marriott needs to get their act together. \r\nFinally, the fact that a quesadilla and one glass of white wine was $44 was ridiculous even by NY standards. Will be exploring other options for next NY business trip.'
4,'Enjoyed the Marriott Marquis','I recently stayed at the Marriott Marquis before a 10 day Canada/New England Cruise. The hotel has a great location and is in walking distance to Cental Park as well. The room was comfortable. We stayed on the 32 floor with a nice view of the city and part of Times Square. The service was great. The bed comfortable and the bathroom a nice size. The tv was new and had a great picture. I would stay here again if in the area. I would say that I like staying in the Central Park area a little better over the hustle and bustle of Times Square.'
4,'Enjoyed the New Marriott Marquis','The rooms in the Marriott Marquis at 460 square feet are some of the largest in town. In fact Trump Tower has the same square footage for $200 more a night. The Marquis is in the middle of Times Square and Trump across from Central Park. The rooms are really nice since the renovation and the beds are as comfortable as any 5 star hotel. I really don,t care for the elevators, but the rest of the hotel is quite nice. We also had drinks on the 48th floor View Lounge which is nice.'
2,'Unsafe Hotel. I can not recommend it.','The hotel is an excellent location, with great views from some of its rooms, but you can have this in other hotels in the area without have to stand in an overcrowed hotel, unpersonal and unsafe: anybody can use the elevators from the ground floor to the the rest of floors. As the reception is in the 8th floor, nobody check who is taking the elevators to go to the teather inside the bulding, to the restaurant in the higher floor or...to your own floor and room....It is a really unsafe place.\r\nChoose another hotel in the area'
5,'Right in the heart of New York','In the middle of Times Square, walking distance to the Park, Rockerfeller Centre, Thatres, Empire State, and some great restaurants and bars, this is a great location. The hotel itself is a superb design, with fun glass lifts which worked quickly and efficiently, spacious rooms - ours overlooked the bright lights of Times Square - and some great bars with views across Manhatten. The staff at check-in, the concierge and all the bar staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. We had a fabulous time.'
5,'2nd visit and still impressed','Love this hotel. It is busy but still feels relaxed and the staff are always so helpful and friendly. Make sure that you have a room with a view of Times Square and visit both the bars for their views too. Excellent for the theatres and dining, and for just feeling part of the buzz of New York.'
5,'Excellent Experience','I had not stayed at the Marquis for at least 10 years (so prior to engaging in business travel) and my recollection of it was as a noisy and crowded hotel. Granted, it is still busy and in places noisy, I also found the hotel to be a sanctuary right in the heart of Times Square. I appreciate that this property is one of the few Marriott\'s that still has a dedicated check-in line for Elites and upon check-in my gold status was promptly recognized and I was upgraded to a junior suite on the 42nd floor looking directly down on Times Square. I find that upgrades can be a crap-shoot so receiving such a nice one without asking is always a plus.\r\ni know elevators are elevators, but I cannot help commenting on how unique these are. You enter in your floor prior to getting in the elevator, a little screen tells you which elevator to enter and it takes you directly to your floor. This means no buttons inside. I found that I never waited more than 45 seconds and each trip made no more than 3 other stops.\r\nThe only real critique I have for the property is the relative small size of the concierge lounge for such a large hotel with so many elites. The food was excellent and well stocked, but finding a seat during breakfast hours each morning was a challenge. Otherwise, yes, it is an expensive property, but you are paying for location and Marriott consistency.'
5,'A Very Warm Welcome to a Wonderful Hotel','When I arrived at this hotel, I was welcomed by Farida Alek at the front desk.\r\nI have never had anyone search for so long and so patiently to accomodate me in a marvelous room.\r\nWhat an assest a person such as MS Atek is to the Marriott family.'
5,'Wonderful hotel in the theater district','Another wonderful experience at this hotel. David, at the front desk, was so helpful.\r\nSpacious clean room with such comfortabe beds.\r\nClose to theaters.\r\nEasy walk to subway, restaurants and other attractions'
4,'Definetly a hotel for tourists in the big apple!','We booked this hotel after leaving the Jumeirah Essex hotel wanting to stay 1/2 of the time near Central Park and 1/2 near Times Square. It\'s a hotel you must stay at if you\'re a tourist in NYC. Why? Because there is a taxi pick up area right in the hotel just for Marriott guests. Otherwise good luck getting a taxi in Times Square. Also you have the ticket booth for broadway shows right outside your door for 50\% off or the regular tickets right in the hotel. Starbucks is in the hotel which, believe me, is an easier way of getting coffee than finding a place in Times Square. Kevin and Robert, who checked us in, did everything to get us a connecting room since we had two rooms. Great Job! We got a rate that included breakfast, plus pancakes and waffles. Good buffet. You\'ll leave here not knowing how they run the place with all those people. Concierge polite and gave us directions every time we wanted to go somewhere. It takes a while to get your room cleaned but you can understand why with all the people. Elevator system is confusing at first, but after a while you\'ll get the hang of it. You push which floor you want and then it tells you alphabetically which elevator to get on. Time Square is really busy if you like crowds and the Marriott Marquis is in the middle of it. If you\'re looking for great pizza, John\'s pizza is only a block away and one of the best in NY.'
5,'Enjoyed our trip to NY and our experience with Marriott','My wife and I just stayed in NYC at the Marriott Marquis for 4 nights. We had major concerns about the bedbug issues in many hotels in NYC and chose to stay at the Marquis after reviewing many hotels regarding the various bedbug incidences in NY. In fact, I was traveling to NY for a conference that was held at another hotel in NY that had experienced major issues with bed bugs and we opted to select the Marquis over the conference hotel at a slightly greater price due to the incidents and to also enjoy a higher quality hotel stay. Upon check-in at the Marquis, while we were not able to get a king room upon our late check-in at the reserved price, the hotel had an upgrade king room with a times square view that was a reasonable upgrade price and we accepted. We were most pleased with the room and value. The room was a lot larger and had a view overlooking Times Square directly across from the Disney store. We checked the room, bed and all the most common places for bed bugs and the room was clear of any signs of bedbugs and was spotless in terms of cleanliness. We were very pleased with our entire stay at the Marquis. While we had an incident in our room regarding a leak int he ceiling of the bathroom, the staff, engineers and housecleaning staff were very attentive and resolved the issue within a one hour period. We all know that bad things happen, but how well you respond to meet challenges is the sign of how the operational staff can resolve issues. These folks did a great job and provided excellent service and correcting the problem. The only meal that we enjoyed at the hotel was a late night dessert selection at the rotating restaurant at the top of the hotel - The View. The views were spectacular and the food was outstanding! This is the third time that we have stayed at the Marquis during our NY trips and it is our favorite of all the various hotels in NY. The hotel has the best location - period. The size and quality of the rooms, staff, amenities and convenient access to great shopping, theatre and restaurants is wonderful. We highly recommend that you select the Marriott Marquis for your next stay in NY.'
5,'Great hotel in Times Square!','We traveled to NYC for a week and stayed at the Marriott. We have traveled multiple times over the years to NYC, and this is our favorite hotel in the city of all the different hotels that we have visited. The location to Times Square is excellent and the overall quality and comfort of the rooms is excellent. The rooms are very large and well appointed. The bathroom is fine. My only negative about the room is the quality of the matress. It is not as comfortable as other hotels in this class. We stayed recently in NYC at the Westin and the matress and quality of sleep was superior, but overall the Marriott is our favorite and we will return! The city has strong reputation for many of the hotels having bed bugs and we are very cautious and concerned about this when booking hotels in NYC. We checked our room for any signs and our room was very clean and we found zero signs of any bed bugs. I highly recommend this hotel for your visit to NYC if you are wanting to stay near Times Square.'
4,'Location, Location','This was our 2nd visit to this hotel and the reason again was location, location. To be able to go straight from Times Square or the theatre district to the save haven of your room in a couple of minutes is quite a luxury.\r\nAnother good point of the hotel was the overall service (although we had to call to have our room serviced from the night before at 6:30 pm one evening). There was also a good Italian buffet on Wednesdays for lunch and dinner for just $25.\r\nSome of the downers were construction in the main atrium that began about 7am and a initially confusing elevator system.'
5,'Good Update','Our family of three has stayed at the Marriott each of the last 3 summers and this year we were finally able to enjoy the new updates that have occured there. The rooms are much more modern than before with the removal of the bulky furniture and cabinets which have been replaced by streamlined, comfortable loveseats and large HD televisions. The bathrooms also have new, modern sinks and counter space.\r\nThe updates continue into the hallways and into the 5th floor bar and restaurant area and even the workout spa which overlooks Times Square. The restaurant there has a couple of reasonably priced buffets during the week. While the upgrades are nice, the price of the room also went up.\r\nThe main reason for staying here, of course, is the great location on Times Square. The hotel is a relaxing escape from the hectic pace and bustle of the area. This hotel gives you quick access to the theatre district, (the hotel has it\'s own theatre showing Evita) the ethnic restaurants of 9th avenue and the shopping located on 5th avenue.\r\nWe arrived on a Saturday and walked to 6th Avenue which was blocked off with street vendors and food stalls. I\'m not sure if this occurs every Saturday, but it was an enjoyable experience. \r\nOnce again, great location, good upgrade!'
5,'Once in a lifetime','Having a room at the Marquis (with a view on Times Square) is something you have to live at least once in your life... At night, my best friend and I would just close all the lights in the room, eating a slice of pizza, watching the lights... Beautiful.\r\nBeing in Times Square, the location is perfect. The bar and restaurants level is a nice place to visit. The elevators make you feel like you\'re in Star Trek. \r\nVery very expensive. Since the rooms in other Marriots are just as good as this one, I\'d suggest you stay just one night there, during low season, in a room with a view... for the experience. You\'ll never forget it.'
4,'Ask for a times square view.','I\'ve stayed there for one night during my last trip to NYC (it wasn\'t the first time)... The place is clean and cute, the rooms are big, the beds are comfortable and it\'s in a great location close to many attractions and broadway shows. \r\nIt wouldn\'t be my first choice since I like smaller hotels (cozy) and this one is huge but it is still a great place to stay. \r\nIf you have the budget, ask for a times square view. You won\'t regret it.'
4,'If you want to be in the centre of New York........','This hotel is in Time Square. You couldn\'t be nearer. Just a few blocks from all the other attractions as well, so makes the ideal stay. The rooms are good, though not as modern as you would think. Great coffee making facilities and the views from windows are great. The resaurants are very expensive but you have to eat in the View as it rotates very slowly while you eat good food and the views are brilliant.\r\nGood gym that also overlooks Time Square and is free\r\nOnly down side is the size of the hotel makes it a little inpersonal, but hey you can put up with that for the great location'
5,'Repeat guests...we love the Marquis!','Sixth time at the Marquis and we\'ll keep coming back. The hotel is our favorite in NY despite the location (we don\'t like Times Sq all that much). Why do we stay there? The rooms! They are large by NYC standards (400 sq ft vs. as little as 150 at some other hotels) and are always clean, comfortable and well-appointed. Marriott seems to update the Marquis fairly regularly. The programmable elevators (you get assigned to the fastest elevator) works very well and we rarely wait more than a minute or so.\r\nFrancesco at the front desk started off our last stay on a bright note. Very pleasant and efficient. As we\'re Marriott Rewards Platinum, we were upgraded to a corner room (3424) and couldn\'t have been more pleased. It\'s a bit of a schlep from the elevator core to the room, granted, but when you\'ve been walking MILES in NYC what\'s a few more feet? We enjoyed the gym, the free WiFi offered to Rewards guests, the Starbucks in the lobby and the general comfort and quiet of the room. Amazing quiet, in fact, considering the craziness just 34 floors below! :-)\r\nIt may not be a hotel for everyone, but we\'ve always been happy with it.\r\nHint: learn the NYC subway system. Rather than using the Times Sq station entrance on 42nd, we discovered the 44th/8th entrance. Very close. Also, when possible use the 49th station, which has an entrance at 47th/7th...one block away.'
5,'Seventh time at the Marquis and still love it','We generally avoid large hotels but the NY Marriott Marquis is an exception. Recently stayed there for the seventh time and found that nothing had changed...it\'s still a very good hotel. Rooms are spacious, although our room was a bit odd on this trip in that it was a little smaller than the norm and the door opened OUT into the hall rather than in...maybe it was part of a suite at one time? No worries, though, as it\'s very comfortable and well-appointed. And the best part? Quiet! It\'s a huge hotel and you\'ll rarely hear anyone else. That\'s rare.\r\nLocation can\'t be beat. We actually don\'t like Times Square but it\'s so convenient to all of Manhattan. Nearly every subway line runs through the 42nd St station. Cabs are also very easy to get and Hell\'s Kitchen (next to Times Square) has some great bars and eateries\r\nI have to laugh at people who complain about the elevators...they work AMAZINGLY well. Far better than the old days when people fought for the next available lift. Signage could be better for first-timers, probably.\r\nMy only real complaint is the wonky WiFi. It simply didn\'t work if you weren\'t on the side of the room where the bed was located. At the desk, forget it. So, I was forced to plug in for internet service. Marriott generally charges a lot of money for this but as a Platinum member it was free, so I\'ll let it slide. (If I was paying, I would have disputed this charge and simply purchased an AT&T data package for my iPad!)'
5,'If you like to be in the heart of Times Square, this is it!','I didn\'t choose the Marriott Marquis for it\'s location, but because I knew what I was getting in terms of a hotel room and in NYC, this is big deal, as the size of rooms, decor and recent updates range greatly with NYC hotels. I typically avoid the Times Square area, but this was a quick visit, literally 24 hours in the city and I wanted a clean, comfortable room. \r\nI arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm and my room was not ready, I expected this and I was promised a call to my cell phone when it would be available. So, I turned my luggage over to the bell staff and set out for lunch. As I was returning to the hotel 2 hours later, my phone was ringing and it was a call from the front desk to advise my room was ready, (great timing!). \r\nI booked a standard king bedded room and was assigned room #3859. The room was huge! A lot larger than I anticipated. The view was of the West Side and it was spectacular.\r\nNotables: Exceptionally clean room, nicely appointed. Bath and Body Works amentities in the bathroom. Plenty of towels. Ipod docking station next to the bed. Good channel selection on the TV. \r\nInteraction with staff was limited, but everyone I encountered was friendly and quick with a smile and hello.\r\nOutside noise was not a concern for this room location. HOWEVER.. walls seem to be paper thin, I could clearly hear conversations in surrounding rooms and water running and toilets flushing constantly. I always travel with ear plugs and this was one of the times I was glad I had them on hand!\r\nFor the purpose of this quick trip, the Marquis was a great choice. I choose to walk up to 8th Avenue to get where I needed to go, (August WIlson Theater) therefore avoiding the large crowds and making for easier and faster paced walking.\r\nTimes Square is well, Times Square.. if you crave being in the center of it, you can\'t go wrong with this Marriott. If you want to be confident in having a decent sized room in Manhattan, this is your go to place.'
5,'3rd visit and will continue coming back','I never thought I would enjoy this hotel as much as I do, but I can\'t seem to resist its location when I am in town for one major purpose... Broadway shows. It\'s convenient location, more than ample sized sleeping rooms and friendliness of the staff are what keep me coming back.\r\nLoved our room, was advised at check in that the room had been recently renovated and it appeared so, what got me every time we would return to the room (3343) was how nice & clean it smelled when we walked in, I am a little sensitive to smell, so this was a big deal to me! \r\nThe hotel was busy the weekend I was in town (7/27-30) and sometimes, but really not that often, there would be a bit of a wait for an elevator, but nothing to complain about, I mean, really what do you expect from a hotel this size.. if you don\'t like crowds/waiting there are plenty of lovely boutique hotels you can stay at.\r\nThis time, made it a point to visit more dining venues and while we were generally pleased, you are definitely paying for the experience/location/convenience.. $19.00 cocktails? Yes, they have them and in my opinion, not worth it. Even at the View restaurant, the view is great, however, I will get my drink on elsewhere. By the way, the $8.00 cover charge imposed in the evenings is waived for hotel guests.\r\nDinner at The View (at a prix-fixed cost of $79.00 per person) was not worth it, but again, not surprised and not complaining, I do get it.. but in the future, will spend my money elsewhere. Dinner was nothing special in terms of offerings and overall quality, but it was an enjoyable experience and I really liked our server, Tom, he is very personable and just the right amount of attentiveness.\r\nThere have been some renovations at the Gift Shop and they now offer over priced sandwiches & snacks... so, if you think you are saving money by opting to pick up a quick meal here, think again. But I always like to peruse this shop, cute stuff, even if I am just looking and not buying.\r\nThe room was appointed perfectly and I have to say, these are some of the most comfortable beds I have slept on, perfect night sleep every night. Being on the 33rd floor, its very quiet, no street noise whatsoever. Also, did not hear any noise from the corridor. I could hear neighbor\'s conversations while I was in the bathroom though, but since I am not sleeping in the bathroom, who cares?! By the way, room 3343 is a room with 2 double beds, a pull out couch and faces out over 45th Street, you do have a partial Times Square view.\r\nThank you again to the Marriott Marquis for contributing to another memorable NYC visit.'
2,'So much wrong with this place yet I keep coming back','I have stayed at the Park Central on each of my last 4 visits to New York and I have had a challenging experience every time yet I just keep coming back. In these room stays I have had a variety of miseries to deal with - a room with no working phone or internet throughout my 4 night stay (I had to continually use a UK mobile to call the operator to complain but the expensive irony fell on deaf ears) - if I have been allocated a room served by the small elevator bank there are only two lifts and they usually have one or both lifts out of action with a jaunty apology like So Sorry folks we seem to have dropped the ball on this one or similar. \r\nYet having said this I am returning to Manhattan again in June 2012 and guess what - I have booked the Park Central once again - talk about triumph of hope over bitter experience. On the plus side it is excellently located for my needs with the wonderful Wellington diner directly over the road, PJ Carneys a block or two up 7th avenue and the subway station at 56th and 7th. The hotel itself also has a good lively bar where you can nearly always chat to someone fun and the restaurant (for lunch at least) is excellent. I am just keeping all my fingers crossed for elevators, internet and telephony systems.'
3,'Friendly helpful staff and location is excellent but very expensive for what you get','I was quite harsh on this hotel after a few unfortunate experiences but I was prepared to give it one last chance. I arrived at 2pm and was told by a lovely smiley lady that my room wasn\'t ready (guaranteed check in is 4pm) but that they would upgrade me to the Concierge floor as a reward for returning quite a few times. I was all set an hour later with my key but when I entered the room it was identical to the rooms that I always get. The room is large and clean with a comfortable bed but has no frills whatsoever - no bathrobe, no minibar, not even bottled water and no shaving mirror to help catch those stray bristles. The wifi was OK once we got the access sorted but it is a pay per day and not free as I believe it should be. I am still totally unclear what the benefits of the concierge floor (18th) are but I totally missed them and would not pay for them if I stayed again. The lifts were all working well and it is a great system when operational with automatic pre-allocation of lift by floor number as you select it. The bar is good fun with nice staff and I had a lovely lunch in their restaurant when I arrived.\r\nAll in all it was fine with no major dramas but when I checked my bill at the end it seemed I had paid an awful lot for not very much. Maybe that is just Manhattan for you.'
4,'Muy buena ubicacion','La ubicacion excelente, el servicio muy bueno.\r\nLa contra es que no hablan nada de español.\r\nNo son cálidos para nada, pero el servicio es bueno.-'
4,'Muy Buena Ubicación e Higiene','Me aloje en el hotel 6 nochesb en enero/2012, ya lo habia hecho en el 2009 y esta mejorado en cuanto a servicio y limpieza, lo malo sigue siendo que cobran 14 dolares por dia wi-fi en cualquier lugar del hotel (pero en la esquina tienes un Starbuck que es gratis) y el personal de recepción tiene muy mal humor y solo tienen una persona que habla español. En cuanto a calidad-precio es aceptable.Yo habia tomado una habitación doble y me habian dado una muy pequeña, me queje y me enviaron a una mas comoda en el piso 17, se los recomiendo por la vista expectacular se ve el Times Square. La limpieza excelente.'
5,'3 nights at the PC','I stay here pretty often. I have to say that the quality is very good for the money. Everyone is very hospitable, and Ellen at the front desk always has a big smile!'
5,'5 nights','Ellen was very helpful at the front desk. great room, great bed, lots of peace and quiet in my corner room. people must be looking for reasons to complain if they mention the elevators- the system worked fine for me.'
4,'Excelente custo benefício em Manhattan','Hotel confortável, bem localizado, com funcionários atenciosos e com um preço justo.'
4,'Very good for families.','The room accommodates two adults and two children / teens. Breakfast is plentiful with a good range of breads and fruits. The location is excellent.'
5,'Muy bien ubicado y comodo acceso.','Cumple perfectamente con las espectativas, muy bien ubicado con una entrada al subte en la misma entrada del hotel, ojo con las habitaciones mas economicas, son muy chicas. El resto nada que objetar.'
3,'Muy buena ubicación pero se esta dejando estar','Voy a este hotel cada vez que viajo a NY realmente tiene una ubicación de privilegio, estación de subte en la puerta, lugares para comer a la noche a no mas de media cuadra, y a pocas cuadras de Time Square, El tema es que vea cada vez que vuelvo, mas dejadez en la atención, y el los servicios, el trato de las personas en el front desk deja mucho que desear, realmente trabajan a desgano, y lo compruebo cada vez que me registro.\r\nLos baños son aceptables, viejos y mal mantenidos.\r\nEs política del hotel no dar NUNCA la habitación antes de las 16.00 hs tengan o no disponibilidad, no entiendo porque pero es así.\r\nHay que tener en cuenta que es un hotel muy grande y si la habitación esta pro debajo del piso 10 (tiene 25 pisos) en horario pico va a ser muy difícil poder bajar rápido, los ascensores vienen llenos de gente desde arriba y hay que esperar varios.\r\nEn resumen es un muy buen hotel por la ubicación, pero no esperen un buen servicio.'
4,'Excellent stay in a good value for money hotel','This is a fine hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Yes the lifts were slow, but the hotel has done the best they can. You know the lifts are slow, so plan ahead!\r\nOne dollar a day for the chambermaid works wonders in having your room cleaned when you want and getting extra towels etc. The rooms were a good size and contained all the usual things. Bathrooms clean and spacious with ample hot water.\r\nLocation was excellent and there are many cafes etc nearby. Can thoroughly recommend Petrossian (182 W57th) for beakfast and fabbo coffee.'
4,'Another excellent stay','Third visit to the Park Central in 18 months. This time I had a room on the W56th Street side. The slightly annoying lift problem, ofetn referred to does not seem to be an issue on this side. I rarely had to wait for the lift (elevator). The staff were efficient as always.\r\nRecommended. Good location, good price.'
3,'A tad shabby','It was Ok. We had a few glitches with checking in. Our room was not ready and then they gave away our room, and eventually they gave us a quiet room on a lower floor. It was resolved.\r\nMy friends\' bedding looked clean but there was someone else\'s hair on the sheets....not cool. They sent up housekeeping to change the bedding. It was resolved.\r\nUltimately we slept well and our room was quiet and a nice size.\r\nGreat location.'
4,'Wonderful experience!','My friend and I love to come to NYC and stay over one night a month and run and do and see everything we can. The location of the Park Central Hotel is perfect for us. We had an exceptional time this last week. Elizabeth, the guest relations manager was especially helpful and allowed us early check in. We were given a wonderful upgrade of a suite instead of a room with two double beds. It was terrific, with great light, quiet and on a high floor. It was immaculately clean and had a wonderfully comfortable bed. The staff were all helpful and polite. We stayed here about 6 months ago and did not have such a great experience, although problems were rectified. They seem to be trying harder to please. The Park Central could use an updating, but for now it is a great value with a great location. \r\nWe would happily come back here again.'
4,'Always good for us','We have been very happy with our accommodations at the Park Central Hotel. The location can\'t be beat for going in any direction either by walking or by taking public transportation.\r\nThe hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating and we\'ve managed to get an upgrade each time to a better room. The bed is very comfortable and the room and bathroom are very clean.\r\nElizabeth, guest relations manager is truly wonderful with making our visits really special.\r\nThe Park Central Hotel can use an updating. the carpeting is tired as are the curtains and the art work on the walls. In spite of those items, The Park Central is our home away from home in New York City.'
5,'How wonderful!','A home away from home!\r\nThe staff was so friendly and considerate. Angela, David, \r\nSaleen, and Elizabeth you are so amazing! I\'ve been coming to New York for over 50 years and this has been my go to hotel for over 30! If there was a higher rating to give I would! Perfect location too!'
5,'Again Angela, David, and Saleem make me feel like it\'s my home away from home.','They are very professional and effiecient while always being very pleasant and a joy to deal with. I always recommend this hotel to my fellow business travelers and they always thank me because the service is wonderful. Please tell Angela, Saleem, David and others thank you!'
3,'Una muy buena elección','Es un hotel muy bien ubicado ,limpio , trato correcto , con la habitación tranquila .'
5,'Serviciales !!!!','Estuve en el Park Central esta navidad 2010 . La habitación superior excelente , el desayuno muy bien servido , siempre atentos en todo y dispuestos a resolver cualquier inconveniente. Como el aeropuerto se cerró por 2 días , tuve que volver al hotel y alojarme nuevamente y enseguida resolvieron mi pedido.\r\nSaludos ,Marisel5939'
3,'3 good things about this hotel: 1. Location 2. Location and 3. Location :-)','....that about sums up my experience of this hotel. The location is excellent. Its in mid-town Manhattan, with Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square and the shopping districk of 5th Avenue within easy reach. \r\nThe service wasn\'t great, though. Though I had a booking, some confusion led to a 2 hour wait when I landed there after a red eye (quite literally) flight. Room service used to forget to replenish one or the other stuff required for coffee-either the coffee, creamer or sugar. When I asked for it, I was told that the hotel doesn\'t provide creamer for coffee! Rather, impolite, I think! The concierge was good and they cheerfully provided me directions and a subway map when asked.'
4,'Clean rooms, great location','This hotel is a good one if you are on a business trip (and your work place is in mid town Manhattan) or if you are on a holiday and plan to spend most of the day sightseeing. The rooms are small, but clean. The service is strictly okay-not great. What it has going for it is its great location. If you want to do sightseeing, Rockefeller, Central Park and other mid town attractions are a walk away.'
5,'Worth Staying','My husband & I had an excellent experience. We booked the hotel without knowing much about it. It definitely exceeded our expectations. The room was very clean as was the lobby. The hotel was undergoing some renos but that wasn\'t an inconvenience to us. One day we came back to the room to find there was a leak in the bathroom - we were immediately moved to another room w/o any hassles or delays considering the hotel was busy checking in guests. The location of the hotel is fantastic - right on a subway line.'
4,'Thumbs Up!','We stayed over July 4th wkend. No complaints. The last time we stayed here was 5 years ago. This time was an even better experience. The hotel has been renovated since our last stay. It looks great, the lobby, rooms,etc. We had no issues w/ check in or check out. Can\'t beat the location - Central Park is just a few blocks away, Starbucks and the subway line right outside the door! Highly recommend!'
5,'Second home . . .','For the past 6 years I have lived and worked in Central Africa and travel to NYC 1-3 times a year for business. After trying many NYC locations, I now stay exclusively at the Park Central when I\'m in the city. I think it\'s the best hotel in its price class in the city. The staff are incredibly helpful. On my last trip I had a very noisy neighbor; notified the staff and they were very apologetic, immediately offered to help me move. But then they went above and beyond by giving me three keys and letting me go look at the rooms available and pick the one I liked the best. When I check in, staff often recognize me and welcome me back (thanks Ellen for being so great and always being so cheerful!). If my flight arrives early morning and the room isn\'t ready, the staff always give me accurate information about when I will be able to move in, and you really get the sense they are working hard to make it happen. When you are walking around the hotel, every staff person greets you. I spend roughly 60 nights a year in hotels, this is most welcoming service I\'ve ever experienced. The rooms are clean and bright with nice furnishings. Some would say they are not huge but compared to other hotels in NYC they are the largest and most comfortable I\'ve found in this price range. You don\'t have to sit on the bed to work at the desk, or back into the closet to open the cabinet drawers. I don\'t want to spend more for a large suite when I\'m never in my room! And that\'s one of the best things about Park Central - you are in the perfect location. Step out the door and turn right - you\'re in Times Square in 5 minutes; turn left - you\'re in Central Park in 5 minutes. Go straight, you\'re shopping. I\'ve come to think of the Park Central as my second home and that\'s something I never thought possible with a hotel particularly in New York.'
5,'Park Central Continues to Impress','This is my second review of Park Central, having just spent an additional 8 nights there. Park Central continues to impress. Given the number of people who transition through the hotel every day, the efforts of the front-desk staff to accommodate everyone is really impressive. The check-in process moves quickly, even if - when your first walk in - there appears to be a long line. I particularly want to thank Ellen at the front desk for her help selecting a wonderful room - with a great view of Broadway. She called soon after I checked in to make sure everything was ok (which it was). This trip I spent time daily in the gym which is one of the hotel\'s best kept secrets. Usually empty, the gym is one of the best-equipped hotel gyms I\'ve seen; I love that the treadmills look down on 7th avenue. Also, the staff in the baggage storage area were great - helped me store some bags for a couple days while I was attending a conference. Just booked a 2-week stay in December.'
5,'A very good hotel.','Over the years, I have stayed in any number of five star hotels around the world. The Park Central, though, is easily one of this business guy\'s favorites, and the value for the money is tremendous. I\'ve stayed here over a dozen times and always been very satisfied, particularly when I am not on expenses and paying from my own pocket. The location is great, the rooms reeaonably spacious, and are always clean. The elevator system can be a little confusing, but you quickly figure it out. And the desk staff is friendly and very helpful. On several occasions, Elizabeth has been particularly helpful. So I rate this place very highly. And it can\'t be beat for the price.'
5,'The best hotel in NY for the money','I have stayed at this hotel at lest ten times (usually on business) and am very satisfied. The location is excellent and the rooms more than adequate and clean. The lobby can sometimes be jammed with tourists and families from Europe, but the price makes that easily tolerable. As a regular visitor, I also rate highly people behind the desk like Elizabeth and Ricky, to name two, who are both willing and very helpful, whgich is not always the case at NY hotels.'
5,'Excellent Hotel!','Myself and my best friend stayed at this hotel for my 21st birthday in February 2010. We were delayed 36 hours and thought we would have a problem checking in. We rung the hotel in advanced and explained the situation, they were very accommodating and didn\'t charge us for the night we didn\'t stay at the hotel. I had read several reviews saying the service at reception was slow and unfriendly, however upon arrival it was quick and the service was fantastic. The only problem we had concerned our breakfast coupons! We had to go back the next day and get the correct ones. \r\nThe breakfast each morning was delicious with mini boxes of cereal, make your own waffles and a small fried section. Just right to start you off when you are going to be busy shopping or sight seeing in NY! \r\nThe hotels location was perfect, a short walk around the corner from Central Park and around a 5 minute walk into Times Square. There is also a subway station on the side of the hotel which is very handy. \r\nThe room we booked was a double double. The beds were very comfy and it was a very spacious room! Each day our room was cleaned and the toiletries were replenished. The only fault I could see was the remote control to the TV had been hidden underneath one of the beds! \r\nOverall this is a wonderful hotel and I cannot wait to book it again!'
5,Outstanding.,'This is my third stay at the Park Central in New York City. I could not recommend it enough. Each time I have stayed I have not been disappointed. The level of service is wonderful, from reservations, room service, front desk and house keeping. Great room rates and very spacious rooms, unlike most NYC hotel rooms. Perfect location! Throughout my stay Elizabeth Cacovic was a pleasure to deal with. I had a small issue where I could not receive any cell reception in my room and she quickly sorted this problem a moved me to another room with no problem. They don\'t have a swimming pool but the fitness centre is very high tech!\r\nI will be back again Park Central! Keep up the excellent work!'
4,'convenience and attention','Park Central has become my place to stay when going to the Opera or Carnegie Hall. It is conveniently located, allowing one to easily walk to the Met. This past stay, I appreciated the response from the hotel\'s staff when we had a problem with the hair dryer. Stanley promptly came to the room and installed a new hair dryer. He was thorough and very polite.'
3,'Location but warm','Park Central is well located in Manhattan to go either uptown or downtown. However, room was too warm the entire time we were there. There was no adjusting the temperature in spite of turning the control to cold. The other issue was having a late check-out assured by the front desk to find our room key no longer worked. Although this was remedied by the front desk it added to our annoyance brought on by a sleepless night in a hot room.'
5,'Excellent location and front desk service','Arrived early and Ellen at the front desk found us a room immediately and was very friendly! I was very happy with the cleanliness of the room. The location of the hotel is amazing. . .anywhere you want to go in NYC and you\'re just a short walk away. We had a great time and we\'re already planning our next trip.'
5,TravelingAndKids,'This hotel is wonderful for a romantic weekend away. What a pleasant surprise to find it\'s also a great place to get away with the kids! Ellen at the front desk went above and beyond to ensure my kids were comfortable. We had a great time and can\'t wait to go back. Thank you Park Central. . . From a happy mom'
1,'Difficult Staff, Last Stay Here','This was my 3rd year staying at this hotel. Prior to this experience I had no problems. This one was quite a nightmare. I was in NYC for the US Open tennis and went thru a sports travel agency for my room at this hotel, as I always did. It was one of the cheapest available, but I figure I am not in the room much except for at nite and it was a decent enough place. I had a driver take me from Pa to NYC as I was solo and felt more comfortable that way. He left me off and when I went to check in, they asked for my driver\'s liscence. I didn\'t have it with me, or any other form of photo id ( dumb I know but not really the point). \r\nThey would not check me into the hotel. Luckily the driver didn\'t yet leave and I ran out to him to try to help. The man at the desk was very rude. He didn\'t care about leaving a female alone in the city whatsoever. When I tried to contact my travel agency, the name of the person on my confirmation letter was not staying at this hotel and therefore they couldn\'t get me in touch with anyone else staying there from the travel company. They wouldn\'t even try. I had to go back with the driver, call my aunt who is a knowledgeable traveler ( who yelled at me for 5 min. about not having ID with me :) called the manager to pleade my case. Eventually the manager said ok provided my aunt fed ex me my liscence for the next day. I have to say I was never so scared in all my life and I did learn a lesson. However, when I met up with my travel agency, they were not happy with the way I was treated. By the end of the trip they informed me they would no longer be using this hotel because they were not happy with their service. After this experience I would never stay here again. I just felt the staff could have been more helpful to me and to think they would leave someone on the streets of NYC alone was just unbelievable.'
5,'genial como siempre','Esta es la sexta vez que nos alojamos en el Park Central y ha sido fantástico como siempre.\r\nBuena situación, personal amable y las habitaciones amplias y limpias.\r\nSin duda volveremos.'
5,'siempre volvemos','Llevamos viajando 6 anos a nueva York, dos veces al año y desde que conocimos el hotel es nuestra casa en Nueva York, buena situación, buen servicio y buenas instalaciones.\r\nTrabajamos como recepcionistas en un hotel en Madrid y nunca hemos tenido un problema en las veces que nos hemos alojado.\r\nBuen lugar para conocer la ciudad. \r\nEsperamos volver muy muy pronto.'
4,'gutes preis/leistungsverhältnis','lage sehr gut, personal sehr verständnisvoll, wir durften das zimmer wechseln, da das erste zimmer zu laut war. das zweite zimmer war allerdings nicht renoviert und während unseres aufenthaltes wurde das zimer nicht gesaugt o.ä. Insgesamt ist aber ein gutes Preis Leistungsverhältnis. Manche Zimmer gehen auf den Hinterhof, dort sind die Klimaanlagen ziemlich laut, wir waren zuerst in einem solchen Zimmer. das zweite zimmer lag zur Nebenstraße, was viel ruhiger war.'
4,'gute wahl','die lage ist perfekt, direkt am central park und beim Times Square. wir waren jetzt bereits zweimal in diesem Hotel und waren zufrieden. Beim ersten Besuch hatten wir ein großes und renoviertes Zimmer zum Hof, das war sehr ruhig und sauber.\r\nBeim letzten mal hatten wir ein kleineres, nicht renoviertes zimmer, aber dafür vom BEtt aus den besten Blick auf den Times square.\r\nIch würde immer wieder ins Park Central gehen.'
5,'VP Marketing','Hello every one, I have been several times at the Park Central and it become my second home in my NYC visits. He is very well located and the service is exellent but one of my main reason is Elizabeth Cacovic the Guest Relations Manager that allways smile, remember and helping me fill that I choose the right choise. It would\'nt my last time and I\'ll be back for sure'
5,'Great pepole','Park Central Hotel became my home hotel when I visiting NYC. I can say it well located, the rooms are nice and clean, good food and others. But the main reasons are the people! the excellent service they are providing with a smile and with a big heart!That\'s what keep me come back everytime. Especelly I thanks Elizabeth for her five stars efforts to make my staying pleasent and comforteballe. I\'ll be back for sure.'
5,'Loved it','I loved the hotel. I really loved it. Staff were so nice and friendly, Could not do enough for you. Room was clean big and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know. It is so central to everything. 5 mins from everywhere.'
5,'Loved this Hotel','Staff so friendly. Great location. Will return. It\'s just beside everything.'
4,'Huge Rooms, at least for NYC','This hotel is one of three that are the \'recommended\' hotels by my company due to it\'s close proximity to our NYC office. At a time when NYC hotel rates were through the roof, I was happy with the price I paid, although it\'s still ridiculous compared to other cities.\r\nBased on another reviewer\'s advice, I recommended a room on a high floor which worked out very well. These rooms must have been renovated and I\'m not sure if I got an upgrade or not, but the room was huge by NYC standards. It was right across from the elevators which I didn\'t really like, but it ended up being okay. There was a decent size closet when you enter the room, with a safe, then the bed which was pretty comfortable, but very clean (3-piece sheets, etc) and then a fairly spacious sitting area with the desk and TV. The bathroom was fine, not fantastic, but plenty of counter space.\r\nMy main complaint about the hotel is that the air is impossible to find. After calling down several time with them giving me detailed info, I finally found the little slot that you have to touch just right in order for the top to pop up to allow you to change it. I was freezing when I woke up the first morning (I had arrived very late at night so didn\'t fully explore the room) and after pulling back the curtains, I realized that there was a full door to the outside of the building that wasn\'t locked and therefore was cracked just the slightest bit open, letting in cold air. This is extremely dangerous regardless and I checked each night to make sure that door was secured, but I\'m surprised they can have that on the 21st floor to begin with.\r\nI had trouble getting the internet to work and later learned it was an issue with my laptop, but there is an outside number to call and I\'ve never had such helpful service.\r\nThe location was perfect, a short walk to Madison and 5th avenues and although a bit farther, walking to Times Square isn\'t out. I was there for business so I didn\'t get to see actual distances to other places. I know it\'s very near to Central Park as well.\r\nI didn\'t eat or drink at the hotel - although they left water by the bed which was a nice touch, but there were plenty of places to choose from just outside the hotel.\r\nFor the price I got during an otherwise expensive time, and the size and quality of the room, I would definitely consider this hotel again and recommend it to others.'
2,'Third Room was Close enough to the Charm','I had a great stay here in October and reviewed the hotel very favorably back then. I was in town with 15 colleagues in January and we had gotten a great group rate to stay at this hotel, including upgraded rooms (which should have been the same room type I stayed in back in November). The hotel has a great location near our office and with hotel rates so high in NYC, we were happy to find an affordable option, especially one I could recommend firsthand from my last stay.\r\nUnfortunately it was an absolute disaster. I arrived at about 1am Monday morning, got checked in, went up to a room and straight to the bathroom only to find it had not been cleaned (see photo). Whatever was in there had been sitting for a while and the bowl looked all around. There were also hairs on the bathroom floor, several, which just made me feel that the room had not been cleaned. I immediately went downstairs and said that room was not acceptable. Btw, the room size and quality was MUCH worse than what I experienced in the upgraded room before. \r\nI was given another room, no apology for the problem in the first room, although I was told to call downstairs to let them know if the room was okay. But that point I was exhausted and just needed to get some sleep, so when I got in the room and the toilet was clean (although there was still a hair on the bathroom floor), I just made sure to check the matress and sheets for bedbugs (no signs of everything) before going to bed.\r\nOverall, both of the rooms were smaller than I had been in and overall looked very dingy, old and in general like they need a good cleaned (for example, don\'t lose the remote behind the nightstand, it\'s filthy back there!, I didn\'t want to walk on the carpet barefooted). \r\nIf it was only me, I probably wouldn\'t stayed in the second room without an issue. I have never changed rooms for such a problem in the past and I spent more than 50 nights a year in hotels of all star levels. I was mortified when I got to work though and heard that nearly every colleague I was staying with had had pretty bad problems. I couldn\'t believe this had happened after my good stay before! I took notes of all the problems and called my hotel contact at lunch to say we all needed to be in better rooms or we\'d be checking out. Here are the problems that were shared with me: toilet wouldn\'t flush (2 people, one it was fixed for), shower wouldn\'t drain (several people), hair on the floor, generally not up to a clean standard, phone was broken, remote was missing from one of the rooms, sheets were dirty and had to be changed on one room. I was shocked that there were such problems. My colleagues and I have reasonable expectations of having a clean room where things work -- nothing fancy, just that.\r\nWhen I called, and all throughout my dealings with the hotel, I really don\'t have many complaints. They seemed shocked to hear about the problems and really tried to help. While it did take a bit of back and forth, and it still wasn\'t great when we moved rooms, I have to say that they handled it pretty well. I first talked to my contact who I had negotiated the rates with. I found out that only a few of us were in the negotiated deluxe rooms -- i said we all needed to be in the rooms and she said that she could upgrade me to a suite, but they were sold out of deluxe rooms... what?! that\'s what we PAID to be in! I told her she needed to refund our entire bill and we\'d be moving hotels... well, then the GM called back and said he would move us all Not sure where the rooms magically came from. I got put in a nice suite, clean, good size, I had no complaints. Some of my colleagues were fine with their new rooms, although there was still a handful who said there was no apparent difference between the Deluxe room and the other room they were in (no cleaner, no newer, no bigger, etc), although at least everything worked in the room.\r\nThis was pretty disappointing. I met with the GM and we did work out a better deal, but overall it was such a disappointing experience that the hotel just was not up to a good standard. If it was just my room that needed to be changed, that would be one thing. I know things happen, but when 90\% of my group was appalled by their room, had to change rooms up to 3 times, that\'s just unacceptable. \r\nIt\'s too bad b/c I need to plan a lot of trainings in NYC and we\'re not taking any chances this time and staying at the W instead.\r\nEven in the suite I was in, there was a dull sound of a dishwasher/washer just outside of the back corner of the room (24th fl). If my husband was with me, he probably wouldn\'t have had any problem sleeping, but it was obnoxious to me and I had to wear earplugs.\r\nOverall, I feel that once the issue was elevated, they were trying to help and were quick in responding and trying to find a solution. Definitely made concessions that helped but at the end of the day, we weren\'t in the rooms we were supposed to be in, and even when we were, there were problems with them, even several days in and after talking to everyone. Management has to clean up for poor front desk and housekeeping staff. checkout was fast and were able to stick to what they promised. bottom line, really depends on the room. i\'ve now stayed in two very solid rooms for the price, but also saw 2 that were unacceptable, along with all those that were unacceptable to my colleagues.'
1,'Hostile attitude from DAVID','This is our fourth running stay in this Hotel. We not only enjoy it but also recommend it to all our friends and acquaintances for its excellent service. However, a huge drawback is the lousy attention of front desk DAVID (whose last name we ignore). \r\nThe first written complain was about 4 years ago. We went to this hotel with my mother, who is an old person, and the mistreated that she has recibed was intolerable.\r\nThis is our second formal negative feedback, but nothing has happened so far because last week when we were there once again we were mistreated for just requesting a change of room card. It `s always the same wituh this person. He has a permanent hostile attitude towards passangers / customers in general and especially in our case.'
5,'Gracias NILSA','It´s been 4 consecutive years in which we have been staying in this hotel. Beyond the excellent location and that we like the hotel very much, I would like to emphasize that the one of the razons that makes us stay at the Park Central, is NILSA who works at the front desk. From the first year her attention has been magnificent, extremely friendly and efficient, She made it possible that we have some excellent days of holiday. Nilsa Thanks again'
5,'Great location, great rates, big rooms for NYC','We really enjoyed the Park Central. While the hotel seems a little worn in the public areas (nothing terrible but not that brand new feel), the location on 56th and 7th cannot be beat. Two blocks from the park, 5 or 6 to Times Square, and 100 feet to the Carnegie deli.\r\nThe room was perfect size, clean and the bed was very comfortable. If you want to stay in the city this is the place'
5,'Loved every min','I have just returned from staying in the Park Central hotel for 6 nights with my parents, this is my third time in New york and i would def go back and stay in this hotel it was perfect in everyway. When we arrived our room wasnt ready but we knew this might happen as it states this on their website that check in is frm 4pm so we just went next door to have a coffee in starbucks. When we got to our room it was perfect 2 nice size beds ,plasma tv, lovely clean bathroom coffee making facilites it was just perfect. \r\nLocation was even better when you step out of the front door and turn to your right times square was hitting us in the face, we were only a 5 mins walk from there and if u turned left you were right into central park it was just perfect. We stayed on the breakfast package which saved us a fortune, you can have whatever you like from a hot breakfast to cereals, fruit, pastries, waffles, and juices. We also ate in the restaurant for dinner twice and both times the food was fantastic. There is nothing in this hotel that i could fault, the staff were very friendly and would help you out if you needed any info from sightseeing to eating out. If your looking for a central hotel thats always busy with people coming and going this is the perfect hotel for you.'
4,'Another great stay in Park Central','I have just returned from a 6 night stay in Park Central Hotel, this is my 2nd time staying here and like the last time it was fantastic. There were 3 of us staying in the one room, the first room we got was a bit small and we weren`t totally happy with it, we went to reception and in a matter of minutes we were relocated to a bigger room, the girl on reception couldn`t be more helpful. Ignore all these bad reviews about this hotel, we had no problems with the elevators or staff or anything else in this hotel. We will be returning to Park Central again for another fantastic stay in the future.'
5,'Park Central treats you like family','My frequent stays at Park Central New York always begin with a speedy check-in by friendly staff. It only gets better from there. My room is always clean and spacious, usually with one of the best views in the city of bustling 7th Avenue and the Central Park/Times Square district. The few times I\'ve needed to call for assitance with a cranky heater or more bathroom towels, the response has been quick and efficient. Guest Relations Manager, Drita Oroshi, has been especially helpful and always makes me feel like part of the Park Central family. Finally, I love the location. The hotel is within walking distance to Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Columbus Circle and some of the finest shopping and restaurants in the world. And the cost is definitely reasonble by New York standards. For the money, I am convinced Park Central is the best hotel in New York. Terry Edmonds'
5,'Park Central Keeps Getting Better','This is my second review of the Park Central in NY City. I am re-reviewing the hotel, because in my subsequent return visits, I have noticed that the hotel\'s already excellent customer service is getting even better. In an age when customer service often means being put on hold for hours or talking to a computerized recording, the staff at Park Central always offers personal, warm and expert service, whether the issue is related to room conditions, billing or sight-seeing recommendations. I want to especially commend, Guest Relations Manager, Drita Oroshi, for her attentiveness and help and front desk reservationist, Ellen, for her expert assistance whether I am coming or leaving. New York has many physically luxurious hotels, but I have not found one that offers the luxury service of Park Central.'
4,'It\'s really all about the people','I arrived at Park Central Hotel a little after 7am, off a cross-Atlantic flight to JFK. As I walked up to the front desk, I knew that the chances they’d check me in that early were slim to none. I didn’t manage to get much sleep on the way in, so I was tired. I really wanted to get to a room, and get a couple of hours of sleep in before I head out again for a full day of meetings. Right before reaching the front desk, I was greeted by Elizabeth. She asked me how can she be of help, and I told her I simply wanted to check in. She said that they are sold out, and afraid finding a room will be very difficult. So, I explained to her my situation, and told her that if I don’t get some sleep, I’m going to have a crappy day and even crappier meetings. At that point, she smiled (you’ll know her by her warm smile), and said she’ll try to figure something out for me. After a few minutes on the keyboard, she found me a room (1160) – which she said wasn’t the best, but that I could use it for now, and then ask for a room change later (and that she’d take care of that as well). \r\nElizabeth’s service and personal attention were delightful. She really made the difference for me that day. She reminded me that in the service industry, it’s really all about people; the friendly smile, the extra effort, the willingness to do more to make a guest feel truly welcome. \r\nThe next time I’m in NYC, I’ll very likely stay at Park Central – not because it’s a nice hotel, nor because of its good location, nor even because of the reasonable rates. The truth is if I go back, it will be because of the high level of service delivered by people like Elizabeth.'
5,'Friendly staff and great service','This is my second stay at Park Central. I had missed my connection to JFK in Atlanta, and arrived at Park Central on the same day I\'m supposed to checkout (I only had a reservation for 1 night). Needless to say, I was late for my meetings (already missed a couple), and in desperate need for a shower and a place to change. I expected they will basically say that they are sorry, and they can\'t help as usually this hotel is packed. I was greeted at the front desk by Ellen, who was very understanding and accommodating. Not only did she not turn me away, but offered me an upgraded room and told me I could stay until I\'m done with my meetings, and ready to head to the airport. \r\nI\'ll be in NYC again this month, and will be looking forward to staying at Park Central again.'
5,'ottimo - consigliatissimo','posizione ottima, stanze enormi e ben servite, pulizia quotidiana ottima, silenzioso, lo consiglio vivamente!!'
5,'ASSOLUTAMENTE FANTASTICO!!!','albergo spettacolare, dietro il central park, david letterman show e broadway. metro sotto l\'albergo, times square a 3 minuti a piedi, staff ottimo, camere pulitissime, tutto fantastico!!!\r\nconnessione internet economica, pieno di locali per la colazione nelle vicinanze, davvero una vacanza fantastica e l\'albergo ha fatto la sua parte!!'
3,'Why not !','The location of this hotel is just perfect ! The lady at the check-in was not welcoming at all, spoke so quickly that I did not even understand all she said ! My room was already paid, there is no minibar in the room but she still needed to guarantee $100.- on my CC. This is maybe a coincidence but my card was blocked since then. The bank called me the following morning to tell me that it has been used for a few 1000 dollars on internet during the night ... strange ...\r\nI had, according to the floor plan, the biggest room, nice but no view at all, wrong side ! The bathroom is not that nice either. Nowhere to put your toilet things and the pressure of the shower was just inexistant. Nice big TV though and a good and comfortable bed. Slept well. The worst of all is the internet access. You pay $14.00 for 24 hours ... per PC !!! As we were 2 working, it cost us $28.00 for 24 hours !!! This is just robbery. I balance between good for some things and bad for some other things ... Next time I will try to find a better one but, why not going back there ... it will all depend on the offer.'
2,'No service, no smile, dirty and expensive !','I have stayed there twice unfortunately, at the beginning of my USA tour and at the end (booked in advance), but never again ! There is not much to say apart from being dirty (I wonder what the carpets in the rooms are hiding), unfriendly hotel and personnel giving absolute minimum service ! A smile ? NEVER !!!!! … but always pulling out a hand for a tip. There are not even closing curtains in the rooms which means that you have the sun waking you up at 7am !\r\nThe room not ready before 4pm. As we were there at 1pm we had to give them our luggage. US$4.- per bag ! Slow wifi for $15.- !\r\nOne good thing though, the location but there are other hotels in the neighourhood for the next time.'
5,'front desk service','I had traveled all day on business. I arrived to learn that my room was not ready. The front desk manager, Ellen, and Nilsa, spent 15 minutes getting me a great room. The team is always going out their way to provide great service'
5,'Best place to stay near Central Park and theater distrct!','I have been going to this hotel for several years. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The front desk team welcomes me with sincere warmth. They always do their best with guests from out of town. Defintely a great place. The restuarants near the hotel are great and you are five minutes from Times Square'
4,'good value for the money','Second stay at the Park Central in the last couple of years. It\'s a busy hotel and one that\'s apparently very popular with international tourists (a plus in my book as it creates a wonderful level of excitement in the public spaces). \r\nIt certainly is one of the older NYC hotels, and she\'s showing her age, especially in the rooms. They\'re clean and comfortable -- for sure -- but a bit dated and worn around the edges. The heating/air-conditioning system is definitely mid-20th century. The room was stuffy and warm when I checked in but the windows open -- a rarity among NYC hotels -- so I was able to get comfortable quickly. \r\nThe service was fine. Very good, in fact. Front desk, concierge, bar and restaurant staff were friendly, attentive and efficient without being officious. I felt quite welcomed and at home. \r\nThe bar was a bit sterile but otherwise enjoyable. The hotel restaurant was a bit steep in price for dinner, but lunch seemed fairly priced and well-done. \r\nOnly a couple of concerns and there were minor:\r\n1) No coffee-maker in the rooms? That seems to be standard these days. \r\n2) $28 for the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant? That seems a bit excessive given the limited items on the buffet. For that much, I would have liked a made-to-order omelet station. Luckily, there are a couple of breakfast places within one block of the hotel.'
2,'Visited again: it\'s like watching a place die ...','Wow, how things can change in the hotel business! The hotel staff who used to be friendly, warm and welcoming have become distant, cold and arrogant. I\'m talking about the front desk staff. Not at all helpful. Not at all concerned about the quality of interaction or serving the customer. \r\nThe room was not at all acceptable: slow drains in the both the sink and the tub. Uncomfortable bed. HVAC system not yet set to air-conditioning so even the coolest setting pumped out heat. We had the windows open 24/7 during our visit but the room was STILL like a sauna. \r\nI stopped by the front desk the morning after checking in and asked if the drains could be snaked. I was assured this would be taken care of, but it was not. \r\nThat evening, I asked if we could be moved to another room because of the standing water in the tub and the sink AND the sauna-like conditions of the room. We\'ll get back to you was the reply. Never heard back. \r\nI avoided the restaurant completely as I remembered the $35 breakfast buffet from my last visit. Too many good breakfast options within two blocks to pay that kind of money.\r\nNoise. I realize that NYC hotels must cater to groups in order to fill rooms, but the noise in the lobbies from the hundreds of kids swarming the place was just wrong. There was never an attempt to control this hysteria. \r\nOn the way out this morning, one of the concierge staff members followed me across the lobby trying to get me to accept the offer of a car service to the airport. He kept insisting that $50 was the same price as a cab. Ha! I\'m not some first-time tourist to NYC. Finally I said, Does that include tip and tolls, and will the driver accept a credit card? No, no and no was the reply. Yea, right. I ended up at LaGuardia with a $30 trip charge and $5 toll charge. With tip: $42. I know that extra money is a great motivator, but having the concierge staff pimp for the car service drivers is an annoyance, not a service.\r\nOn the good side, the housekeepers are wonderful. \r\nI need to find a new Times Square hotel. As I say in the title, I felt like I had revisited an old friend/relative who had suddenly stepped over that line into a death spiral. I can\'t help but wonder if the Park Central is spiraling down. It had been such a reasonably priced hotel option with decent service and a good atmosphere. \r\nIt\'s very disappointing.'
4,'Large rooms, convenient location, tiny bathroom, friendly staff','On the positive side, the Affinia Manhattan was clean, firm bed, pillow menu (choice of hypo-allergenic, buckwheat, or Swedish memory pillows), the room was large, the bathroom was stocked with Aveda products, and the kitchen was well-equipped (coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee, service for 4, toaster, stove/oven, microwave, large fridge, can opener, and cork screw and wine glasses). The staff was friendly...I was asked by 3 different people at check out if everything had been satisfactory with my stay. \r\nAmenities also include web-tv or high speed internet acces which was abou $10 for a 24-hour period. There was a business center ($3 for 15 minutes) with a printer. In-room safes, ironing board, and hair dryer were also included.\r\nWhile this part of midtown is not my favorite part of town (seems a bit lacking in character), the location was convenient. It was across 7th Avenue from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station for people who take the train from Newark or JFK. Three different subway lines were within a 2 block walk. Macy\'s and Koreatown on 32nd Street were just a few blocks away. This was my first trip to NYC where I never used a cab because the train station and subways were so close. Also, Starbucks and Cafe Europa are across the street for coffe though I found I just used the coffee maker in my room.\r\nSome people have mentioned steet noise. Seventh Avenue is a busy street and, as with many city hotels, rooms with views often mean hearing more noise. I had a horrible view of the adjacent buildings from room 517, but it was much quieter than being on the front of the building.\r\nThe only negatives were the climate control. I don\'t think that the room temps were individually controlled. I was never cold or hot, but once or twice I wanted to briefly turn up the heat to take the chill off. The other negative is that the bathroom was the smallest I\'ve ever seen. The open floor space was about 3 feet x 3 feet so that you could sit on the toilet, brush your teeth at the sink, and wash your feet in the shower at the same time. The stall shower was like showering in a phone booth and because it was so small it was hard to find a dry area to lather in. I\'m a petite woman and I found that it was hard to not touch either the shower wall or the shower curtain. This was a minor annoyance for me, but could be a problem for a larger person.'
5,'Awesome location; lovely staff','I\'ve just arrived home from a one week whirlwind first visit to New York. The Affinia Manhattan was a perfect location. Situated on 7th Ave opposite Madison Square Garden. Within walking distance of most sights - Times Square, just a few minutes to Empire State Building, 2 minutes to Macy\'s, a 30 minute walk to Central park. My sister and I had a twin bedded room. We\'d been warned it could be a little noisy at night by hey, this is New York, we weren\'t expecting burbling brooks and birdsong! Take earplugs if you\'re worried about sleep. To be honest the traffic didn\'t bother me. The hotel was clean and tidy. The maid service was good. The concierge and reception staff were really friendly - going out of their way to help (when our luggage was delayed 30 hours) and to remember little tidbits about us. There\'s a great cafe called Bagel Maven Cafe over the road with fantastic bagels for breakfast. We just loved it. We\'d definitely stay there again!'
5,'Apartment living','This is my second visit to the Affinia Manhattan. When I stayed there last December the room I shared with my sister was beautiful but small. \r\nThis time I was travelling with my husbnd, our 12 year old son and 17 year old daughter. The room/apartmewe were allocated this time was amazing. It was on the top (28th) floor. Still a but noisy, but hey, this is New York!\r\nWhen we arrived at the hotel it was 9pm and in our room they had put all the lamps and the TV on which was lovely as it meant we didn’t go into a dark room. They had also left a box of cupcakes to welcome us!\r\nThe room was OUTSTANDING – like an apartment – big bedroom with 2 queen/king beds. Miss 17 decided to sleep in the fold out couch in the living room. That room was big with a sofa, 2 comfy chairs, a dining table and chairs, a study desk and chair; also a small kitchen (not that we cooked) but the empty fridge was used a lot. There were 2 bathrooms – one average sized hotel bathroom and one large bathroom with a full sized bath that you could lie down in(how often do you get that in a hotel?).\r\nWi-fi was $69.95 per week per device but they took pity on us and our 6 devices and told us they would only charge us for one device. When we checked out they said since we’d stayed a week it would all be complimentary. No charge.\r\nWe just loved it. A 10 minute walk to Times Square and, even better, 2 small blocks to Macy\'s. We loved it.'
5,'Letti da favola','Hotel in zona centrale\r\nServizio cortese e veloce:riparazione del condizionatore d\'aria fatta in 2 minuti.\r\nNon ho mai dormito così bene nella mia vita detto anche da mia figlia.\r\nStanza molto ampia e comoda,pulizia oculata,Ho già soggiornato nel 2006 e ci tornerò anche l\'anno prossimo,\r\nL\'angolo cucina è eccellente e comodo per chi vuole risparmiare\r\nPotrebbe sembrare un pò caro ma bisogna programmare il soggiorno nelle date più convenienti.\r\nne vale la pena.\r\nBuone vacanze'
4,'si dorme da nababbi','camere molto grandi e comode\r\nletti eccezionali dove si dorme veramente comodi\r\nservizio rapido (per un guasto al condizionatore sono arrivati subito e riparato in un minuto)\r\ncucina completa di accessori veramente utile (se lasci delle stoviglie sporche le ritrovi la mattina pulite)\r\nstruttura bella classica ma un pò datata\r\nprogrammare le date del soggiorno più convenienti'
5,'Loved the Affinia AND its Manager','Booked my stay at the Affinia Manhattan many months ago. Since there are so many different room layouts, I asked to speak to the Manager for specific wants and needs. The General Manager, Steven Kipness, answered my E-mail within MINUTES with the information and assurances I needed. He personally made sure everything, including choice of room, were what I needed. We stayed for 6 days and his assistance made them the quintessential New York experience. Every one of the service people went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. EVERYTHING was perfect! If you have any problems or questions at all, I highly recommend that you speak to him. \r\nThe Hotel is lovely with beautiful, large suites and great service. The restaurant downstairs was excellent . \r\n To put it mildly, I highly recommend the Affinia Manhattan!\r\nJoan Goldstein'
5,'Affinia Manhatten, Best Location, Best Service','From booking the trip itself, to the front desk employees, to the behind the scenes employees, to Niles, the House Restaurant, there was COMPLETE satisfaction. MARY PEREZ, helped with a particularly tough reservation with very necessary needs with a capable and affable attitude. Nothing was too much for her to do for us, and always with a smile. If you have any kind of an unusual or difficult problem, ask for her, and I can almost guarantee it will be solved. Carl, the Bellman, is always there to help out and give really excellent tips in any situation. That they have been long-time employees of the Affinia speaks to how capable and accommodating they are. I have had personal contact with the Manager, Steven Kipness, and he too is always going out of his way to make sure the guests are happy and have everything they need. It was a difficult year for the Affinia due to ongoing construction but any inconvenience to the guests was less than minimal. The construction should be completed shortly and I will look forward to seeing a rejuvenated Affinia the next time I am in NYC.\r\nJoan Goldstein'
5,'This place is nearly perfect!','You have to try this place the new rooms are spacious and nicely designed and clean as as can be. Bathrooms are small but all you do is clean and go you don\'t sleep there. The gym is nice too, pretty update equipment. The staff is so nice and service is paramount. We ran into Paul Fratta this man was every where greeting us with smiles and making us feel like family, we will be back.'
5,'A great stay with great service','I had in issue with the noise from the workers outside the building and I ran into Paul in the corridor and I asked him how or can I get another room? Well this man’s actions made my stay. He politely asked if he may enter to call the desk for another room. Within seconds he got another room and off we went he carried my bags and everything! The only issue was the next room had no view or couch like I reserved. Well Paul quickly reassured me he would continue to get my rooming issue resolved. On the phone again he found a third room, before I could even try to pick up a bag Paul had them all again!! Finally, success the room was quiet and clean the only issue was the bathroom. It did need renovating compared to the sleeping and living room. After our adventure of visiting three rooms was over. I was settled in as Paul put my bags down and he gave me his card and I was more astonished. He was the Director of the Housekeeping department!!!! I have traveled all over the world and have never experienced such personal care from someone of this level. Thanks and Kudos to Paul I will be back due to your kind and professional care.'
5,'Beautiful rooms, great location and friendly staff','Perfect location. Beautiful clean, modern rooms. Great staff working hard to make your stay great ! This is my third stay with family. I will always return here.'
5,Concierge,'It was great to have Norva B. tell us the best way to get somewhere or recommend a fun place to eat at.\r\nThank you ! We love the Affinia Manhattan Hotel and it\'s friendly staff ! We will be back !'
4,'Affinia: Many Positives, one negative','Booked this hotel via Travelzoo, and after reading the reviews here at Tripadvisor. As others have stated....GREAT location, and very friendly service. We originally booked a studio suite w/ 2 beds, and after contacting the hotel with some concerns/questions, we were upgraded to a 1BR deluxe suite. It was HUGE! The bedroom had 2 queen beds, wth an array of pillows. Yes, the bathrooms are small, but adequate, and the Aveeda products are a nice touch. We had a fairly large living room w/ sleeper sofa and large chair, huge desk/chair, and TV. However, being that we were in NYC for a conference and some sightseeing, we didn\'t spend much time in our room. The kitchen area was larger than expected....and it was nice to have a fridge to store water and some snacks. \r\nThe staff at the Affinia were the friendliest I have encountered. My initial contact with the front desk and concierge was to inquire about a high floor room...and ask about shopping in the area. After being reassured that they would put together a packet of information for when we arrived, I sent off an email to Amy, the customer care manager, telling her how pleased I was with the service...and our stay hadn\'t even ocurred yet. In reply, she gave us a complimentary upgrade. \r\nThe location is so convenient....caught the subway across the street each day. Also had dinner in Tracks restaurant in Penn Staion, (near the LIRR ticket booth). Excellent meal, and cheap by NYC standards. Two of us ate for $30, including tip. My sister enjoyed the nearby shopping of Macy\'s and Old Navy (while I attended my conference). Nearby Tick Tock Diner (34th & 8th) was an excellent choice for breakfast...again, not expensive and great food. I liked the security in the evening, checking our hotel key before being allowed to access the elevators. \r\nThe only downside is, as most others have reported, the noise level. I have stayed in NYC on many other occasions, and am used to some noise....but even from our suite on the 24th floor, the streetnoise----cars honking, fire trucks, church bells ringing, etc., sounded as if it was right outside our window. It was not blocked at all. I am a light sleeper.....and despite the comfy bed and pillows (oh, the pillow menu is fantastic!), I didn\'t really get a good night\'s sleep. Next time, I will request an interior room, if that is possilbe. Yes, I know we could\'ve requested a room change...but we had unpacked, and just didn\'t want the hassle of moving everything. With all the other positives of the Affinia, the noise wasn\'t a huge problem. And....we now know better for next time.'
5,'Another great stay at the Affinia Manhattan','This was probably my 5th stay at the Affinia, (which is my favorite hotel in NYC). This time, we had a 1BR unit for a week, (split the stay w/ friends). While I loved the old rooms, the renovations are awesome! My daughter couldn\'t believe the difference in decor from last year\'s stay. I traveled with my two children, ages 16 and 14, and there was plenty of room in the unit for all of us. (My friend who went up the 2nd half of the week had 4 in her party--2 adults, 2 children, and also remarked how roomy the unit was.) The bed was very comfortable, and as always, the pillow menu was much appreciated. One of our favorite perks of the Affinia is choosing our pillows. The kids appreciated the modern flat screen TVs mounted on the wall of both bedroom and living area. We had unit 1931, and while the kitchen area was smaller than other rooms I\'ve stayed in at the Affinia, it was fine for our needs. Coffeemaker, (coffee packets replenished daily), fridge w/ plenty of space for drinks, fresh fruit and leftovers, microwave oven (drawer type, used for reheating of leftovers), and place setting for 4. A toaster would\'ve been useful, but we made do without it. The Affinia makes use of every available space for storage: closet in bedroom had quite a few hangers, plus a small chest of drawers squeezed in there. The bathroom was very tiny, tub/shower combo, but adequate. Again, storage space under the bathroom sink: shelves & drawers, and plenty of towels. Love the fact that we don\'t have to bring shampoo and other beauty products---again, replenished daily. Pull out couch as comfy and roomy. Two additonal comfortable chairs and small table in living area gave us plenty of room to relax. Desk area was large, with plenty of outlets. My only complaint, (like quite a few posters here on TripAdvisor), is the high charge for internet access......$14.95 is way too expensive. We use the internet to search out activities & restaurants....and tried to limit our usage.\r\nThe location can\'t be beat.....easy access to buses and subway, as well as easy walk to Times Square area. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.....especially when I explained that I would be splitting our week stay w/ friends. We love the Affinia, (having first stayed here several years ago for a teaching conference....find great deals on travelzoo.com). This stay was actually arranged via RCI timeshare, which made it an even better deal. I always recommend the Affinia to my friends, family and colleagues who want to visit NYC.'
5,'This stay tops them all.','When my daughter wanted to look at colleges in New York City, I knew we\'d have to stay at the Affinia Manhattan. By booking on their website, you have several choices of special offers, many of which make the choice very affordable. We had a studio room with two beds and kitchen/table area and a terrace.......for $199/night. INCREDIBLE!!!! The room was spacious, clean, and everything in working order. We were on a higher floor, (21, I believe), so noise was not an issue. Regardless....you are in a major metropolitan city.....get used to noise!!!! yes, the bathroom is small...but they make such good use of the limited space. Water pressure in the shower was good, towels were fluffy, toiletry items much appreciated. The beds were very comfortable, and we love the choice of pillow menu. Air conditioner work fine---room was quite cool, which was needed, as the outside temperature was in the 90\'s. Due to the excessive heat, we did not use the terrace, which had a table and 2 chairs, along with a nice view of surrounding buildings/skyscrapers. The kitchen area was compact, but again, all we needed was the fridge to store drinks and leftovers, microwave to heat things up, and the coffee maker. Elevators were all working, and waits for non-existent.\r\nHow can previous reviewers say there is nothing in this area to visit, nor good restaurants???? C\'mon people, explore the neighborhood! Not everything has to be the Times Square bright lights. We walked several blocks to the High Line and followed that to the Chelsea Market. Great place to try a variety of food: crepes, seafood, sushi, italian, ice cream, desserts, etc. Within a few blocks of the hotel, we found Asian Fusion restaurant.....3 course meal w/ bottle of wine for $39 thanks to Living Social. Great food & service. Love the breakfast at Tick Tock Diner. Being across from Penn Station is so convenient.....took trains uptown to Columbia University, Yankee Stadium and theaters; downtown to Canal Street and 9/11 Memorial. You just can\'t beat the location of the Affinia. I tell everyoe about this hotel, and will continue to do so. Hope to return soon.'
4,'Godt hotel!','Fantastisk hotel, men meget gammelt, men næsten alle hoteller i New York ser gamle ud fordi byen er så gammel, set bort fra det var det et fantastisk sted'
5,Fantastisk!,'Fedeste hotel ever... Vi havde en konge suite med udsigt udover hele manhattan. Man sov godt og følte sig tryg ved at være på dette hotel. Dette kan anbefales til familier med børn. Det ligger meget centralt i New York og kun 300 meter væk fra Times Square og hvis du vil ned til ground Zero skal du nok hoppe ind i en gul taxi... :D'
5,'Best hotel in Manhattan','The Affina rooms all come with a small kitchen and the larger suites have an extra room with a sofa bed and an extra bathroom. Carl, the bellman, takes a personal interest in all the guest, insuring their stay is perfect. Margaret and Amanda in Guest Services are effiecient, professional, beautiful, and very helpful with the process of checking in and making sure everything is perfect.\r\nThe only think I don\'t like is that they charge for internet service. Internet is free (or worked into the price of the room) in a lot of hotels.\r\nStill, it\'s a small price to pay for such a great on the road experience.'
5,'excellent stay in NY','Great rooms, great beds, great location. And great staff (Carl, in particular, was very helpful in getting us in and out), but thanks to all.'
4,'Excellent stay. Any issues were minor','We stayed for 3 nights, late March. We stayed on the 14th floor in a newly renovated suite which, from the other reviews, seems to make all the difference in the world. The room was immaculate. the beds were brand new. Everything was clean, comfortable, and quiet. (street noise excepted).\r\nStaff was great. Check in was easy. Elevators were plentiful and fast. Rooms were secure. Bell staff was professional and very courteous. \r\nTo deal with the street noise, we simply turned on the fans and put in ear plugs. Perfect night\'s sleep. \r\nDownsides: the kitchen is not really equipped for cooking but fine for small supplies of groceries. The bathrooms are very very small and towel racks/hooks seem to be non-existent. That\'s a minor issue, however. \r\nThe fitness center is standard fare and not adequate if you are a CrossFitter. w made it work. \r\nWe enjoyed it and would stay again, but would specifically request a top floor, newly renovated 2 BR suite.'
4,'Excellent Stay - a few hiccups.','Full-disclosure; I am still here in the middle of my stay but have a few moments to weigh in so far. \r\nI have seen a few of the reviews that have complained of either run-down or dirty issues - I simply cannot agree. I have been very pleased with the condition of the hotel in general (see hiccups below) meaning, this place is neat, clean, and well appointed. \r\nStaff service, especially the front desk and bell staff, have been remarkable. The front desk staff has been professional, efficient and very helpful. \r\nElevators are fast and plentiful, clean and safe. Hallways are clean and modern and free of that occasional debris that you sometimes run into, an errant tissue or napkin that seems to sit there for days. \r\nAnd, I have not seen one single critter, which is important to me being somewhat of a phobic. Not an ant, not a roach, not a bedbug, not a gnat, not a fly. Weird to mention, perhaps, but I have stayed in places where this has been an issue. This place is clean, no question. \r\nLocation is perfect. This is 7th ave across from Madison Sq. Garden. Starbucks, pizza, desserts, subway entrance, all within half a block. No better place to be. \r\nNoise? It\'s NYC. First, there is almost ZERO noise from other rooms, or voices in the hall, doors slamming or toilets flushing. None. \r\nStreet noise can be eliminated with a decent pair of ear plugs. Not the foam ones, the wax ones. Use them properly and you will hear NOTHING. \r\nNow, the hiccups. \r\nWhen the bell man dropped off the bags, he asked if there was anything else we needed; I stated that we needed more coffee packets. He happily stated that I will send them right up. This never happened. (more on this bellman in a second)\r\nSecondly, when we moved in, the AC unit in the room was extremely noisy. To the point where it needed to be dealt with. I called the desk, they sent maintenance up immediately, all good. He looked at it and said the compressor was bad, he needed to locate another one. I assumed it meant he would go find a unit and bring it up and swap it out. He disappeared and we never heard back. No follow up, no nothing. So we\'re using the fan on the unit which is keeping the room moderately cool but can\'t actually turn on the AC or the noise actually produces nausea. \r\nSo from a service standpoint, there\'s a bit of a follow up issue. Not major, just frustrating enough. Housekeeping has been spotty (last night they showed up at 8:30 pm looking to service the room - a bit late, dont you think?) but overall, these are the things that happen. \r\nOne of the most unusual things is a particular bell man - not sure the name but this guy is bringing the professionalism level of the hotel down a bit. He is the same guy who promised up the coffee packets - and I think he just pocketed the tip and went away. I dont think he really cared whether we got the coffee. \r\nWhen we checked in, this same bell man was acting a bit unusual with the front desk staff - demanding high - fives from a couple of the girls - and the girl who checked us is was visibly uncomfortable with this. This is not really a professional display to exhibit in front of the guests. \r\nThis same guy ended up in an elevator with me, my daughter and another family. At that point he started handing out business cards for a local Irish pub and a Liquor store saying this is the place to go...clearly, he\'s getting some kick backs from these places to promote them but it\'s highly unprofessional, especially when the business cards for a liquor store are being handed out to kids. \r\nnow, is this the Affinia\'s fault? Not really, this guy is just a typical rouge new york hustler trying to earn a buck. but as I said, it\'s taking the polish off the professional sheen of the hotel. \r\nWould I stay here again? Absolutely. They have treated us pretty well, given us a room upgrade, and I am getting some great sleep. Just a few hiccups and this would be a perfect 5 stars.'
5,'Great Location, great beds.','We booked this hotel after reading about it on Tripadvisor and never having been to New York before we did not know what to expect. It turned out to be a gem, great location, right in the middle of all the action. As said before, after a long trip, the bed was heaven 6 foot wide and really comfortable. The room was very big and we even had the kitchen area which came with a cooker, fridge, microwave and utensiles. We were at the back and think it was a better room than being near the front as the noise is 24hour. Food is no problem in NY and Macy,s is a couple of blocks away. also Penn station across the road will take you direct to Newark airport for approx $15, saving a fortune on taxis.\r\nWe recommend this hotel to anyone on a first trip, a great experience.'
4,'2nd Vist to Affinia, Manhattan','This was our second visit to New York and we especially asked for this hotel mainly because of the location but were pleasantly surprised by the new decor of the bedroom we were given.It was very fresh and the bathroom was completely refurbished. O.K. maybe a little small but it was in the centre of Manhattan, also the beds were really great . All the staff were very helpful and the foyer was spacious and ideal for waiting for transport pickup with generous sofas. \r\nWe did not use the resturant but because of the central location, eating out was no problem.\r\nA great stay and would use again.'
4,'tolles Hotel in zentraler Lage','Ich war nun bereits das dritte Mal in diesem Hotel und ich würde jederzeit wieder dort einchecken. Mittlerweile wird das gesamte Hotel renoviert und die neuen Zimmer sind toll. Ich würde jedem eine One-Bedroom Suite empfehlen, da diese sehr komfortabel und mit voll ausgestatteter Küche ist! Dieses Mal hatten wir ein zu kleines Zimmer reserviert, es war jedoch kein Problem ein größeres Zimmer zu erhalten! Die Lage ist fast nicht zu bezahlen, gegenüber Penn Station und Madison Square Garden. Drei Blocks weiter Macy\'s usw.... Also, wer gut in NY übernachten will - mein Tipp Affinia Manhattan'
5,'immer wieder gern','Dies war nun mein vierter Besuch im Affinia Manhattan. Daran erkennt man wohl auch, dass es mir dort gut gefällt. Die Zimmer sind einfach schön und für New Yorker Verhältnisse groß. Dieses Mal hatten meine Tochter und ich eine Studio Suite mit zwei Queensize Betten. Die Küchenzeile ist super eingerichtet. Man kann sich auch mal was kochen (aber wer hat in NY Lust dazu, wo es doch an jeder Ecke ein tolles Restaurant bzw. Diner gibt). Die Betten sind bequem, der Service im Hotel ist auch immernoch super. Ich würde jederzeit wieder in dieses Hotel gehen, da die Lage perfekt ist. Times Square in 10 min zu Fuß zu erreichen, Empire State Building in 5 min., Macys in 4 Min. Alles in allem ein tolles Hotel und nur zu empfehlen!'
5,'Excellent choice','My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on 04/22-04/29, celebrating our wedding anniversary. We booked through Travel-ticker and got a great average rate of $134, for a studio with a king size bed. We arrived at JFK and took the Airtrain to Jamaica and the LIRR to Penn Station, and were in the hotel in no time and it was very cheap. Check-in was quick and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We got a really nice room on the 20th floor, with a balcony overlooking Penn Station/MSG. The room was spotless. It had a nice sized closet with plenty of room for clothes and shopping bags, with an iron and iron-board and safety box. The room also had a working desk with an office chair plus another arm chair. There was also a 6-drawer dresser, 2 nightstands, and a kitchenette with microwave, stove and a small fridge. The location can\'t be beat, just across from Penn Station so we used the subway every day. Macy\'s and 34th street shopping is only 3 blocks away and Times Sqaure only one subway station away. We would definitely go back and we would recommend it to others.'
4,'Again the best option','My family and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on 04/25-29 as part of a 2 week family vacation along the East Coast. It was our second time there, as my husband and I stayed there 2 years ago and loved it, so we decided we definitely wanted to stay there again. After searching for some time, we finally found a rate according to our budget and we booked through the hotel\'s website and got a great rate of $179 for a studio with 2 double beds. We arrived to Penn Station from Philadelphia by Amtrak, and with kids and luggage it was wonderful to just be able to step outside Penn, cross the street, and we were already in the hotel. Check-in was quick and, eventhough it was noon, we got a room immediately and our request of a room near the elevator (easier with kids) was fulfilled. We got an accesible room on the 13th floor, which was very big and was a plus with family, but unfortunately the furniture was looking old and the rug could\'ve been more clean. It had 2 vertical closets and in the middle of both it had a good size working desk with an office chair which was very handy. There was also a great kitchenette with microwave, toaster, utensils, stove and a small fridge which was perfect to keep breakfast items for the kids. You can go to K Mart next to Penn Station and they have a small supermarket downstairs, and we found better prices than at local delis. The location can\'t be beat, just across from Penn Station, and so we used the subway every day. Macy\'s and 34th street shopping is only 3 blocks away and Times Square only one subway station away. Eventhough the room didn\'t quite meet our expectations, as far as furniture and cleanliness (only the rug), we had a great stay, would definitely go back and would recommend it to others. Especially now that I know that the rooms are being renovated, the Affinia Manhattan is a great option and hopefully we will go back again.'
5,'Loved this Hotel','We found the hotel to be very clean and spacious. The concierge was very helpful in assisting us with restraint reservation and Broadway tickets. The beds were incredibly comfortable. We did stay on the 28th floor, so city noise was not the problem. We were within walking distance of Times Square and many other attractions. We could not have enjoyed ourselves more and are looking forward to our next visit to New York and our next stay at the Affinia Manhattan.'
4,'Quiet in the City','We spent six nights at this hotel. The hotel is located in a quiet part of New York City. We could not hear any of the other guests nor was the traffic a problem. We chose a room with a balcony, however I would not recommend spending the extra money on the balcony because the views are not very good. The room was large and very comfortable. It had a small kitchen which allowed us to eat a couple of our meals in our room. However, there were no pans for cooking and no paper towels. If you need these you will have to ask for them. We used the microwave, frig and the sink and made use of their cups, plates and utensils. All employees were very kind and helpful. Anytime we asked for something such as extra towels and hangers, the items were brought to us quickly and we never had to ask more than once. We will stay here again the next time we are in New York.'
3,'Excellent location, shame about the room','We stayed here for our honeymoon and after looking at their impressive website decided that this was the place for us. We booked room only as we were planning to see relatives as well as all the usual sights. Despite the pretty lobby and friendly staff I was needless to say that I was very disappointed with the room. It was small, and quite tatty the carpet had seen better days as had the decor. Whilst I appreciate we hadnt booked a suite or a \'posher\' room I was disappointed that I spent all that money on a very very basic room. You are quite simply paying for the location. I would go back to the hotel however I would recommend booking a better room than we had.'
3,'Fabulous location','We stayed there for our honeymoon in August 2009. On arriving we were amazed by the reception area, it was spectacular. However, we were disappointed by the rooms, extremely basic, no amenities apart from a bed, tv, safe and bathroom. Would have been nice to have a fridge\r\nGood points: fabulous location, opposite Madison Square Gardens, good bar next door, helpful conceirge\r\nBad Points: You get what you pay for, no little extras or special things, especially as they knew it was our honeymoon. The phone costs a fortune, we made 3 calls to England,which were short calls and got a bill for $44. Breakfasts were expensive, Eggs Benedict cost up $34. We ended going to McDonalds every morning for breakfast (not exactly very healthy but certainally the cheaper option!)'
4,'Great Value, Location for Family of 5','Hard to find rooms for family of 5 in NYC. Glad I listened to reviews as this hotel was perfect for our family getaway. Stayed here June 25th- 30th in 1 bdrm deluxe and will definitely stay again. Arrived via Amtrak train at Penn Stn, across the street. Easy access to subway. Very large rooms - with 3 teen boys, good to have space. Frig very handy for cold drinks, etc. Very clean, well-kept rooms - liked that we could open windows, nice breeze. Easy walk to Times Square, Broadway. Concierge very helpful. Recommended Tick Tock diner for quick breakfast, Antique Cafe for more leisurely one. Look forward to returning!'
5,'Another great vacation at this hotel','We stayed here for 3 nights in early August. As there are 5 in our family, the one bdrm deluxe with 2 bathrooms was perfect! Across from Penn Station, so ideal if you Amtrak it in or take subway. Macy\'s up the street and within walking distance to Times Square. Our room wasn\'t quite ready when we checked in so they provided us with complimentary cocktails & appetizers at Niles Restaurant next door. Which was welcome treat after long train ride! And they had our luggage delivered to our room & various other extras were appreciated. \r\nWould definitely stay here again.'
5,'Very nice just like pictured on website','Very nice clean room, good size for NY. Decor and hotel matches website of hotel exactly. Will be happy to return again. Very close to Penn Station.'
2,'Bait and switch … Stay someplace else!','Booked my room in Jan for a stay in late June, booked a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms. This layout was important to me so I called and confirmed my online reservation just to make sure I had book a two bedroom two bath room. On check in day I stopped by the front desk at 11:30am, the room was not ready, which was fine check in was at 3PM… confirmed at 11:30 I had a two bath/ two bedroom suite waiting for me. Stopped back at 2:30PM room still was not ready but I thought I would give it a try again, confirmed still waiting for a two bedroom two bath suite, at that time was offered a one bedroom suite that had two bathrooms if I wanted that, I opted to wait for my room. 3PM rolls around and I find out that I don’t have a two bedroom / two bath suite but a two bedroom one bath suite. I asked for the room I had been promised and was told I could take what you are being given or leave it, and bathrooms are not guaranteed They gave me $100 for my trouble… Further trouble on our stay included three room keys that stopped working. Stained bathroom towel and clearly air conditioner filters that have never been cleaned.'
4,'Wonderful hotel...','This was my first stay at the Affinia and I was a little apprehensive at first. However, I was very impressed with the upgraded rooms and friendly staff. The room had all the amenities I needed for work and I loved the LCD TV and pillows! The only disappointment was the shower. It was incredibly small and only had one tiny shelf to put my soap, shampoo, shaving cream, etc. The room was very clean and room service was good. The location, right across from MSG, was perfect for my purposes.'
5,'Great Hotel!','Wonderful hotel with a very attentive staff. Check is was smooth efficient. The room was great. It had a small kitchen with a refrig., cooktop, microwave, etc., a living room with flat screen TV and a large bedroom with a 2nd flat screen TV. Ordered room service and the meal was delivered within 15 min. The room was very clean - especially the bathroom. \r\nYou have to try the \'Pillow Menu\' once you get to the room. It\'s very unique!\r\nWould definitely return!'
5,'Most Central Place','Fantastic!!! Went here with my mother on the 28th March and stayed for a week. It was my first time in NY and I have to say the location was bang on. My friend and her mother stayed here for a couple nites with us too. The room that my mam and I had was big (very big) by NY standards. We had a little kitchette and ensuite also and a big closet. We were 11 floors up and our room looked out on 7th Ave. I am going back and I will def stay here. It is just so central. We stayed on a bed only basis but had breakfast in the hotel on our last morning and talk about a choice for breakfast. The bar was always a hub of activity in the evening. very close to Macys - 3 minutes walk. Highly recommend.'
5,'Even better than our 1st stay there!','Stayed here in February with my baby daughter, mam and 2 sisters. Had 2 studio rooms side by side and I have to say the rooms were great. So spacious. Had the cot in one. 2 Double beds in each. A home from home and only 7 or 8 mins walk to Times Sq. We walked almost everywhere and only got a taxi the day we went to the airport. Otherwise we used the bus or metro. So handy. Definiately coming back here again. The hotel is in just a great location. It was really cold while we were in NY though. We stayed here for 8 nights and it was so comfortable. The fridge and kitchen facilities were handy for travellin with the baby.'
5,'Great experience!','This is not a good hotel it is a great hotel! Stayed with my new husband 27th oct to 1st nov 2007. (Also stayed here with my sis same time last year when buying my wedding dress in Macy\'s!) Got a fair price from otel.com of 1580 euro for a five night stay. Had requested a room with a view on a high floor before arrival. (Yes it is a little noisy but it is New York after all and as it says on the tin - it\'s the city that never sleeps!) \r\nCheck in was super smooth with the very friendly Michelle and when she heard we were on honeymoon she went to the room plan folder to ensure we had the best room available. \r\nWe were more than pleased with our corner suite located on the 25th floor which had a classic New York skyline looking uptown towards Broadway and T Square. Lots of space and two bathrooms with two showers which got us out faster in th mornings! We were just in the door of room when a complintmentary bottle of wine was delivered to the room.Nice touch! Beds are super comfy and housekeeping is of a very high standard.Decor is fine if a little bland.I wasn\'t in New York to admire the wallpaper! Cocktails are very morish and room service is prompt and friendly. I will certainly return!'
5,'Fabulous Refurb !','Just love this hotel. Great staff , reasonable prices ( for New York), great location and gorgeous newly decorated rooms. Lovely fresh interior design which is quite funky. The Affinia Manhattan will always be my hotel of choice in Manhattan.'
4,'absolutely fine and will stay there again.','this is accross the street from Penn Station - convenient and easy. The staff were unbelieveably friendly and helpful and this is much appreciated. The room was as described and I was very pleased with it. No Complaints !'
4,'second time and still pleased.','This is a very convenient hotel - location is across the street from Penn Station. I took a room with a double bed and a pull out sofa. there was also a kitchennette and a fully equipped bathroom. The best part of the hotel - the staff us unbelieveably friendly, warm and polite. It is nice to be treated so well.'
5,'Great Business Hotel','I have been staying at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel for business purposes a number of years and it is the best! It is an excellent location in Midtown Manhattan and is right near Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and many fine restaurants to take clients for breakfast or lunch meetings. What I like best about the Hotel is its staff who make you feel right at home and are very professional and friendly in treating you as a Special Guest. I recommend it highly for business and tourist travelers.\r\n Richard J. Polsinello, President of Labor & Monitoring Consultants,LLC'
5,'Fun Time for Grandkids','This past week I stayed once again at the Affinia Manhattan for business purposes, my favorite Hotel in New York City. I invited my 3 grandkids down with their Mom & Dad to stay with me at the Hotel for a couple of days to see the sights e.g. Radio City Music Show, Christmas Tree, the Holiday displays in Macy\'s and other store windows, ice skating at Rockefeller Center,etc. What a Great time they had but most enjoyable was the Hotel staff on how they treated my Daughter, Son-in-law and my grandkids. They made them feel special and the Hotel location is close to all the attractions during the Holidays. I highly recommend the Affinia as the place to stay for business or personal vacations in the City. Richard J. Polsinello'
5,'Unbelievable kindness when you need help','My wallet was stolen in Penn Station after checking out. Having no cash, no ID, I came back to the hotel to ask if I could stay over 1 more night. When you have a problem, you want family / friends around. The staff at the Affinia were truly my family. Helping me find credit card phone numbers, airline numbers, providing me with a gift certificate to go out to eat, finding in the morning that they eliminated the 800 call fees which I had called for the cancellations, and the hugs and offers for additional help made the absolute best of a nightmare experience. There is no question I will stay with \'my family\' whenever I come to New York. How refreshing to find someone that doesn\'t start out reciting \'policy\' but rather looks at the situation and thinks on their own with understanding, care and compassion. You won\'t find a better staff in New York...I haven\'t found a better staff across the country. Kudos to GM Steve and his amazing staff.'
5,'The WOW experience','My sister has not been well and her dream has always been to go to New York. My kids flew in from the west coast and my sister and I flew in and we had a New York MInute. Having stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in the past, it was a wonderful experience to be able to call and have them remember you! Asking if it was business or pleasure, they made sure our trip was a WOW experience for my sister. \r\nWe had asked for a suite type room that would accomodate all of us, and were given a beautiful room with a patio overlooking the city. On a warm summer night, what more could you ask for for a sister t see NY for her first time and be able to experience the city that never sleeps from the patio! And to top it off, Amanda sent up a bottle of wine to celebrate the moment. \r\nThat\'s what makes this place stand out from other hotels. They don\'t just give you a room. Steve and the staff...from Van who greets you at the front door, to Margaret at the desk, to Amanda who works with groups, to Curtis who checks your bags, to Steve the GM, to every person that greets you...they want to create a WOW experience for you. They treat you as friends into their home. \r\nBeautiful room, beautiful people, beautiful experience = tremendous time. Thank you Affinia Manhattan! So good to know there are still places out there that really do care about the customer!'
5,'Why would anyone stay anywhere else??','My husband and I stayed in this hotel on the occasion of our 25th wedding anniversary. We did so with some trepidation as we had read some worrying reviews before we went. How wrong could they be??? Upon arrival, we were wished a happy anniversary by the reception staff and within minutes, on our way up to the 27th floor. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was amazing. We had two bathrooms, a sitting room area and kitchen complete with fridge etc. The bedroom had the largest bed I ever saw!!! Complimentary bottle of wine with chocolates wishing us a happy anniversay and note to that effect from the hotel. Tell me where anyone would get service like that in NY??? \r\nThis hotel is exceptional in its can do attitude to its customers. Not once did we feel like just another guest. All the staff have a way of making one feel like they are the only person within their radar of responsibility, clearly not the case but that\'s how it felt at all times. Price wise this hotel cannot be touched but that\'s not what will bring me back, its the ambiance, the service, the helpfulness of all staff( especially Maureen in concierge, wonderful, friendly and helpful!!) This hotel in no small way contributed to what was an amazing and memoriable trip. Take a bow Affinia Manhattan, you are in a league of your own. Well done.'
4,'return visit','They say one should never try to recapture a moment in time; this was certainly the case with our return visit to the Affinia Hotel. Last year we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and this year my husband\'s 50th birthday. The Affinia very kindly gave us one of their new revamped rooms but I must say I preferred the rooms the way they were!!! Minimalist style does nothing for me at all. The staff are very kind but I do feel that this hotel could do better in terms of customer service, why charge for internet??? (And at triple the price of anyone else close by who are supplying it) As a traveller this mattered to me and could be the reason I will pick another hotel if I go back to NY. Housekeeping is a bit slap/dash too, some days we got toiletries and others none at all. I feel this hotel could do better in small ways and it needs someone hands on to make that happen. May or may not return, overall ok at best.'
5,'Always try to stay at the Southgate','This apartment hotel is right across from Penn Station. As former New Yorkers, we visit at least once a year, usually for at least a week. Despite the near-Times Square location, we feel safe and comfortable. Someone\'s always watching who goes up the elevators, and even a woman alone feels well taken care of. The beds are unusually comfortable - firm but not hard - and there\'s a choice of many types of pillows. The air-conditioning is powerful, and individual units are in each apartment. Everything works well, the staff cleans thoroughly, and any problems are quickly resolved (need more coffee packets, that sort of thing). Cabs are easily found at the door, and subway and bus-lines are right there. There\'s even a Starbucks across the street for us caffeine freaks! And a Whole Foods market (natural food store) is nearby (a few blocks downtown). \r\nA piece of advice - if coming during a popular season, such as Christmas, the Jewish Holidays, or Easter, book LOOONG in advance, like 6 months, or it will be full.'
4,'A home away from home,g reat for Broadway shows and much more.','We\'ve stayed here as briefly as 2 nights and as long as 2 weeks. For train travelers it\'s the most convenient - right across the street from Penn Station, which is also a major subway center. For Broadway shows it\'s a short walk to most theatres. \r\nThe hotel itself, currently being unobtrusively renovated, offers studios, 1-bedrooms and 2-bedroom suites, all with kitchenettes which have a refrigerator, microwave, oven, stove, sink, dishes, flatware, and coffee maker. We requested a toaster - it appeared in 5 minutes. And that\'s an important aspect of this place - ask and thou shalt receive, pleasantly, promptly. We looked mildly disappointed when we checked in, being told our room had 2 doubles rather than a queen or king - instantly we were upgraded to a huge apartment with 3 (!) exposures, same price ($208), very reasonable for Manhattan. The beds and pillows are wonderful, by the way. The bathrooms are tiny, showers without tubs as far as we\'ve seen. Large LG flatscreen tvs, wifi, many outlets excwpt in the bathroom and kitchen (odd, this), room darkening shades, air conditioners. \r\nService is always great, many unobtrusive security people - safe for a woman alone. Many elevators. No restaurant - the room service comes from Niles - don\'t bother. Next door is a deli-type grocery, Starbucks across the street, and Penn Station has lots of food, a drugstore, etc.\r\nOnly negatives: heating is uneven - the windows leak air prodigeously - and the walls are plain beige - NO artwork in rooms.\r\nOne recommendation: Corner rooms are the best; don\'t choose a room on the elevator wall. All others are nice and quiet. If you want a nice view, just ask. We prefer quiet to a view, but we\'re old New Yorkers.'
4,'Brilliant Location','We stayed at Affinia Dumont at Christmas/New Year and adored it. However we decided it was a little bit \'out of the way\' - so when we returned in March we opted for the Affinia Manhattan. It was a bit confusing as I booked half my stay with 1800 hotels and the other half directly with the hotel - due to availability. The price difference was about $200 per night (1800hotels was $150 per night and directly it cost us $350). The hotel is brilliantly situated - directly across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It is so convenient for shopping (42nd St, Macys!!). There is also a good variety of restaurants around the area (mainly chain restaurants). The suite was large, clean and very well equipped. We did feel the room was very noisy (in comparison to Dumont). Well we were smack bang in the middle of NYC - so what did we expect??? The staff were nice. We did encounter a problem - casued by having to book the stay in 2 halves - which meant we were locked out of our room - due to a misunderstanding with reception. I felt overall the staff at the Dumont were nicer - especially the door staff. \r\nWe were very nervous beforehand as we heard the hotel was dirty and run down - this was not the case at all. We were very happy with our stay. You could not wish for a better location. We went to Mama Mia on Broadway and we walked back to the hotel in a few mintes - we were both females and we felt very safe in this neighbourhood even late at night.'
4,'Affinia Revisited','After a lovely stay at the Affinia Manhattan last year we decided to revisit this year. It was a girly holiday - off for a bit of shopping, some nice meals and some sight seeing. \r\nThis hotel is perfect location wise - across the road from Penn Station and MSG. It is so close to 42nd St for atmosphere, 5th Avenue for shopping and Broadway for shows. \r\nWe were generally pleased with the hotel again, albeit we were in a slightly more dated room with a tiny bathroom. We had 2 king sized beds - which were super comfy. We also had a kitchenette with coffeemaker/cooker/microwave etc. if we needed it.\r\nReception staff was very nice - very friendly and welcoming. We had problems with the intense heat of the room on our first night. We discovered the thermostats on the radiators didnt work - so it was not possible to control the heat. Reception sorted it out next day for us - so our second night was more comfortable.\r\nWe had a panic when we left the hotel as we were both covered in red welts. We immediately thought we had been bitten by bed bugs as we had read reviews of bed bugs in this hotel. We contacted Customer Services at the hotel who told us they had investigated the problem and called in an \'exterminator\' company who could find no evidence of bed bug infestation. They even sent us a copy of the certificate the supplied.\r\nWe are keeping our fingers crossed that this is accurate!!!!!'
4,'Large rooms, good staff','We stayed at this hotel because we got a fabulous deal through one of their occasional sales. Although we had a very pleasant stay, I doubt we would stay here at full price because it is easy to find cheaper rooms in a quieter neighborhood.\r\nOur train arrived at Penn Station mid-morning. This hotel is almost across the street from the station, and it is quite nice to be able to walk right to your hotel rather than wait for a cab. It was also great to have this location on our last day because it meant we could have a full day of fun before our 7:00 pm train without having to factor in time to retrieve our bags from a distant hotel. (We went to Brooklyn on our last day, so this was especially appreciated.)\r\nWe arrived at the hotel expecting to stow our bags. Instead, we got a room right away. The exact type of room we had requested wasn\'t available yet, but they offered us a choice of a couple of rooms that were ready, which I thought was great service. We chose a room with two beds on the 4th floor. When I saw the room we were given, I contacted the desk to verify the price. The room was BIG, and I mean that by any hotel standard, not just NYC standards. So big that I felt the need to make sure I would have no surprises at checkout! Besides the two beds, the room had a full couch, desk, dresser, and ottoman. There was no table, which we thought was odd since there certainly was room for one, and the room had a full kitchen.\r\nThe appliances in the kitchen, with the exception of the microwave, were definitely old. There was even some rust on the refrigerator. But everything was in working condition and very clean, so no complaints. And when was the last time you had a hotel room with an actual oven? There were some pots, pans and utensils, but not an entire array. For example, there was no colander, although I would think that pasta would be a pretty common quick dinner on the road.\r\nThe beds were comfortable and the bathroom was roomy and clean with good amenities. My main complaint was the difficulty in moderating the temperature in the room. The room was quite warm, and we could only turn the temperature down slightly. However, we have several friends who live in older high rises in the city, and this is a common problem, so I\'m not sure if there\'s much the hotel could do short of a major overhaul. The furnishings and decor were not particularly fancy - this is definitley an older building - but everything was clean.\r\nThe staff were all friendly and courteous. My son got a bad rash while we were there, and the staff quickly pointed us to a pharmacy that could help us. They also quickly pointed us to delis, grocery stores, and other common needs that can be difficult to find in this neighborhood. The concierge seemed to be helping a lot of people to get tickets to shows. The concierge staff didn\'t seem to have as much knowledge of the best ways to get to some of the far-flung sites we were trying to get to, but most people likely stay in this neighborhood for shows, shopping and the more standard tourist sites, so the concierge service is likely more than adequate for most guests. \r\nThe lobby is small, but has chandeliers and fancy elevator doors. My kids (ages 7 and 10) loved it, and felt as though they were royalty. They also loved the regular revolving door on the side entrance. The automatic revolving door at the main entrance moves very slowly, and they were naturally inclined to push, which only caused problems, so don\'t give in to that urge!'
4,'Decent renovation, but miss the old kitchens.','We have stayed at this hotel several times, but this weekend was the first time since the hotel renovated the rooms. We figured we would no longer be able to afford the hotel with the upgrades, but got a good email promotion and used it.\r\nThe renovation make the rooms look more contemporary and bright. My kids loved the new decor. The lighting is now excellent, and the new shades do such an excellent job at blocking out the light that we all overslept until 10:00 am on our first morning, even though it was a sunny day. We had a 1-bedroom suite this time - we usually just get a double/double, but the 1-bedroom was cheaper for some reason. It was extremely spacious. Every room we have ever had in this hotel is big by NYC standards, but the 1-bedroom we had was likely larger than many of the 1-bedroom apartments in this neighborhood.\r\nSo why not 5 stars? It seems that the renovations got rid of the full kitchens that the hotel used to have. There are no longer ovens in the room, which is fine for a weekend stay, but I loved having the oven when we were there longer. The sink is now tiny, making it difficult to wash pans. There are no cabinets for pans and silverware, which means that there are fewer of these things at your disposal in the room. The refrigerator is also now half-size, so there is only a miniscule freezer - probably not room for a pint of ice-cream. \r\nAlso, the renovations look great, but also a little cheap and like they might age quickly. Some of the wallpaper was already peeling in our room, the square sink is too flat on the bottom so doesn\'t completely drain, and the trays for holding soap and toiletries were already looking beat up and chipped.\r\nIf I had never stayed here before, the above wouldn\'t have bothered me.\r\nA note if you plan to use the pullout bed. At bedtime, we pulled out the sleeper sofa, and there were no sheets on it. When I called the front desk they said they only bring up sheets when guests ask for them. I appreciate that they want sheets to be fresh, but I thought it was weird that they didn\'t ask when I checked in since I had reserved a room for 4 people and had asked if there was a 2-bed room available when I checked in. (It was St Patrick\'s Day weekend, so all the rooms were already full.) I would think it would be standard practice to ask guests if they plan to use the pullout bed when checking in. That said, the sheets were brought right away, and the very nice employee who delivered them also went and got us a comforter when he had us look in the closet for one, and it was missing.\r\nAnother tip - the Duane Reade pharmacy in Penn Station right across the street from the hotel has much better prices on staples like milk, cereal, coffee, etc. than the little markets/convenience stores on 7th Ave near the hotel.'
4,'Great Boutique Hotel in Great Location','Stayed here for a night with my son in July. \r\nWe booked a standard room we pricelined for ~110 bucks. Great deal as it was highly discounted from the published rack rate. \r\nCheck in was really smooth and lobby/reception area was really nice. \r\nOur room was small as expected with an in-unit AC unit that worked very well. The room had a small desk, double bed and then sliding door that closed the bathroom and then opened up the closet. The bathroom was quite large and updated and very clean. The room suited all our needs as there was only one adult and a child traveling. \r\nThe bed was very comfortable and the bedding was really nice. We had no hallway/other guest noise. Only street noise which is normal for NYC. Sadly, i got a stomach bug and the front desk was really nice in giving us a later check out. \r\nThe location is perfect for NYC and close to buses/trains and right across from Penn Station. Definitely recommend Affinia'
4,'Great Location!','I loved the deal we got on this hotel so close to Penn Station and close to times square but hardly clogged with tourists. There\'s a great pub two blocks north. I do wish they posted that the high-speed internet that\'s offered in the rooms comes with a charge. I figured it was complimentary. Airport shuttle is not offerred complimentary. We took a taxi, which was cheaper than airport shuttle services offered by various companies. Since we were close to the subway and nj transit, we had the underground transportation in the bag....we can go anywhere without using a taxi. the metro tickets were reasonably priced and the subway system is not hard to master as long as you know exactly where you\'re going. The concierge staff is awesome!!!!!!!!!! I bought empire state building tickets from there so I avoid the lines. They were very helpful to give us pointers on which subway stations to take for certain spots we wanted to check out. I do wish the beds were a little bigger. I shared a bed and they seemed more like full size and I wished they were more like a queen size. Other than that, the room with the kitchennette was awesome. Loved the location. Would book there again.'
5,'2nd time!','I stayed at this hotel last year when I went to NYC and didn\'t think twice about this last trip. This is the first hotel that came to mind and I got a room on the 17th floor. Compared to the room on the 5th floor last time, I like this one much more. Granted the square footage is drastically less on the 17th floor than the 5th floor, but I do love that the street noise is slightly quieter and the room looks soo much cuter (just like in the pictures). I\'d book here every time I go to NYC from now on.'
4,'not a bad place','I sayed at southgate tower from nov. 26, to dec 1 2004 for business at the javits center.\r\nWhen we arrived (by car) the doorman assisted in getting parking, carrying our bags into hotel to the front desk and valet parked our car..without hesitation.\r\nOur room was on the 7th floor , 1 bedroon suite. ( rm 715) I tipped the gal at the front desk and she must\'ve given us one of the larger rooms, it was the size of NYC apartment, the living room was larger than the standard furniture and a full kitchen with room to spare. One queen sized bed and foldout couch in the front room. Bathroom was small but had a tub and was spotless. Plenty of closet space and nice down comforter on the bed.\r\nWe had no view and the lights from the business were a bit bright when they came back to work....but the shades took care of that. \r\ndownside....it is a noisy room, you can hear showers, doors slam, toilets flush, etc. I am half deaf so, the good ear on the pillow took care of that...but for others they may find it loud.\r\nWe needed extra sheets, blanket, pillows a call to room service took care of that in minutes. \r\nThe concierge there gave us great restaruant recomendations and was more than friendly as were all the staff.\r\nLocation is good....Macy\'s it very close, Times square a short walk, Javits center is walkable, Empire state is close, and MSG and penn station are literally across the street. Subway station is close and if you fly into EWR (newark) you can catch the train for 12.00 and end up across the street from your hotel...in a half hour......\r\nI had staff staying with me so the two rooms worked out great, we slept 3 or 4 no problem and the kitchen with utensils micro, etc saved us time and money.........\r\nall in all I would recomend it......unless you are a light sleeper.....'
3,'6th stay here','I like the affinia manhattan for it\'s location, room size, price, and value.\r\nI stay for 8 nights so to have a small kitchen with stove , refrig and sink is great. I can make my own breakfast and have snacks in the room at my conveinence.\r\nI get a one bedroom suite, the floor plans are always a little different but the room is spacious and comfortable. there is a fold out bed also in the living rooms.\r\nUpon checking in the woman rememebered me from last year! Mahalo Amanda! hope to see you next year!\r\nI don\'t think I \'ve stayed there when the escalator hadn\'t broken down at least once......I think it\'s a bit old............there are some other staff that are there that have been there everytime Ive stayed there and it nice to have familiar faces and gives me a feeling of Home. for those who travel a lot you know how nice that is.......\r\nas mentioned the hotel is in a very busy area and there is a police station and fire dept very close.....but I\'ve not had a problem sleeping there after a full day of NYC fun and walking..........\r\nit\'s an older building (built in 1925 I think) but for the price it\'s a great deal............If I had real money I\'d stay along the park or at the waldorf......but that a bit out of my means........\r\nI keep returning for the above mentioned reasons..........'
4,'sixth stay','I ve been staying at the affinia (was south gate tower) for six years in a row, checking the day before thanksgiving and staying 8 nights.\r\nI have always been met by very curteous doorman and front desk staff and concierge (some have been there everytime!)\r\nI like this hotel due to proximity to penn station as I fly into EWR and take the train into the city, the affinia is right across the street from the station, very easy .\r\nThe rooms have been a mixed bag. As some have/will mention the hotel is noisy by nature (next to fire station, near a police dept. and some rooms facing 7th ave.\r\nI accept that.\r\nDo not get a room number ending with a \'7\'! these wrap around the service elevator and are very noisy. We were checked in to one of these rooms and it was unbelievable how noisy it was, there is a laundry shute in the service room that is right next to the head of the bed and can be heard very clearly, along with the service carts and elevator. There were scraping sounds that seem to be right on the walls. We thought because of the renovation outside that was cuase of some of the noise, but on thanksgiving day it was still unbelievably noisy. Im not a complainer for the most part but my wife and I got no sleep the first night (we had arranged for another room before hand with two bathrooms but hotel was full ) I called the guest services, and explained, she tried to give me it\'s new york excuse for the noise but I told her I had stay there 5 times before and this was above any beyond \'city noise\'\r\nshe gave us two vouchers for breakfast and knocked off a hundred bucks per night (two nights) for our trouble.\r\nwe were moved to another room after two days and it was much better. It was a redisigned room and aside from the tiny bathrooms and the decontented remodeled kitchen (no more full sized regfrig and two burner stove) it was much more pleasant and the new paint, furniture and kitchen were aesthticly pleasing..............\r\nI like this hotel for the money, I bookd through the trade show I was doing and they rates are quite resonable.....the breakfast buffet is nice but not great..........as always the staff is top notch............'
5,'We loved it!!!','My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from Aug 19 -31... I have to say we loved it!!! The room was very clean and modern with a great little kitchenette, perfect for heating up left-overs... Or even to cook a small meal if needed. The bed... Ahhhhh The Bed, it was great and so were the pillows. Now the bathroom is not that big but that is not a place I usually hang out so it was fine with me. We left the room early every morning and when we returned it was nice and clean.. There is an in room safe which is a bonus.. Now the Concierge were fantastic. They have all your answers to all your questions. When Irene was set to hit... The Affinia Manhattan had all us informed of what they were doing to keep us safe and what if anything that we needed to do. I was not worried a bit. The hotel is a perfect location. Thank You Affinia Manhattan... We will be back!'
5,'<3 Affinia Manhattan','This Hotel is in a great location. Right in the middle of Manhattan! This is also my second time staying at the Affinia Manhattan.\r\nI was travelling with 3 other girlfriends when our trip was extended due to Hurricane Sandy. We could not get a flight out. The Affinia looked after us. They extended our room until we could get a flight out. That was 3 days later. They did not raise our room rate which I have heard horror stories of that after the fact at other hotels. They did not let our room to someone else because of more money either which I also heard horror stories about at other hotels. So Thank You Affinia. \r\nI agree with some of the other reviews in that it is noisy...even on the 18th floor. Those Church Bells are sure to wake you every morning at 7:00 am SHARP :) But that is not the Affinia\'s fault.\r\nThe cleaning staff, security, concierge and desk staff were all great to deal with. Johnathan was a sweetheart and Kyle at front desk...She and several other staff including security were so graceful when they had to deal with this... I don\'t even know what to call her!!! Some kind of crazy woman.. Seriously! I hope she reads this because no one needed to put up with her Bull&*^\%! Oh wait I am thinking if she reads this my choice of words would not meet her standard... I too would be called an uneducated moron. I really would have sent her on her way to stay at another hotel. The Staff at Affinia took her Bull(*&^ and gave her what she wanted. I seen her on the streets a couple of times and wanted to trip her... lol \r\nThere was some good and bad with that choice to accommodate her but whatever their reasoning they were beyond graceful to this Witch of a Woman!\r\nWe stayed in a 2 bathroom suite which was so awesome. Our only problem with it is there is not much counter space in the bathrooms. When you have 4 women together there tends to be a lot of cosmetics and no place to put them. Also another full length mirror would be awesome, like one just before leaving the room, there is that big empty wall to put it on. Also, I would really like free internet in our rooms.. It is free in the lobby, why not in the room as well...\r\nI love NYC and I love the Affinia Manhattan and I can\'t wait to go back again.'
3,'Great location, very helpful staff but a bit dingy','This hotel is in an amazing location right opposite Maddison Square Gardens and close to a station, Macy\'s and the tourist buses (which I took on my day off from work)\r\nWhen I arrived I found the fridge in my room rather noisy and the staff could not have been more helpful in ensuring I had a room to my satisfaction.\r\nI found the decor somewhat dingy and my room was very dark but it had all I needed to work and relax so overall not a bad stay.'
5,'Rooms so much improved','I stayed at this hotel in February 2011 and commented that my room was a bit dingy. Management responded to my posting and said that all the rooms were in the process of being upgraded. As I liked the hotel generally and it was so convenient, I decided to take a chance and booked a short break in May 2012. What an improvement! Our room was large, tastefully decorated with massive beds and a lovely little kitchen area. (Pity about the awful weather but that wasn’t the hotel’s fault!)\r\nThank you Affinia'
4,'Great hotel in midtown Manhattan','Great recently renovated hotel in midtown Manhattan. Great central location on 7th at 31st. The rooms have a kitchennette that comes in handy if you have kids. The only downside is that there is a fire station on 31st next to the hotel. We only had one disruption during a 3 night stay.'
5,'Excellent Hotel','We stayed at the Southgate Tower for 6 nights in April 2004. We had previously stayed at another hotel in New York but due to travelling with friends decided to try somewhere different with more room for us all.\r\nWhen we arrived at the hotel the reception staff were very friendly and apologised that our room was not quite ready. After about a 5 minute wait we were taken to our room with our luggage.\r\nWe were pleasantly surprised with the room. It was very spacious and perfect for 4 people sharing as there was plenty of room for us not to feel as though we were living on top of each other for the next 7 days. After taking a look around the room we noticed one of the blinds wouldn\'t stay down, we called reception and within 5 minutes they sent someone to our room to fix it. We had no further problems after that.\r\nThe suite we stayed in was perfect for us. It had 2 bathrooms, the bedroom had 2 double beds and plenty of space for clothing, the living room was very large and the sofa coverted into a sofa bed, and the kitchenette had all mods cons - fridge, microwave, tea/coffee making facilites, microwave. We also had an iron and ironing board and a television in the living room and bedroom.\r\nThe room was very clean and the chambermaids came round every day. They restocked the tea, coffee etc and always left clean towels. They were also happy to come back at a more convenient time if you were still in your room.\r\nThe hotel was in a perfect location, Madison Square Gardens is over the road, Macy\'s and other major stores are a couple of blocks away and so is the Empire State Building. We also took taxis to each end of the island and walked back to the hotel (which is roughly in the middle on Manhattan), this way we got to see more of Manhattan and did some shooping on the way.\r\nThere is a fire station underneath the hotel which can cause some noise, but nowhere in New York is quiet. We found that the noise didn\'t bother us and slept with the window open most nights.\r\nThe restaurant and bar that is connected to the hotel is also a place to visit if you don\'t feel like going too far one night. Although we didn\'t get chance to dine in the restaurant we found the bar staff very friendly and they made us feel very welcome. \r\nThe hotel staff were very friendly and recommended places to eat, they also pre booked a taxi for us when it was time to leave as we needed a people carrier to transport us to the airport.\r\nWe have looked at other hotels we could possibly stay in when we return to New York, but due to having such a great time at the Southgate Tower and due to it being in such a prime location we have decided we wouldn\'t stay anywhere else. We would recommend this hotel to everyone.'
5,'Second stay here and still excellent','We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 3 nights at the beginning of December 2011.\r\nI stayed at this hotel a few years ago and on my trip this time it was just as nice as I remembered.\r\nThe staff were all very polite and helpful. The rooms have been refurbished again since I was last there, the decor is lovely and calming and the beds are amazingly comfy which is what you want after a busy day in the city. \r\nWe had a two bed suite which was a great size for two girls who were there to shop, the kitchen was also handy for keeping drinks chilled. \r\nI like this hotel for it\'s location, you are pretty much in the middle of the city so it\'s nice and easy to grab a taxi to upper or lower Manhattan and then walk back to the hotel. \r\nNext time I go to New York this will be the first hotel I look at booking.'
4,'What a great find!','My Husband and I travelled to New York for the first time in February. We had absolutely no idea what to expect from this Hotel but I can assure you we were pleasantly surprised! \r\nThe good points: Big room, Comfy Bed, cleaned daily, plenty of storage and most importantly, a kitchen!!!! It was brilliant, saved so much money. We ended up doing a small shop for essentials like cereals, bread, milk etc. We got up at our leisure every morning, watched sky TV and had breakfast in peace. I can\'t bear all that bleary eyed, buffet breakfast room nonsense that you get in hotels where they dictate what time you will get up and eat! It also helped us after a hard days sightseeing. The last thing I wanted to do at night was go out and eat. Its REALLY expensive and the restaurants are not that great. So, we would grab take out somewhere and take it back to the room. Perfect!!!\r\nAlso, it is perfectly located. Close enough to walk everywhere yet far enough away that you can get away from the madness for five minutes.\r\nStaff can\'t do enough for you. There is a tourist info booth in the hotel lobby, use them!\r\nBad Points: The bathroom is TINY!!! It is only big enough for one person. I am 5ft, size 10 and I felt claustraphobic. If you are big people, maybe go somewhere else! The decor could do with updating and there was a bit of a draft through the windows.\r\nOverall this hotel was perfect for what we wanted. I would def go again.\r\nTry going down to Niles restaurant for a really tasty Cosmopolitan.\r\nGo across the road for brilliant Bagels. (Can\'t remember the name, come out of main hotel entrance, cross the road, turn to your left and walk until you need to cross again, the bagel shop is on your right.)'
4,'Another great stay','Just returned from Affinia Manhattan for the second time and again we thought it was great. Yes the decor is tired and the maids could really do with putting some elbow grease into the cleaning. But the bed is comfy, the location is great and the kitchen is very handy. \r\nLocation:: The hotel is across the road from Penn Station which services Amtrak and various subway lines. Handy if you are coming from Stamford, Boston, Philadelphia etc. Short walk up the road to Times Square and Empire State building. \r\nGo across the road to Mustang Sally\'s for friendly service, baseball games and great food at decent prices. Don\'t forget the Bagel shop, mentioned in our last review. (Still can\'t remember the name!) and Starbucks, both opposite the hotel. \r\nService: The concierge downstairs is a real bonus. They\'re always at the ready with ticket bookings, maps and advice. There is a dedicated check in and boarding pass computer for guest use, free of charge, which allows you to do as it says. check in and print your boarding pass. The toilets have a large cubicle with sink and plug point to allow for freshening up after check out and changing before your flight.\r\nOne big BEWARE! The doorman outside the hotel has got a thing going with a guy in a suit and a fancy car posing as a taxi but calling himself a \'town car\'. We heard these sharks operate everywhere but completely rip you off on fares (they don\'t have meters) and they don\'t have liability insurance. Stick with the yellow taxis. \r\nEnjoy New York!'
5,'Very nice!','Stayed for one night and loved the room. Was in a 2 bed, 350-400 square feet room on the 20th floor. The most important thing - a good night\'s sleep - was had by all. There was honking from the streets, but tolerable. The beds were very comfortable, loved the comforter and the pillow menu. Appreciated the complimentary toothpaste (had to call guest services to get it, but it came in a short time). The television was in an odd position, so it would\'ve been hard to watch from your bed, but we weren\'t in NYC to watch tv! There was a slight draft in the room from around the AC unit, but this was tolerable when the heat was on. The kitchenette was a great idea, although we didn\'t use it other than to make tea in the morning. The staff was fabulous and location was great, although a bit far from our Broadway show. Paid $179/night through Travelzoo and would return at this rate. Definitely felt like we got our money\'s worth.'
4,'Back again for a second time - definitely a great place to stay','I had been to the Affinia Manhattan 3 years earlier, so I didn\'t hesitate to stay on my return trip to NYC when I saw a promo for $139/night + tax. It was a steal at that price.\r\nA few highlights:\r\n-Still the only hotel I don\'t need to bring my own pillow since they have a great pillow selection\r\n-Huge, comfortable bed.. no sagging at all\r\n-Great location, across from Penn Station, reasonably close to Times Square, Broadway shows, Eataly, etc.\r\n-Kitchenette.. actually this is what makes this place so special! Breakfast is not included, but with the kitchenette, we were able to make our own oatmeal each morning (head to Trader Joe\'s for some quick cook steel cut oats, dried fruit, nuts and fresh fruit for a lovely, homemade breakfast in the morning). We also snagged a bunch of fixins for sandwiches from Eataly - with the knives from the kitchen, it was a snap to put them all together\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n-We were on the 19th floor, and the traffic noise was not that bad. The problem was that it is right overtop a fire station! The sirens were fairly constant early in the night but we were so exhausted, we were able to fall asleep each night regardless.\r\nAll-in-all, a great deal for NYC. I will definitely be back next time. :)'
4,'Great location, friendly staff, lovely room!','I was a bit apprehensive arriving here, as i had read some bad reviews, it was my first visit to NY - so shopping and sighseeing were my priority! Loved this hotel....excellent location! Plenty of places to get breakfast nearby and Times Square was just a ten minute walk! Macys was a 2 minute walk and loads more shops were just around teh corner.\r\nOur room was lovely, got hopusekeeping everyday - they couldnt of done more. Bathroom, was clean and modern with plenty of supplies.\r\nLovely bar next door - they do great cocktails.\r\nConcierge were helpful.\r\nReception were accomadating, considering my Credit Card was out of action until day 3, but they were ok with that.'
4,'Great location, ticked all the box\'s!','Stayed here on my first trip to NYC with my boyfriend! Perfect location, Macys and all the other popular stores are just one block away, Empire State Builing was only a few blocks away. Plenty of cafe\'s right beside the hotel for coffee or breakfast!\r\nStaff were very nice, I had issues with my credid card on arrival and they were very accomadating! Received fresh towels everyday!\r\nI will definitely choosing this hotel for my next trip to NYC.'
4,'Excelente ubicacion','Varias veces por trabajo pare en el Affinia Manhattan y el reciclado le ha venisdo perfecto! Agrego una decoracion moderna a sus superespaciosas habitaciones,las suites con 2,si 2 sanitarios un lujo absoluto para NY NY!La atencion del frotdesk optima.'
2,Decepcion!,'Fui por trabajo una vez mas al Affinia Manhattan ,mi hotel en New York,porque privilegio metros y ubicacion,pero esta vez fue realmente decepcionante.Reserve por Booking una suite para 2 personas con 2 camas,teoricamente de mas de 40 metros.Al llegar la habitacion tenia maximo 25 metros,un placar infimo,el baño idem,dividido de la habitacion por un vidrio esmerilado y una puerta corrediza (en un baño creo que todos pretendemos privacidad).Pedii un cambio de habitacion y no fueron amables negandome mi reclamo,me resigne a la habitacion otorgada.En los 8 dias que estuve solo una vez cambiaron los amenities,tuve que pedir el 5 dia cambio de sabanas,reposicion de papel higienico y te. No retiraron la basura 2 dias.La limpieza dejo mucho que desear. En fin buscare otro hotel!'
5,'One of My Favorites','Three friends and I booked this hotel through Travelocity\'s Last Minute Package. Prior to our trip, none of us were at all familiar with the hotel and were very pleasantly surprised upon arrival.\r\nThe lobby was extremely nice and very large. Because our flight put us in the city at 8:30 in the morning and check-in wasn\'t until later that afternoon, we were happy to hear that the hotel would store our luggage at no extra cost until our room was ready.\r\nThe room itself was very large - a studio suite with 2 beds. The four of us brought a ton of luggage (and left with even more!) yet the room never seemed too crowded with all of our belongings. It was very nice to have the couch and the kitchen area.\r\nThe only drawback was the tiny, tiny bathroom. There was very little room to move around and one of our inside jokes for the entire trip was that the bathroom was actually a closet.\r\nThe actual location of the hotel was very convenient. It\'s a block away from Madison Square Gardens, and a block away from the 1,2, and 3 lines. The Europe Cafe is on the same block, and we enjoyed breakfast there every morning.\r\nI highly recommend this hotel to anyone!'
5,'Splendor and Elegance','The beauty of the lobby is only exceeded by the fabulous attention to excellent service. It is rich in history and yet modern day amenities. Superb on every level. And pet friendly.'
5,'Fabulous historic Chicago hotel','This is a must see and stay. Experience the opulence and historic grandeur of the gift Potter Palmer gave to his bride as a wedding gift, The Palmer House. The lobby ceilings were restored by Lido Lippi. The same Lido Lippi who restored the Sistine Chapel.The winged angels outside the the entrance to Empire Room were designed by non other than Louis Comfort Tiffany.\r\nBe sure to visit the Lakewood dining room as have one of Bertha Palmer\'s famous Chocolate Fudge Brownies. It is worth the trip just for the brownie and people watch in the lobby.\r\nIf you have the opportunity take the tour  History is Hott with Ken Price.\r\nThis Chicago landmark is one gracious, elegant lady.'
4,'Nice stay at Chicago Landmark','I stayed at the Palmer House mid-week between Christmas and New Year\'s of 2005. I have stayed there a number of times and my previous experiences were mixed (mainly because of the thin walls and noise), but this was very pleasant and quiet. I have often stayed as part of a conference on May weekends when it is noisier because the Palmer House hosts many wedding receptions and the wedding guests get rooms and they are loud and in and out all night long.\r\nThere are newer hotels in Chicago that are more luxurious and have better amenities, but the Palmer House IS a landmark. The lobby is beautiful and had a gorgeous Christmas tree. My sister and I had a 2 bed, 2 bathroom room that was huge for only $154/night (including tax). The rooms are comfortable and clean, but a bit worn around the edges. The \'extras\' are expensive, but no more so than in most other city hotels. We didn\'t park a car (self-park $25/night) or use the high speed in-room internet ($10 per day) or eat at the over-priced restaurants. \r\nThe concierge was very helpful and check-in and check-out were efficient. The bell staff was helpful and checked our bags for us after check-out (which is 11 am...you can stay 2 hours later for $25) while we shopped. There is an Osco Drug next door and many cheaper restaurants within an easy walk. Try the Russian Tea Time on Adams near the Art Institute.'
4,'Classic old hotel, great location, executive floor worth extra cost','I have stayed at the Palmer House many times over the course of several decades. The fact that I keep coming back says something about the hotel. The location is great and you do feel like you\'ve stepped into another era...until you see someone walk through the lobby wearing a t-shirt and baseball cap. \r\nWe had a great stay in a room with 2 beds and 2 baths on the Executive Floor. The Executive Floor cost $40 more per night but it included a private elevator that skips most floors (this is a huge hotel and the elevators are full and slow), complimentary soft drinks, snack mix, and cookies all day. Complimentary hors d\'oeuvres during the happy hour (my glass of wine was $10) included cheese, fruits, crackers, spinach dip, and hummus. Complimentary breakfast which included cold cereals, coffee, juice, bagels, hard-boiled eggs, meat, cheese, muffins, croissants, and granola bars.\r\nWords of warning. The room sizes vary a lot so your room could be not much bigger than a closet or extremely spacious. If you are next door to a wedding party that is in and out of their room all night, you will get a lousy night\'s sleep. The check-in line is always slow (though they handed out free popcorn and bottled water while we were in line). Internet access is outrageously priced. As in all city hotels, parking is also very expensive.'
4,'Surprisingly Nice Experience','We were surprised that our stay at the Palmer House Hilton was so nice. This is a very large hotel with a fairly ornate lobby that is definitely worth seeing. We had a very nice room with a comfortable bed. The person who checked us in took time to check the hotel room map and tried to make sure that we had a nice room for our stay (this is a strategy to consider when checking in, even if it means delaying check in until a nice room is available). We were at the Palmer House for multiple days and noticed considerable variation in the size of rooms. Our room did not have wireless Internet, but did have Internet access over Ethernet. The Internet at the Palmer House Hilton is overpriced ($15-20 per night if I remember correctly). This is far too high. They should also have wireless Internet access in all rooms.'
4,'Another Good Experience','We had another good experience at the Palmer House Hilton. Our room was renovated and comfortable. This hotel does not have wireless Internet, which makes getting online more difficult than it should be in 2011.'
4,'Nice but they need to watch to maintain this level of service','I am a regular at the Palmer House. It is a great hotel. The rooms vary a lot in size and appointments. During our last stay, we were given a tiny room. It is a bit shotty for a Hilton Diamond member. We also only had three towels. After asking for four once, we continue to only get three towels. Something like that should not have needed daily calls. We also saw some cracker crumps on the carpet when we first checked in and had to flag down a maid to come in for it. Also, the mail service is a bit irregular. After I have picked up my Fed Ex envelope, I continue to have a message sent to me about having a package waiting for me. Whatever happened to having it delivered to me? Fed Ex is handled by the UPS store in the building and they are not open on weekends so picking up a package can be tricky. Delivery is the answer!!! Otherwise, the hotel is nice but my smaller complaints are signs of decline. The bath tub drain was very slow but they came and fixed it very quickly. As much as I love this hotel, these are the things that tarnish a great hotel. They must put these things to a halt before it loses its position as one of the grand dames of Chicago hotels. Service and amenities in the executive floor are still good. Keep up the good work and fix your problems, please!!!'
5,'Great Chicago Hotel','The Palmer House is pretty much my only Chicago hotel unless the location just wouldn\'t work for me. It is the hotel that my children (now adults) grew up knowing about Chicago. The location is great for dining, shopping and the arts. It is close to the Millennium Park area. The hotel is a historic landmark that began in the later part of the 19th century. The rooms are always interesting as it seems every time is completely different. Over the years, it has ranged from standard (but very nice) to some with two bathrooms and once in a while a large suite with a living room, a dining room and bar area. The concierge lounge floor is amazing as with the staff there. The last time pulling up at the front, both the parking valet and the older doorman recognized us as the folks from Minnesota. That was pretty special. We are there several times a year maximum and some years only once. The overall ambiance, the service, the attitude of the staff and the appointment, amenities and the housekeeping are all perfect. Three generations of my family have enjoyed it over the years. It is a great Chicago hotel, dignified and fantastic.'
5,'My home away from home in Chicago','This is a grand dame of a hotel in Chicago, built in the 1870\'s. It is a great hotel although quite large and offers only regular service that you would expect in a fine but large hotel. It has pretty much everything you will need. The location is great and the staff is friendly and courteous. This is my top Chicago choice for business, family vacation, theater and shopping. The lobby is a sight to see. They don\'t build them like that any more.'
4,'Great Hotel','This a great old Hotel with a nice history.\r\nit\'s my second visit here and will be back soon.\r\nEverything is close, almost walking distance'
5,'A great Hotel','This was 3rd time in Chicago for the GraphExpo show.\r\nAnd I just can\'t get enough of this hotel the service is great and it\'s a beautiful hotel.\r\nIt\'s close to everything . It just a wonderful hotel with great restaurants and good food and great service .I will stay there again whenever I am in town.'
4,'Great Location for Fireworks','My husband and I stayed overnight at the Palmer House on July 3, 2007 to be downtown for the 4th of July fireworks.\r\nLOCATION\r\nThis hotel is in a terrific location for the fireworks. You are two blocks away from the Taste of Chicago and the Petrillo Band shelter. If you go one more block east, you walk thru Buckingham Fountain and are right at the Lake. The fireworks are set off from a barge on the lake, and this is the perfect location to see them.\r\nSECURITY\r\nThere was a virtual sea of people flooding the streets after the fireworks. We walked in the crowd and got to the front of our hotel. There were at least 10 security guards outside the hotel, asking to see your room key before they would let you in. I thought that was great. When we left our room initially to go to the fireworks, we saw\r\na security guard patrolling the halls on our floor. He spoke to us and said the hotel was a full capacity and all the security staff were working that evening. This hotel really had their act together.\r\nLOBBY AREA\r\nThe common area of the lobby features a gorgeous bar and many comfortable, elegant high-back gold velvet chairs scattered throughout. There are comfy sofas, cute end tables and coffee tables too. The tables had a beautiful vase with glass marbles, water and lit candles floating amidst fresh, fragrant flowers. The lobby smelled heavenly as a result of the floral displays and the candle décor really added a nice touch. My husband and I had a drink there around 7pm, before we went down to see the fireworks. As soon as you sit down, a waiter gets your drink order and gives you a snack mix (chex mix kind of thing) to accompany your drink. Just sitting there gazing at all the frescos, paintings and elaborate moldings in this historic room is worth staying at this hotel. It was lovely.\r\nSWIMMING POOL\r\nWe did not go swimming due to time constraints, but we did go to the 8th floor to see it. The pool is rectangular and small. (This is NOT an Olympic size pool or anything…I would estimate that it is less than one half the size of an Olympic size pool.) There were chairs scattered around so you could sit and watch the people swim while you read or something. The ceiling is really high and glass (like a greenhouse) which would let in lots of light. There were parents with\r\nkids swimming while we checked it out at approximately 7pm on Tuesday\r\nnight.\r\nROOM\r\nWe were on the 18th floor. When the elevator doors open, there are pretty chairs and floral arrangements in the lobby area that look really nice. We got to our room and found it to be adequate. (After all, we were just sleeping there.) The building is really old and as a result, the ceilings are kind of low. (Around 7 feet, I would say…)\r\nFor example, I could literally reach up and touch the ceiling fixtures in the halls and I’m only 5 feet 1. Our room was a little on\r\nthe small side, and seemed smaller due to the low ceiling. The bathroom was really super-tiny. My husband kept bumping his arm into the walls in there as the tried to brush his teeth at night. But, it was clean and well-decorated. The soaps and shampoo stuff was Crabtree and Evelyn and smelled divine. The room had a coffeemaker in\r\nit.\r\nPRICE\r\nI booked the hotel directly on the Hilton website for $179.00. They add a room tax later which brings the bill up to a little over $200. I felt that was reasonable, given the great location during a holiday.\r\nPARKING\r\nWe live in the suburbs and drove into the city. We used the Hilton’s valet service and let them park our car. That was $38. It was kind of pricey but we were willing to pay for the convenience. We wanted to simply drop off the car, check in to the hotel and then wander around. So it worked out well for us. Plus, when we checked out the next day, they got us our car in a matter of a few minutes. That was great. I saw a self-park high-rise garage right next to the hotel, but during crowded holidays I don’t know how that would be. (I think the sea of people after the fireworks would have kept you from pulling out for hours and hours. And the frustration of trying to \r\nfind a spot in the garage in the first place, seems like it would be a pain to me.)\r\nOVERALL\r\nThis is a nice hotel with a historic feel to it. The location was great for our purposes and all the staff we dealt with (check-in, security, bar, valet etc) were professional, polite and friendly even\r\nthough it was obviously a busy evening for them. The hotel was well-staffed to cover the added traffic. We would stay here again. If you have any questions, my email is: pborowia@netscape.net.'
5,'Wonderful location for 4th of July!','My husband and I stayed her for the 4th of July, overnight till the 5th. We stayed here once before to see the Chicago fireworks and found the location to be perfect. This year the Chicago Fireworks were spread out to three locations, but this hotel was still perfect.\r\nLocation\r\nThe location is only a few blocks west of Lake Michigan. We passed the Art Institute and then the Taste of Chicago entrance on our walk to the lake. Instead of eating at the Taste, we walked to the lakefront and enjoyed a (crowd-free) hotdog at a small stand overlooking the docked boats. As you walk along the lake, there are plenty of place to eat. Ironically, there is a Robinson Rib stand right on the lake. I was laughing thinking of the hot, sweaty line you would be standing in at the Taste, when a great rib is only a short jaunt away! The following morning, we had breakfast at a local McDonalds conveniently located one block away.\r\nRooms\r\nThe ceilings are low but the decor is lovely. The bathrooms are small but efficient, with gorgeous marble sinks, great lighting and large mirror. The toiletries are brand name Crabtree and Evelyn products that smell heavenly. The safe is conveniently located in the closet. Most importantly (for us) the soundproofing is excellent. We slept late and enjoyed a very quiet sleeping environment.\r\nGeneral Areas\r\nAfter arriving, we threw our luggage in the room and went downstairs to have a cocktail in the lobby. We sat at a marble table with bar stools and people-watched as we sipped our drinks. The lighting, decor and general ambiance of this hotel lobby is wonderful. We grabbed a cab having dinner elsewhere. We arrived back to hotel after dinner and walked down to the lakefront for the fireworks. The fireworks from Navy Pier were readily visible. The hallways to the rooms display classy B/W photos of old movie stars which is a nice touch.\r\nService\r\nWhen we first arrived, check in was a breeze even though it was a holiday weekend. Check out was super-simple. We got a bill slipped under our door in the middle of the night. We simply called the number on the bill and checked out over an automated phone system, leaving the keys in the room.\r\nWe enjoyed our stay here and really like the historical feel of this hotel. It\'s a gem!'
4,'Beautiful Old, Grand Hotel','I have been fortunate enough to stay at the Palmer House on several occations. When you think of extravegent hotels from the early 1900\'s, the Palmer House has to be near the top of the list. One chooses the Palmer House because of its history. It is not flashy. Modern hotels may have more ammenities but they lack the charm.\r\nIt does not matter how many times I walk into the lobby, it is stunning, even opulent. At Christmas time, there is a tree that is beautifully decorated that stands at least 25 feet tall. Check in has always been fast with pleasant help. I have found the concierge to be most helpful. Ask about the hotel\'s past. The concierge will gladly tell you. They will even give you a packet of information.\r\nThe rooms, for the most part, are small. The hotel was built almost 100 years ago. This was the style. Yes, the bathrooms are small and lack space. Again, early 1900\'s! One thing about the rooms that no one should complain about are the beds, sheets and blankets. I believe the beds are Serta Serenity series. They are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on, including my own! I like a harder surface. My wife likes a much softer one. We both agreed that this is the next bed we will purchase. The sheets and blankets are very comfortable. I get hot. My wife gets cold. Again, we were both comfortable. I agree with other reviews that the carpet could be updated. Other than that, the rooms are quite clean.\r\nThe hotel\'s fitness center is the best I have seen. It is not just a room that has been converted into a health area with one treadmill and an eliptical. This is a mini health club. The pool may not be olympic size but one can still swim laps, unlike most new hotel pools.\r\nI have read several reviews of the pricey parking. This is true but parking is pricey anywhere in downtown Chicago. If you drive, just plan for it as part of your expenses.\r\nOne of the best parts about the Palmer House is its location. The Magnificent Mile is just a few blocks away. Major sight seeing venues are easily within walking distance, the Sears Tower, Shedd Aquarium, Field Musium, the Art Institute just to name a few. Catch a play at any of the several theatres near by. One will not want for great food. There are a ton of great restaurants within walking distance or within a short cab ride away. Miller\'s Pub, established in 1935 has fantastic food. It is one of those places that celebrities throughout the decades have flocked to. The place is jammed with autographed photos from the restaurant\'s beginning to the present. The Berghoff is less than five minutes away. Take a cab north, five minutes. You have your choice of Ditka\'s, The Weber Grill, Smith & Wollensky, Wild Fire... The list could go on forever.\r\nThe bottom line is if you are looking for a flashy new hotel with all of the modern ammenities, this is not the hotel for you. If you want to experience what life was like for the upper crust a nearly a century ago, give this hotel a try. Do go through one of the on line travel sites as the rates are quite high.'
5,'Its the People Who Make This Grand Old Hotel Grand','I have stayed at the Palmer House about a half dozen times. I love the grandness of this old hotel and can over look the small bathrooms in the rooms. I love walking into the majestic lobby. I love the Serta Serenity beds (I want one!). I love the location with availability to museums, shopping and some of the finest restaurants close by.\r\nIt occurred to me on my last trip what I love best. It is the people. It starts when you get out of your car. The doormen are always pleasant and get your luggage. The bellmen are courteous and will get your luggage to your room. The front desk people are helpful and always have a pleasant word. Note, there were long lines at the desk when we checked in but there were several people behind the desk and the lines moved quite fast. \r\nThe face of the Palmer House is a tall, bald, black gentleman who works on the 23rd floor executive level. I am sorry I did not get his name but he is the MOST positive, happy person I have had the pleasure to be around. He works in afternoon/evening time and has been there my last two visits.\r\nYes, I will stay at the Palmer House again. Partly because of the location, the lobby and the beds but it is the people that ultimately brings me back.'
5,'Great Property in a great location!!','Hotel is staffed very well and they ALWAYS recognize our status which is a breath of fresh air.'
5,'Very Well Property Right In Middle of Chicago','We have stayed here on many occasions and have found that it is run very well. It is staffed properly with well trained employees. From the front desk with Marco to the Asst Director of Front Office Operations Koba Bruce. Any property would be lucky to be staffed with these type of employees. The service level is unparalleled even when at or near 100\%. We were there during Lollapalooza so they were pretty much full. Everything about this stay was GREAT and we will definitely be back!'
5,'A Grand Hotel that makes you breathe deeply','The Palmer House always causes me to breathe deeply upon entering the fantastic lobby. The Palmer House has excellent lobby life going on, full of people sitting, talking, rubbing elbows, socializing and refreshing themselves with drinks and food. I feel this aspect sets Palmer House apart from many hotels that seem nothing more than a line of peoplewith little incentive or space to linger, meet and talk to fellow travellers. This historic hotel is packed with art, impossibly lavish ball rooms and enough winding hall ways packed with pictures to qualify as a museam of Chicago itself. I took the executive level upgrade and liked that the room was larger and had two bathrooms, gorgeous decor but the executive level lounge was in my opinion rather depressing offering over priced beer and rather dull and limited snack and breakfast selections. Besides, who would want to linger in the executive lounge when you could linger in the lobby with it\'s newly and gorgeous renovation of the bar and restaurant. I\'ve been to the Palmer House many times in 40 years and am delighted to see it more exciting than it has been in awhile. On this visit to Chicago I stayed at three hotels, including the Palmer House, the Hotel InterContinental and the Trump Tower. I liked them in the order I listed and found the Trump Tower disappointing and the Palmer House really stands out as a fine hotel, worth the expense; and I stay in hotels many, many times per year.'
5,'Fun and Beautiful Hotel, Adjoining Rooms With Fireplace','I have stayed at the Palmer House and gone to events there countless times over decades and I have never had a bad experience in any way. The lobby of the hotel is massive and designed to encourage many people to sit there, have refreshments and enjoy the fantastic Beaux Arts design. This is an old, classic hotel and every time I stay there I feel I have slipped into a movie while people watching in the lobby or better yet having a perfect martini at the lobby bar which is incorporated into the fantastic lobby. You should take the hotel offered tour if you are a history or architecture buff, or even walk around yourself on some of the floors to look at the art, photographs and ballrooms. It is a place of crystal chandeliered sparkle, artistic plaster and paint, grandiose architecture dreams, history and the hotel knows well how to do it\'s business. The gym is very large and very well equipped. There is a Starbucks on the lower level and a few shops along with a night club and restaurant. \r\nThe best rooms are on the executive level, served by a seperate elevator and set up with it\'s own rather large and very nice lounge that offers a very decent breakfast and evening set up of foods and drinks. Like any hotel, there are some rooms that are less than ideal, such as the ones facing the el tracks, but I find if you book directly with hotels, by phone and do not pay discounted prices through 3rd party brokers on line you will always get a better room. With hotel rooms I think you get what you pay for, but even an entry level room on the el tracks is in no way bad. This last stay I had an adjoining room. Both were the height of elegance for the era, one with two bathrooms, the other with a fireplace and lovely sitting area. I have always enjoyed the Palmer House Hotel and would have a hard time picking between the Palmer House and Trump Hotel, both are outstanding but different as night and day.'
3,'Just OK','I booked this hotel on a discount website, not knowing exact hotel, only general location before I booked. Having said that, I guess I am satisfied, considering the rate I got. However, booking through this website did not guarantee a specific room, and when I arrived, I was told that there were only smoking rooms still available. Much to my surprise, in Illinois there can still be smoking rooms at hotels. We are clearly NOT smokers, and I\'m not sure if I was taken or not, but we were offered an upgrade for $49/night for a king non-smoking room on the Executive Level. Observing our hesitancy to upgrade (remember, I booked the room at a discount rate for a reason), we were quickly offered another room on the Executive Level for $39/night. Detesting the smell of cigarette smoke, I went ahead and took the upgrade and still paid less than the advertised rate. \r\nThe hotel itself is beautiful, nistoric etc., and in an ok location, down near Grant & Millenium Park, and is close to bus routes that will take you to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, etc. However, being woke up at midnight because of a woman in the next room pleading with someone to not go out displeased me. Having heard her in normal conversation earlier in the day and clearly understanding her every word I realized that the walls were very thin, and feared that this would become a problem later in the evening. I was right. Second negative on the hotel was the size of the bathroom. There was NO counter space, whatsoever, and only 1 standing spot in the tiny bath. Third negative....no free wi-fi, no free exercise room....it all cost extra. Oh, on the executive floor, there are two computers to use, and that served our purpose for our weekend trip. Another negative for some....near the train, so you can hear every one that goes by...even on the 23rd floor, but that noise didn\'t bother us nearly as much as the aforementioned female in the next room.\r\nExecutive Level guests get free continental breakfast every morning...too many carbs for me...went elsewhere....and hors d\'oeuvres every evening.....which was a nice touch. Free non-alcoholic beverages 24/7 to Executive Level guests, and private bar service on the 23rd floor (not free, obviously, but convenient). \r\nOverall, I guess if I knew all of what I have said upfront, and was paying the going rate for this hotel, I would go elsewhere. The circumstances being what they were, it was ok for the weekend.'
4,'Second Chance','I was in Chicago for the half-marathon, and when I made my reservations I discovered that the Palmer House Hilton was one of two (maybe 3?) partner hotels for the event. The other was the Sheraton. The Sheraton is my preferred hotel when in Chicago, I have stayed there numerous times, however, by the time I attempted to make reservations, no rooms were available there. So I was left with the Palmer House as basically my only choice for a hotel that I knew would be in a good location and also in an area near where I needed to be. I hesitantly made reservations, although my only other experience at this hotel had been less than desirable. Since I had posted a review of that past stay, I felt it only right that I should again post, because this stay was much more pleasurable than the last and I\'m glad I gave the hotel a second chance. I can say now that I would stay there again, although had I not been forced to, my experience during my last stay would have caused me to not choose the Palmer House. This time, I found the room to be quiet, good size and better than I had expected. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms could use updating, but all I really expect out of a hotel room is comfort and cleanliness. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The location is perfect. It is quite a walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, but whenever we go to Chicago, we park the car and expect to walk A LOT, so it was within reason for us. The bathroom is somewhat small in the room we were in, but still adequate. We visited the spa and enjoyed a couples massage and that was a nice treat. The spa is tranquil and relaxing. The only reason I did not give this hotel an excellent rating this time is that I prefer a more up to date facility. But if you want to experience a little bit of history, this is the hotel for you. Photos of all of the many stars who played the Empire Room at the hotel adorn the hallways and it is quite interesting to imagine how it might have been to be a guest there back in the day. My last stay made me not too happy to have to find myself at the Palmer House again. This stay wiped away that hesitancy. I would definitely stay again.'
4,'Third times a charm','What a great hotel. The rooms had plenty of space; the staff was very friendly; and you right in the heart of the city. We were just a block away from the park and three blocks from the lake. 10-15 minutes away from most attractions. Starbucks on ground floor.'
4,'It\'s Worth It','This was my fourth staff at the Palmer House over the last few years and they continue to wow me. As we entered the hotel there was a group of people on the steps singing Christmas Carols. The lobby was fully decorated. The 20\' tree was outstanding and the entire atmosphere just put you in the holiday mood. The staff was great as usual and being a Hilton Gold Member it was nice being on the Hilton Honors floor with all the various offerings. The hotel is located right in the middle of everything with plenty to do within a short walk or cab ride. And all this for the right price. This is one of my favorite places to stay in downtown Chicago.'
4,'Beautiful old hotel with great location','I am inclined to love this hotel, since I began staying there many decades ago. It has Old World charm, has been well-maintained, guest service is good, and the public areas ar beautiful, if hectic. It has aged better than many other properties of its type.\r\nArrival can be a bit confusing, since much of what you do involves elevators or stairs, some corners and turns, and then a possible queue. It is a busy place. They handle the crowds pretty well, and give each guest (well, at least this was my experience) individual attention. Without asking my room was upgrades to a spacious one room suite, with a view of an airshaft and fire escape... but I had asked for quiet and was advised that the El runs in front so I did not care about the view. Fine idea. It was spacious, clean, a little quirky (the chartreuse pillows were a bit on the bordello side, but I think that it is an attempt to be a bit funky/hip.) I had a closet nook larger than most NYC hotel rooms, a couple of cozy chartreuse armchairs, tons of walking around space, and a curiously cramped bathroom. It was a NY bathroom but had all the mod cons.\r\nThe food was good and room service was prompt and accurate. I needed to ship something and was directed right to a UPS store in the building. The elevators can be slow. The bed was quite comfortable and aside from a shared door with another room (full of girls on holiday who laughed and drank a bit too late and too loudly) it was a great stay at a competitive rate.\r\nSo much is within walking distance that the location is superb. Have fun.'
4,'Old Comfy Hotel','A very nice comy old Chicago Hotel (Mark Twain hosted the opening party). Staff very efficient helping with luggage and check-in. Our room had two bathrooms.\r\nThe hotel restaurant is OK for breakfast though the Corner Bakery on the same block is cheaper. My wife and I stayed for two nights and treated ourself to dinner in the Lockwood restaurant one night - $190 for two but it was very nice. The other night we went to the Berghoff restaurant on the next block - another old Chicago institution.'
4,'Splendid old hotel','This is an historic hotel by US standards (anything before 1900 is historic in \r\nUS). My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights. The location is excellent, handy for parks, shops and attractions. Large flat screen HD TVs are a great addition to the rooms. The only downside could be smaller rooms and bathrooms than usually expected in the US. The pleasant staff and surroundings more than outweigh that though.'
3,'Nice Old Hotel','The lobby in this old hotel is beautiful and is a great way to begin your stay. Unfortunately, they\'ve filled the lobby with bar tables in place of the quiet classical music of a couple years ago. Do not book this hotel through an internet agency - they have very very small rooms for those who pay lower internet rates. Book the hotel through Hilton, and specify a large room. \r\nThe location isn\'t bad for the loop area, but its a bit of a walk to the North Michigan area. This is the perfect hotel for CTA availablilty - the elevated is available at the Wabash entrance, and the Red line is available at the State Street Entrance. If you do not use the valet parking, there will be very little room to leave your car while checking in - and they bell hop will be very upset with you.'
3,'Beautiful Old Hotel located in the loop.','There are times when we prefer to stay in the loop over the Magnificent mile, and at those times, this is the perfect location. It is only a couple blocks from the old Macy\'s, and easily accessible to all \'L\' lines. We arrived at 10:30, and made a special room request, which the desk clerk said he could easily honor, but that we\'d have to wait to check in until 2:00pm. This was not a problem, and we enjoyed Chicago activities until 2:00pm. The desk clerk knew nothing about our previous arrangements, but said he could help us. He said we\'d have to wait no longer than 45 minutes for our room, and that they were already cleaning it. We returned to the desk at 2:45pm, and again the clerk knew anything about our previous arrangements. She apologized and actually made work of finding us a room. By 4:30pm, we were finally checking in. I felt like the first two clerks had just tried to get rid of us, but the third clerk was amazing. We were granted our request, and were pleased with it. I must say though, that the last 45 minutes dragged a bit as we waited in the Lobby with our grandchildren. \r\nA second inconvenience was a large wedding that was celebrating in the entry, and made it impossible to get through. I\'d have expected the hotel to rope off a path for incoming and outgoing patrons. \r\nHaving said that, this is a beautiful hotel. We\'ve visited it often and love the lobby. When you register, or make your reservation, be sure you aren\'t getting a small room. While a large room isn\'t necessary, the small rooms here have barely enough room to walk between the bed and other furniture. I\'d not give the small rooms a 4 star rating. The larger rooms however, and nicely decorated and very pleasant. The staff varies widely from the best ever to below average. I\'ve not read other reviews, but I\'d guess the reaction to the hotel varies greatly. I\'d love to see this beautiful old hotel return to the excellence it once enjoyed, but budget cuts may make this difficult. \r\nWhen you stay here, be sure to visit the new beautiful Millennium Park, the Cajun restaurant, heaven on seven at 111 N. Wabash, and visit the cultural center on Michigan Ave, between Randolph and Washington to learn about attractions available during your visit.'
4,'ottimo apparte la dimenticanza','la posizione di questo hotel è centralissima e molto facilmente raggiungibile anche dall\'aeroporto con la metropolitana linea blu usita monroe, poi 3-400 metri a piedi e ci siete.\r\nl\'hotel si presenta veramente di classe, all\'entrata una stanza eccezionale, con il soffitto tutto affrescato e poi su in stanza, veramente carina e accogliente, anche se si sono dimenticati di pulire il bagno,... una schifezza, comunque poi lo hanno pulito subito quando li ho chiamati anche se erano le 21.30 di domenica sera.\r\nPalestra attrezzatissima di tutti i macchinari possibili e piscina piccola ma carina, da notare anche la sauna.'
5,'ottimo, consigli a tutti di passarci e ripassarci','oserei dire che la prima volta che sono venuto ho capito cosa vule dire trattarsi bene e ora sono tornato. 200 $ si! ma credetemi che ne vale la pena, altri hotel più scarsi sono più cari o costano 20 $ in meno, ma di qui ci passa tutta chicago, la sera, spece quelle del fine settimana nella lounge bar al piano terra ci passa una sacco di gente e tutti per bene. le camere poi sono veramente ottima. consigli a tutti di soggiornare qui.\r\nciao e buon viaggio'
4,Vintage,'Like the Fairmonts, this hotel does not disappoint! Going back for a third time in a week, I speak from experiance!\r\nThe Palmer House is the most beautiful old feel/styling I have seen in a while. The lobby especially makes me feel like i\'m in an old time hotel. They maintain it just so beautifully you can\'t resist to take a sniff of the crisp old time air. A hint of cigar and old hotel which makes yuo feel so awsome when on a trip. \r\nChecking-in is very impressive, from the people who can speak English to Swahili and Japanese to Mandarin it is just impressive to see all of their nametags lined up with what they can speak. It\'s just awsome to ask them to say everything they just said in their secondary for sheer enjoyment!\r\nTravel up the express elevators to your floor to go to the vintage hallways once again to your rooms, which look out into the pool courtyard or one of the many sides of the hotel. I have only had Courtyard view, but it is still a great view!\r\nThe rooms are old, but new. Comfortable beds, up to date internet and clocks from the next generation! Desks and seating areas are also available.\r\nOverall amazing hotel, i\'m surprised it\'s only recieved a 3.5... Definitely stay here if you get a chance!'
5,'Excellent... as always!','I\'m glad to be writing another review of the Palmer House HIlton. For years it\'s been one of my favourites since I first started traveling to Chicago. Each time I return and stay at a different property I always compare my stay with my 2 previous stays at the Palmer House. \r\nThe first stay was in the pre-renovation days which had old world charm. The second stay was post renovation which had the refreshed and new-age look to it. This current stay was of course post-renovation and in a different room category tom the ones I had before. \r\nBooking through AAVacations (highly recommended!) we were offered a Single Bed, Double Occupancy or Double Beds, Double Occupancy which came with a heavily discounted round trip flight on American Eagle. AAVacations provided me with a Hotel Voucher which meant that I would not have to pay the hotel anything (except for incidentals). The deal was so good, I looked up the flight and hotel separately which highlighted the hotel being more than the package deal (if booked separately). The only complaint I have here is that I could only choose the standard room through AAVacations, no harm no foul though.\r\nAfter checking in and handing over the voucher we were checked in and given access to the Standard 2 Double bedroom. Since it wasn\'t just myself traveling we inquired about the availability of a room with 2 bathrooms (one level upgrade). Unfortunately, there were no rooms left. However, instead of just saying no the agent referred us to check back when we woke up in the morning to check if anything opened up for us. Unfortunately, nothing was available (Knitting convention in town) but I really appreciate the front desk\'s attempt!\r\nThe room was, as per usual, excellent! Our room was a fair size and looked out onto Monroe Street. The beds are extremely comfortable, didn\'t really miss my own bed at home during our stay! We were high enough from street level to avoid most of the noise (except for the occasional rumble of an L train that would quickly scoot by. The bathroom was a bit snug but that was expected for a hotel in the loop. The amenities provided by the hotel were excellent!\r\nThere\'s not much more to say. The hotel is everything that the other reviews say it is. The lobby is elegant, the rooms are nice, and the staff are very helpful. I would again highly recommend this hotel again to anyone. You will definitely not be disappointed!'
5,'The Palmer House Hilton is a GREAT hotel located in city center of the great city of Chicago, IL!','History is what it\'s all about - the historic ambience of the property is reflected throughout the entire hotel. Beautiful and magnificient decore from the elegant lobby to all 23 floors of guest rooms make it a special experience during ones stay. Although in the heart of a big city, the staff is extremely friendly, courteous, respectful and welcoming from the valet parking attendants and doormen upon arrival, to the personal attention of front desk check-in, lounge attendants, concierge to chamber maids. The Palmer House has recently completed an extensive renovation which has resulted in beautiful up to date amenities and high-tech services. Located in the heart of Chicago\'s Loop, the hotel is very convenient to all public transportation for visits to theatre district, museums, etc. Staying at the Palmer House is an exciting experience which is enhanced by a mixture of domestic and international travelers who make it their choice of hotel. Security is excellent as well as food service within the hotel. The GREAT Palmer House is my home away from home when in Chicago thanks to the caring, personal service I am privilaged to receive from the staff on the 23rd floor - Jolanta, concierge; lounge staff Oscar, Albana, Earnie; and Joyce, chamber maid. The in-house fittness center is great too including steam room and the many, many other amenities the hotel offers at a great value! Thank you Palmer House!!!'
5,'The Palmer House Hilton is the BEST place to be in Chicago, IL','The Palmer house has everything - elegance, history, superb accommodations, great professional and friendly staff, excellent location with access to easy public transportation to all parts of the city, health and fittness facilities, as well as great restaurants and shops and in-house parking facilities if you\'re driving in. And, if the guests you\'re staying among are important to you then you\'ll definately like the hotel which caters to national as well as international crowds which makes stays there interesting and exciting.\r\nThe Palmer House is my home away from home when in the city - wouldn\'t think of staying anywhere else. Try the Executive Level for an even greater experience!'
5,'The GREAT Palmer House, icon of Chicago','If you care about who you sleep with then you should stay at the Palmer House. Being among international guests only helped to make my recent stay all the more exciting. An impecabbly courteous staff, well appointed rooms, great public areas and full service facilities within the hotel make for a most enjoyable stay of what more could one ask for? And, there\'s more, location, location, location - excellent - in the heart of the loop convenient to public transport such as trains, busses and taxis. Convenient parking too in the hotels own indoor garage. The historic ambience makes the Palmer House a true gem!'
5,'Don\'t stay at the Chicago Palmer House Hilton','Don\'t stay at the Chicago Palmer House Hilton if you\'re just looking for a place to sleep! But if but if you want an enjoyable experience this icon of Chicago is just the ticket. Most stunning, of course, is the hotel in the heart of town - in the heart of the Loop. From here you can enjoy the city - walk to magnificient Millenium Park or to the shores of Lake Michigan or to wonderful summer festivals that are held on the lake front and Grant Park or to some of the great shopping emporiums located here. If going some distance from the hotel, trains and busses are easy and accessible and the friendly folk of the CTA will help you get to where you may want to go.\r\nInside the hotel, the recent restoration was an exacting effort that knew when to reproduce yesteryear and when to leave things alone. In some hands, for instance, the magnificent lobby might have been gutted and converted. Here it remains as it was originally designed with gold guildings and original Tiffany candleabras and lighting. The rest of the hotel also toes closer to comfort and luxury. Rooms are clean and well appointed. It all merges somewhere between elegant and cozy as one is reminded at every turn in this jewel that Potter Palmer gave to his new bride, Bertha - her crowning jewel.\r\nA full service hotel in every way from fittness center to great restaurants to newly opened in-house under ground parking facilities to great and friendly service staff at your every beck and call.\r\nIn truth, even if you\'re just looking for a place for a good nights\' sleep ... or to get away from it all (you really never have to leave the hotel if you don\'t want to - it\'s all right there) you need a night (or several) to fully appreciate the Palmer House and soak up the detail. Besides, when there\'s only one Palmer House in the world it becomes more than a place to stay. It becomes an experience.'
5,'Hidden Gems & Extraordinary Objects','The historic Palmer House Hilton Hotel itself is a gem in the heart of the great city of Chicago - within embodying luxurious appointments, superb service and magnificence which abounds at every turn. However, there is more than that to discover within these hallowed halls - there are extraordinary objects and stories about those gems that posses both symbolism and power.\r\nWhere do these extraordinary objects and gems come from, to whom do/did they belong, and how can hotel guests and visitors discover them? ... one finds them by discovering a relatively unknown jewel which shines as a beacon hidden in an upstairs room - the light emanates from the office of the hotel curator, a gem in its own smock! Highly recommended - take time to indulge in a most interesting historic tour of this great hotel hosted by the worthy hotel historian, Mr. Ken Price. To schedule a tour, inquire with the Concierge. It is well worth the time! And (keep your fingers crossed), as a fare well surprise the hotel\'s French Pastry Chef may appear and graciously offer a sample of Bertha Palmer\'s renouned brownies. You\'ll learn why this Chicago icon of the Palmer House came up with this heavenly recipe. Enjoy!!'
4,'A wonderful night in the city of chicago suburbians','otter Palmer built the hotel 137 years ago as a gift to his wife, Bertha Honore. Since then, it has been burned down (Chicago Fire) and undergone multiple owners and renovations. Currently, it is undergoing another face lift and we just got back from a quick one night trip there. We got the hotel through priceline so we paid under $100 for the night. \r\nThe hotel is huge (over 1600 rooms). Our check in was easy and all staff we came in contact with was very nice. We stayed in a standard room (8th floor). \r\nThe exterior is definitely a mess as others mentioned but the lobby still looks great and the bar creates a nice feel to it. The hallways on the room floors have been redone completely. Square Frames hold soft focused b/w pictures of famous performers that once performed in the Empire Room back in the day. Extremely classy. Our room was large. The colors were bold (bright greens, reds, black and white, deep cherry woods). Nothing bad to say about the decor inside the room. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were great. There was a desk with an internet connection (believe it was an extra) and another lounge chair with an ottoman. \r\nThe bathroom was small. There was a bowl sink which was a nice touch and i think they kept the former floor and wall tile. We did have hot water (noticed that was mentioned) however the fixtures for the shower were old and the water pressure was sub-optimal. The tolietries were Crabtree and Evelyn and were ample and pleasant smelling. There were plenty of towels.\r\nThe TV was a small tube tv that was very far away from the bed (one of the minuses of a large room) and they also had Figi Water to intice you but it was $6.50 per bottle. (Hint: stop at the CVS across the street for snacks)\r\nWe ordered room service for breakfast and it was nice. Overpriced but very good food. We did not eat at the Lockwood so not sure how that was even though it was advertised a lot. \r\nThe hotel is in a great area of visitors who want to do shopping downtown, see shows and be close to Millenium Park. State Street shopping is a must along with a visit to the bean. \r\nFinally, I noticed they are adding a lot of amenities to compete with new build hotels (flat panel tv with announcements, kiosks to check in to your flight with printer, trendy bar that is being built and complete renovation of the fitness center). \r\nI will admit, i am a sucker for places with rich history so the hotel already won me over with that. I have stayed here over 10 years ago and remember my experience being pleasant but this past one was definitely above average. I wouldn\'t say this is a family focused hotel however the rooms are big enough for a few kiddies on rollaways without you tripping on them. There was nothing that was negative about the stay HOWEVER, the amenities that are being renovated take away from a full Upscale experience. As we only stayed a night (and live in the Chicago Burbs), these werent a must but someone visiting this city for a longer stay, i can see how not having them can impact your trip.'
4,'Great stay but remember: old hotels will have small bathrooms','Overall a great stay at the Palmer House. Love the elegance of the lobby and the history about the hotel and it\'s originators (the Palmers). \r\nWe hotwired the room for $120 and got a double bed oversize room. It was nice, bathroom very small but the room was spacious. two nice chairs, ottoman and nice sized desk. The maid service was kind enough to help us with additional bedding as our son made a bed out of the chairs and ottoman. \r\nthe room was recently renovated so everything was new. nice darkout drapes, comfy beds and nice linens. this hotel is perfectly located for travelers wanting to be without a car and definitely would recommend. i have Heard there are some older rooms that haven\'t been renovated. make sure you get a new one!'
4,'Beautiful Building','This hotel is located in a beautiful building, in downtown Chicago. My room was HUGE: had 2 beds and lots of free space. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast was buffet style, very good but expensive. The hotel was all booked for the marathon so it was a bit chaotic and the staff was busy and did not deliver a very attentive service. Although the hotel is located in a central area close to the park and the Art Institute, the area around the hotel is not the nicest.'
4,'Second time, great again!','I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for the second time during the marathon. Service was more attentive, and I did not get the chaotic feeling I got last year. The room was good, although smaller than before, the bathroom was a joke: so small I felt I could barely move in there. I don\'t think a large person could have used it. The concierge was great and so helpful, specially Philippe. I hadn\'t realized that the rooms could be so far away from the elevator - must request a room closer next time. Overall great experience, as expected in a Hilton brand hotel.'
4,'Beautiful upgrade','Myself and my 2 children (aged 3 and 11) were upgraded to this hotel as our travel agents messed up our other booking.\r\nWe stayed for two nights.\r\nSpacious rooms with 2 double beds. The hotel has been totally renovated so the facilities were clean and in keeping with the age/style of the hotel. Nice toiletries in the bathroom and plenty of towels.\r\nWe ordered room service which came quickly but as usual was expensive\r\nBreakfast not included but we ate at a couple of the local cafes outside the hotel. There are a couple of cafes etc in the hotel incuding starbucks.\r\nConcierge was helpful. Bellstaff quick\r\nGreat location to catch the open air tours, easy to walk to the main attractions, close to millenium park'
3,'increasingly disappointing','Hilton is my preferred hotel chain wherever I travel and the Palmer House Hilton used to be my favourite hotel when I visit Chicago two or three times a year. I had not chosen to stay at the Palmer House for my last few visits, but this time I received my room highly discounted through a blind booking service.\r\nThe location is ideal, within walking distance to many tourist destinations and there is a red line stop right outside. The hotel really is awe-inspiringly beautiful, and offers modernly appointed, very clean rooms with amazingly comfortable beds and linens. There are great restaurant choices all around the block, and discounted self parking directly across the street.\r\nAnd while those good points have not changed, there is now a glaring and growing fault. The guest service has been on a downward slide for the past few years and this visit did nothing to encourage me that there is a positive change on the horizon. On a previous visit (two years ago) I had a very unpleasant encounter with a concierge, but dismissed it as an isolated exchange, until my next visit (six mos later) when the representative checking me out was more interested in placing his coffee order than completing my transaction. On my most recent visit I was blatantly ignored by the person working the HH members desk when I attempted to check in. I stood in front of him for no less than five minutes while he continued to silently stare ahead at a monitor. I was in no hurry and could have waited longer, but he didn\'t acknowledge me at all, so I went to the reception desk. Doug, the representative that registered me, was wonderful. He was professional, friendly, welcoming and even upgraded my room. When I returned later to thank him, I believe he genuinely remembered me, and if he didn\'t, it speaks well to his aptitude that I thought so anyway! Unfortunately, even his adroitness wasn\'t enough to change my opinion, as excellent customer service at a four star hotel should be the rule, not the exception. \r\nOverall, there are many other comparable hotel choices in the Loop/Mile for the same money that offer a consitently higher level of customer service.'
4,'History,Clean Rooms, Nice Staff','So the location of this hotel cannot be beat. You are right by millennium park (the bean), great restaurants, and the train is right outside which made it super convenient to go and catch a game at Wrigley. The lobby is gorgeous and I suggest enjoying a cocktail at the bar to sit and absorb its beauty. The elevators come quickly which I was worried about in an older hotel. Our room was very clean and the service was superb. The only downside is that the bathroom is extremely small, so small that you do not want to close the door while in there. Additionally the room does not have a fridge or even a coffee maker (I suggest going to Intelligentsia Coffee at 53 east Randolph Street to get your fix). So this will be a place to rest your head but not eat or enjoy coffee.'
2,'Hilton, are you listening? Palmer House has issues!','I have stayed in this historic grand hotel several times, in December of various years, in conjunction with attendance at a conference in Chicago. I have stayed here the past three Decembers, about five nights each time. This time was the deal-breaker for me ... no more Palmer House!\r\nFirst of all, I want to know where the Palmer House gets off charging guests for WIRED internet, at the scandalously high rate of $18/day? You can\'t use your laptop in the bed. The service drops without warning and can be quite slow.\r\nSecondly, could you perhaps renovate and make the bathrooms any smaller? Seriously, anyone over about 180 pounds would have to squeeze and scrunch to fit into the bathroom I had on the tenth floor.\r\nWhere is the coffee pot now? I realize the mini bar has been gone for several years (I never use those) but how about SOMETHING in the way of amenities? Nothing very grand about what I had in my room.\r\nThe carpet had a disgusting stain on it, and I was actually able to make it less dark by doing a little scrubbing. Housekeeping? Anyone there?\r\nThe room had a tube TV and the hotel receives about 15 channels, most of which are of focused interest. How about some TYLand, TBS, AMC, maybe an alternative to the single HBO channel?\r\nAnd lastly, watch out if you order room service. Read the fine print on the menu ... they want 15.4\% state and city tax, a $4.95 service charge for delivery, and if after 11pm, an *additional* 18\%. Thus, a $15 hamburger quickly become $30. Buyer beware. And the food is so-so, at best. Skip the fat- and cholesterol-laden breakfast bar. 22 bucks (+ a host of taxes) for that glop? No thanks. (And no wonder I never saw anybody in there at breakfast.)\r\nI\'ve stayed in Holiday Inns, Marriotts, and even a Days Inn in the Loop or River North areas that had more bang for the buck.\r\nBye, bye, Palmer House. Never again!'
2,'Shame on me for staying here yet again','I reviewed the Palmer House in Dec 2009. Sorry to report that my opinion has now been downgraded. There is no service in this hotel whatsoever. The front desk was condescending and did not care one bit about my promised upgrade. No bell staff. No concierge, just a vacant desk with some brochures scattered on it. Internet is now $20/day. My room was so forlorn, with furnishings right out of the 1970s or 1980s, worn carpet, DIRTY towel, hair in the tub, no amenities whatsoever, not even a coffee pot, and the same tired TV channel offerings. Workers were picketing over union affairs at all three entrances and banging trash can lids and hubcaps together - all night. Real nice touch there, Palmer House Hilton. And you did nothing about it. Last time I will stay here and I strongly suggest others stay elsewhere. Plenty of nice hotels in the vicinity. Palmer House is a tragedy these days, I\'m afraid.'
5,'Perfect location, great service, lots of charm, GREAT fitness center','This is one of my favorite full service Hilton properties to stay at.\r\nLots of historic charm and they did a great job with the renovations in the lobby. The lobby area and bar are fantastic.\r\nI have stayed at this hotel many times and the staff is great. As a HH diamond, I never have a problem getting a checkout time as late as 4. If I am leaving after that, the staff has been great about letting me have exec. lounge access after or on the rare occassion I arrive earlier in the morning in the city, if my room isn\'t available I am always given lounge access.\r\nThe exec lounge is good for a domestic hilton and has a good selection and great staff. On weekends though it can be crowded at breakfast time if there are a lot of kids up there and it can be hard to find a table to sit at. \r\nThe fitness center is the best fitness center I have seen at any hotel. Very modern and lots of up to date equipment.\r\nLocation is very good. If you are coming from Midway the orange line stops less than a half block from the hotel, the Blue line from Ohare is only a couple blocks away, and union station is an easy walk as well. Cabs are plentiful in front of the hotel and it\'s a very easy to many attractions and shopping.\r\nThe hotel staff has always been great. Seeing it is impossible to check in on the exec floor since you need a keycard for access, I wish the dedicated diamond check in area was open on weekends and later during the week or they had a dedicated check in line for diamonds. The check in lines can be long at times and that would help speed up check in a lot faster for their more frequent guests.\r\nNoise can be an issue sometimes, but it is a very old hotel. Parking is also expensive if you have a car. \r\nThe weekend brunch downstairs is also very good.'
4,'Great historic hotel/Good to see they finally have WIFI','I love the location of this property and it\'s historic charm. I haven\'t been staying here as much as in the past with a couple other hilton properties in the area (The Wit and the Hilton Garden inn), but still enjoy my stays here and stayed there the weekend of 3/9 for a weekend getaway.\r\nHotel location is perfect. The Red and Orange lines are right outside the door and if you are using OHare, the Blue line takes only a couple minutes to walk to. Lots of stores and place to eat at that are a close walk and very convenient to most theaters in the loop.\r\nFitness center is the best of any hotel I have stayed at. As much variety of machines as most gyms and very clean and modern.\r\nOne thing I use to hate about this hotel was no wifi except in the lounge. They now have wifi in the rooms and it worked without any problems and was pretty fast. I like that the free code they give you works on more than one device so I was able to use both my phone and IPAD with it.\r\nThis was my first time staying there since Hilton Honors added suite upgrades to the benefits for diamond members. I had read reviews about some properties not honoring this benefit. Fortunately the Palmer House did and gave me a very nice suite upgrade to suite 11-150. Suite was large and quiet.\r\nI used the luggage storage service after checkout and the guys working when I retrieved my bags were great. I didn\'t think I would have enough time to get to the airport on the blue line seeing I was checking bags and was going to grab a cab and they assured me I had plenty time. They were right and saved me a lot on a cab, and the train ended up being faster than a cab would have been with the traffic backups at a couple spots.\r\nThe only thing I dont like about this property is how crowded the lounge always is at breakfast time. I usually just take the tray from under the icebucket up with me to the lounge and put breakfast food on it and go back to my room to eat. That can be a pain though if your room isn\'t in the elevator bank serving the 23rd floor and having to switch elevators. Other times it isn\'t difficiult to find a seat and it nice they are open most of the day for things like grabbing a soda or bottled water. During breakfast time though they REALLY need to enforce the T&C of the HHonors program of only the member and ONE guest being allowed access if they aren\'t on the executive floor to help keep congestion down.'
5,'This hotel is a must stay in Chicago!','I have stayed here severeal times before and on this occasion was the best! The receptionist on checking was excpetional so warm, polite and friendly. I was allocated a superb room. Was truly exceptional. Had the opportunity to use the Executive Lounge as a Hilton Honors Gold member. This was wonderful. The staff were always so polite and attentive, with one exception. The man behind the bar on Thursday and Friday, was rude and lacking any charm whatsoever, a complete contrast to his colleagues. This is a hotel I will certainly return.'
4,'The grand old Palmer House still has charm','I was in Chicago recently for a convention and stayed at the Palmer House. It was still a very nice hotel. I had stayed there many years ago. The rooms have been recently renovated so they seemed more modern. The lobby area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink from the Lobby Bar. The ceiling of the lobby is a beautiful piece of art. The staff seemed friendly. I did not have any problem while staying there. The rooms are a bit pricey. I would stay there again for a business trip. The location is great.'
5,'Heart of Chicago hotel is wonderful','I have stayed at this hotel before in the past. It is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Chicago. The bar area is gorgeous. The architecture is phenomenal. The room i stayed in was very comfortable and clean. The staff was very pleasant. I would come back again and again.'
5,'Beautiful classic hotel! Relive the grandeur of old!','While we had some concerns based on other reviews, the appeal of staying at a classic historical treasure won out. And we weren\'t disappointed!\r\nIf you stay here, make sure you slow down and take a moment to enjoy the beauty. The most obvious is the main lobby with the gorgeous mural on the ceiling. But all around you are smaller, more subtle works of art - various statutes, paintings, ornate fixtures, and ornate trim all over the place, inside and out. \r\nWe had a room on the top floor with a private elevator that only went to the top 2 floors (and the fitness center, I believe). So there were no long lines and not stops at all 23 floors. \r\nOur room on the executive level had two beds, two bathrooms and was very large. Everything was in great condition and clean. Even the rooms had touches of elegance - pay attention to the details everywhere, even on the lamps. We did not hear any noise from neighboring rooms at all. \r\nThe executive lounge was above average for a Hilton. Don\'t miss the original recipe brownie created right here at the Palmer House for dessert!\r\nWhile the hotel has been completely renovated, if you want a super-modern experience, go someplace else. But if you want to experience history in luxurious (for the day) setting, with all the modern conveniences thrown in - this is the place! Make sure you check out the hotel\'s website (not the Hilton one) to get the history before you go.'
5,'Second visit was even better than the first!','After a wonderful stay at the Palmer House last fall, when my wife and her two sisters decided to get together for a birthday celebration (husbands included, although it was touch and go for a while!), there was no hesitation in returning to the Palmer House. And we weren\'t disappointed!\r\nAs other reviews indicate, this is a wonderful, classic hotel. There is old-world luxury everywhere - certainly the mural on the lobby ceiling, but in many other details, as well. Don\'t pass it by too quickly - look for artwork everywhere, and elegant details in every things from lamps to furniture. \r\nThe early check-in went great - thanks to Jurgita at the front desk. We had three adjacent connecting rooms on the executive level. I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen 3 connecting rooms before - perfect for a group of 3 couples. The executive level is well worth the extra money. A private elevator to the top 2 floors is a nice treat! Plus a huge lounge, which was a great place just to hang out in between sight seeing. One of the lounge hosts, Ernest, was incredible. In addition to making us feel welcome and taking care of all our food and beverage needs, he\'s a wealth of knowledge about the area. The included breakfast was typical continental, but certainly adequate. The evening snacks could have been a full meal - two hot choices every night, plus fruit, veggies, cheese & crackers, etc. And the world-famous Palmer House brownies were available all day! As was fresh, hot coffee!\r\nThe location is perfect. Just steps from the Orange Line train from Midway Airport. Millennium Park and Grant Park are only a block away. Buses run frequently right in front of the hotel to take you wherever you want to go - Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, Museums. And a 3 day day transit pass is only $14! No need for a car here.\r\nThe rooms were in good shape, although the hotel is well over 100 years old. If you\'re looking for something brand new and modern, stay at the Holiday Inn Express along the freeway. If you\'re looking for a truly luxurious experience, stay at the Palmer House!'
2,'Mostly great','My family and I stay at the Palmer House every year for a conference. Last year was great. Not to say that this year wasn\'t, because it was. This year just had a few bumps that will not matter in a year.\r\nThe Palmer House is doing some major remodeling. They do not really have a hotel restaurant, which is a problem if you don\'t want to spend $25 on a children\'s cheeseburger and a Coke. No joke. For the conference in the past we would have to stand inside of the side doors of the hotel and wait for the busses to come. This year, those doors and that floor are being renovated so you have to go out the front of the hotel and around the side and stand in the extreme weather of Chicago. It was freezing cold and there was no shelter at all. The day we checked out we had to stand there for 40 minutes in blowing snow and freezing temperatures. The bellman took our bags and dropped them next to the street where we had to stand. He held his hand out though... they don\'t miss that. Which brings me to my next point. Upon checking in we encountered a bellman who we had to get from talking to the group of other bellmen so that he could get a cart, which was behind his stand. He grabbed our bags and slung them like he used to work for the airlines or something and then wheeled them iside the doors (about 10-15 feet) and said... Ok, this is as far as I go with your bags. He repeated this to me about 5 times before I realized he was asking for a tip. Each time he said it... he was less and less friendly. That was irritating since he really didn\'t do much and was so relentless about the tip when we clearing had just forgotten to give it to him... which we ended up doing once I realized what he was saying.\r\nThe high speed internet (which you have to pay for) was anything but high speed. It was like having dial up. Really bad. Also, to use the pool or workout facility... you have to pay. I think that\'s realy bad. Almost unheard of as well. \r\nThe rooms were fantastic. We were on the 25th floor and had adjoining rooms to the rest of the family. Housekeeping was great and the executive level was awesome. The showers in the room were so wonderful that I honestly looked forward to my showers and could stay in there long enough that I turned into a prune. They were GREAT! We are actually going to buy the same shower head for our bathroom. The beds were like sleeping on clouds. No kidding. They were amazing and cozy. \r\nThe concierge on the executive level named Alegra was GREAT! I can\'t say enough about her. She was extremely helpful and very very nice. \r\nWe also had a fantastic experience with a gentleman named D.T. who works at the hotel in reservations. He went far above the call of duty to ensure us that we would have the rooms we needed. Without him... the experience may not have been as glowing! He was great!\r\nOverall, the hotel was perfectly fine. The only issues were the bellmen, internet, pool and the outside doors. Honestly... if that\'s all there is to complain about... that\'s pretty good.'
2,'Not what it used to be','This was my 5th (and probably final) time staying at the Palmer House. My family and I stay here the week after Thanksgiving every year. There is a very large medical conference that a family member of mine participates in and my husband and I join for some exra time we would not otherwise get with the family. \r\nMy first few years I was highly impressed with the Palmer House and it\'s offerings. At the price we were paying, I would expect to be impressed. Even last year amidst all of the renovations (which were only extensive to the street level and pool/spa) it was still impressive. \r\nWe always stay on the Executive Level because of our status with Hilton Hotels (HHonors). On this level you need a special key to access the floor and it\'s executive lounge. In the lounge (in years past) we were greeted with a nice amount of options, both hot and cold, for breakfast. Large bagles, fruit, hot oatmeal, fresh bread, eggs or something similar and wonderful Douwe Egberts coffee, Tazo teas, hot chocolate and a fridge full of sodas and juice. All free for the taking. This year there were no hot offerings, not even packets of oatmeal. Only toast, small bagles, small dried up muffins and pastries. The coffee has been switched to Lavazza (which sucks), the soda is still available but they are small bottles. The small botles were not the bad part as they are still a good amount. The problem is that in the week I was there, I was never able to open a bottle. I did not see one woman able to open a bottle the entire time. Not even the bar tender. I was told by an employee in the executive lounge that they cut-backs were made because of the economy. That... I can understand. Read further.\r\nPart of the new renovation is the spa and pool. The pool is average but by no means looks like it has been remodeled. Not to mention you have to walk and walk and walk down all types of back hallways past conference rooms to even find the pool. Odd since they frown upon you wearing a swimsuit around the guests. Not sure how to get from your room to the pool otherwise. Maybe that\'s why theer was never anyone at the pool the whole time I was there during a week the hotel was completely sold out. \r\nWhich is another point. There were NUMEROUS things that the hotel has cut-back on to save a dine here and there but the price of the closet size, paper thin walls have gone up. My king size bedroom closet size room was $221 a night. They have taken all of the coffee makers out of the room (which they had installed brand new the very week I was there last year). Even a budget hotel offers a coffee maker in the room. They said this was part of the cut-back. So, now you are forced to buy their coffee from room service, which we did one night. 2 cups of decaf = $14 plus a tip. Did I mention that if you are one of the lucky few to get executive level status, there is no decaf? I had to call and ask why there was no decaf because the employees of the exec. lounge just said it\'s not offered every time I asked. It was eventually brought up the last 2 days of my stay. \r\nThe concierge recommended a restuarant called Tavern at the Park which is just next to Millenium Park our first night there. But my husband and I received a healthy dose of food poisoning. I don\'t recommened this place to eat. The second day, a couple moved into the room next to us. As mentioned above, the walls in the hotel are seriuosly paper thin. The couple began having sex at 5pm on Sunday and didn\'t stop until 7am on Monday. They were anything but quiet. I tried knocking on the wall, slamming my door, slamming a closet door (which they also did frequently) and at 5am I called security and told them to handle it before I did. The couple quieted down from 5:30-6 when they picked up where they left off. Security stated that they have done alll they can do. Now we are talking two nights with no sleep. I did go to the front desk the next morning and complained. They happily moved us to another floor and a bigger room. We were told it was a 2 bed, 2 bath. It would have been had the second bath not been under construction. \r\nTo conclude this long review (and I could certainly go on and on)... if you are new to the Palmer House, you will not know anything is wrong (except the rooms were absolutely freezing the whole time). If you are a returning guest... you will most definately notice some serious changes.'
5,Perfect,'We stayed at the Palmer House for the 4th time this month and really recommend it as a fantastic place to stay in Chicago. As Hilton Honours Diamond Members we were upgraded to the 23rd Floor which is their Tower/Executive floor. The room was big (with 2 bathrooms) and was beautifully furnished and maintained. Celina at the Hiltons Honours Desk was so welcoming and most helpful again during this stay. All the staff indeed were very accomodating. \r\nAs mentioned by the previous reviewer, renovations are underway in this hotel at present, these although did not in any way interupt our stay at the Palmer House. \r\nThe Airport Express bus leaves the Palmer House every 15mins throughout the day, which gives an alternative, more economical transportation choice over using cabs. We found the cab drivers (certainly the ones we encountered) very rude and ignorant in this city!!\r\nA classic, traditional hotel, with good old fashioned service and values. We will return!!!!'
5,'Great hotel, great service fab lobby','We stayed in this impressive landmark hotel for 2 nights on Hilton points so can\'t comment on value normally. We found all the staff really helpful and because we are Hilton diamonds we were upgraded so our room was spacious. The use of the executive lounge with its beverages and snacks was most welcome! A really well run lounge. We took the tip from another reviewer and got the train from the airport it was great 2 dollars 25 cents was great value but b watch out they don\'t give change. We ate at the Flat top grill on Wabash near hotel a make your own stir fry bar - good food. The lobby in the Palmer House is so ornate and is so impressive. I will return again'
5,'Love this hotel!!!','LOVE THIS HOTEL!! We stayed here on business, after I\'d stayed here a couple months ago for the first time. The hotel is a GREAT location, and the front desk staff is wonderful. I had requested a particular room because I\'d previously stayed in the room w/my husband, and the hotel honored my request. If we had any questions, they were very friendly and happy to help.\r\nThe hotel room is extremely clean, and a little small, but that is to be expected in NY City. I had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building, which is well within walking distance from the hotel. Times Square is also within walking distance. If you don\'t care to do the walking, the subway station is literally right around the corner. \r\nThis hotel is and always will be the first hotel I check when I am visiting NY. I recently stayed in NY, and the hotel was sold out. The other hotel I stayed in significantly paled by comparison. The New Yorker Hotel is a great hotel, with a great location and fantanstic staff. What more can you ask for?'
5,'Loved it again and we\'ll be back!!','My husband and I stayed here again (our third stay), and really enjoyed it. The last time we were at this hotel was in October 2007. The hotel appears fully renovated now.\r\nThe staff is very warm, welcoming and helpful. The staff member assisting us at check-in was extremely friendly and personable. The room was very clean, and had a wonderful view of the harbor, Empire State Building, and the overall city. The room temperature could be controlled by us, and with the humidity in NY in July, we enjoyed the a/c. \r\nThe hotel location is great, with subways A, C and E literally right around the corner. It\'s also within easy walking distance of Times Square (about ten blocks) and a little farther to the Empire State Building. I have also stayed at the hotel for business in the past, and will return for business and family vacations. Have no hesitations strongly recommending this hotel to singles, couple, groups, business travelers and families.'
4,'Nice hotel at a perfect location','We did a city trip to NY in January and stayed 2 nights at the New Yorker. It was a short but excellent stay. \r\nThe location is perfect, we arrived in the city center with the train at Penn Station which is under Madison Square Garden. The hotel is just around the corner.\r\nThe room was renovated, very small, but clean and the bed was very good. The staff was very helpful and we could leave our bags for a small fee in the baggage room near the reception.\r\nYou can walk from the hotel right into the Tick Tock Diner where we had an excellent breakfast. The prices at the Diner are really ok, considering the portions you get.\r\nNext time we book the New Yorker Hotel again, just the place you need for a city trip.'
4,'I love this hotel','We stayed here before, but this time we brought the kids as well and stayed 4 nights. The location is perfect, next to Penn Station, great connection to the airport as well as the subway system to get around in NY.\r\nThe room wasn\'t too big and the view could be better, but hey that\'s not the reason why you\'re in Manhattan. The room was clean, the bed was confi and there was a flatscreen. There\'s also free wifi in the room. \r\nThe first morning we had breakfast in the TikTok Diner, but it\'s not as good anymore as it used to be. Burned toast, poor service etc... The rest of our stay we had breakfast around the corner on 34th Str direction 9th Ave, self service but very good quality at reasonable prices. \r\nWould definitely stay again at the New Yorker!'
4,'Can\'t wait to go back','Have just spent 5 nights in New York and it was everything peoplesaid it would be. Loved the buzz of the place and all the attractions. The New Yorker Hotel had a great location, the rooms were clean, if a little on the small side (but fine as it was just for sleeping in},the hotel staff were friendly and polite. We liked the security of asking for room keys to be shown before accessing the lifts.The Tick Tock Diner below the hotel is highly recommended, particularly for breakfasts. Will definitely be returning.'
4,'Return visit','Have just come back from 2nd trip to New York again staying at the New Yorker Hotel with my 16 y.o. daughter. This time had 2 doubles and found the room to be a good size, clean and well serviced by the maid\'s.Staff in the reception and concierge areas were all very pleasant and helpfull at all times. Again it is an excellent base to explore the city. Used the Tick Tock Diner regularly and whilst the food is still excellent the quality of service compared to a year ago was not as good. The female staff, who are the minority, were a lot more attentive than their male counterparts, although the 2 female floor supervisors(I think that is what they were) who guided you to your tables could have looked a bit more interested in what they were doing and smiled a bit more, it all appeared a bit of chore to them.'
4,'Handy for Macy\'s','We stayed for 3 nights in the hotel before transferring by train from Penn Station to DC. Station is 150m from hotel and next to the metro so is very convenient. Many of the sights can be easily walked to if the weather is not too hot! Hotel is clean and cosy, would be especially lovely in winter. We had a family room with 2 double beds so there was plenty of space, bathrooms were well appointed. No fridge or Tea making facilities in the room although ice was available. No valuables were to be left in the room which was OK, however the free safety deposit boxes were at reception.\r\nThere are plenty of cafes / bakeries for a morning snack nearby and a 24 hour pharmacy and grocery store across the road. We only used the Tick Tock Diner once for brunch, we ordered 2 breakfasts and extra toast which was more than adequate for 3 of us.\r\nWe found New York busy and quite expensive, we bought a city pass for entry into 6 attractions which was good. We managed to do the Empire State Building at 8.15am and had no queue at all, the top of the Rock was equally fine at 7pm, just in time for sunset.'
4,'Just as good as last time','We have just shared a visit to the New Yorker with Hurricane Irene! Hotel was great and handled the situation well. Central New York was unaffected except by closure of the transportation system. The hotel was very calm and organised and we felt very safe. The room we had was a twin and was large by New York\'s standards with a great view of The Empire State Building. There are no tea making facilities in the room, but you can buy a coffee and pastry in the lobby. We used the tick Tock Diner a couple of times and it was fine and well priced. Over the street from the hotel is a Duane Reade pharmacy selling water and snacks. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. The hotel is ideally situated for Penn Station which is within easy walking distance even with luggage.'
4,'Fabulous midtown location','This place is all about the convenience of an excellent midtown location. Rooms are small but clean. My room seemed as if it had recently been update. I would consider this a 3 star hotel.'
4,'Impressed with customer service.','First off the location is fabulous. The hotel is a short walk to Javits & Times Square. The subway & Penn Station are right out the door. The rooms are small, but clean w/ fresh paint and furniture that is not warn and tired. The rooms are not smaller that what is typically found in Manhattan. Congrats and thank you for having shower caps in the room. Unfortunately no coffee makers. The staff at the hotel was terrific. Every chambermaid greeted me with s hello. Electricians held elevator doors when they were on my floor. I am not used to all staff being so accommodating. A special call out to Suzie the concierge. This woman was a wealth of information and very helpful. Congrats New Yorker. You get high marks.'
5,'Sweet Suite for Westminster 2010','Better late than never? I\'ve stayed here before and will again..and I\'ll give *that* review in a more timely manner. The hotel is well-kept, the staff are efficient, beds are super comfy. I\'d booked a room for 2 and we suddenly found ourselves with 3 women and a large dog.... a cot would not work in the room we booked so I wasn\'t looking forward to the 2 night stay *that* much. Well, the New Yorker came through and salvaged my stay...the upgraded us to a very nice suite that easily slept 3 with no beds needing to be shared -- hurrah! Room Service from the Tick-Tock was fast and delicious. \r\nLocation is ideal -- 1 block to MSG/Penn Station, walkable to Times Square, Broadway, Macy\'s etc. Hotel is historic... and the renovations made since my last stay are truly lovely.'
5,'Westminster Gem.... once again','2011 -- a trip booked rather last minute on priceline for an amazing (considering the dates) price.\r\nMetro room, partial view of Empire State and Chrysler buildings. Ended up with two queen beds for the view \r\n(I\'d wanted a king, but didn\'t want to switch rooms). Clean crisp linens, lovely toiletries in a handy container, clean room, pretty quiet....well, except for the Yorkies next door who liked to yap at 5am, thanks. \r\nA few meals at the Tick Tock, good food, fast service, reasonable prices...and the convenience of 24 hours. Again, checkin/out was ok, wish they had in-room safes as storing my computer at the front desk safes was a bit of a hassle, but I was always met with a smile...and that goes a long way.\r\nRenovations are now complete throughout the hotel and it shows. Overall my favorite NYC hotel for mid-town and my only choice for Westminster -- the Hotel Pennsylvania is a bit closer, but having seen the rooms, I\'ll take the New Yorker, thanks.'
4,'Great hotel','Hotel is in a great location. Staff are really friendly, the housekeeping staff are great.\r\nUntil we arrived to check in no body had advised of a $300 security deposit, luckily we had a credit card.\r\nTick Tock diner is not great, prices are high and the service is very very slow.\r\nTry the Stage Door diner one block up, much better.\r\nWe had a great time in NYC, the New Yorker is so central it is wonderful for a sight seeing tour of the City.'
4,'Check in - be warned','Having stayed at the New Yorker 2 years ago and having a problem at check in, I E mailed prior to our arrival to check the booking & confirm our ETA. Booking was confirmed, check in time is from 3pm. All good, we arrived at 3.15 pm, queued only to be told there was no trace of our booking, desite showing them the E mails and the booking confirmaiton from our travel agent, so I had to give all the names in our party, at last success our booking was traced, but only 1 room was ready, don\'t worry, come back at 4pm and it will be ready!, so off we went, returning at 4.15, queued again, couldn\'t find our booking again, went through it all only to be told that one of the rooms still wasn\'t ready, and they couoldn\'t tell me when it could be ready. I was offered 3 options. I could check in 1 room, and wait, change one room to another floor, or change both rooms to another floor, I opted to move both room. So eventuallty we got our keys, we went to our rooms, one room was lovely, but the other room was small, and dark. But after travelling for about 12 hours we decided to get started on our holiday, but this delay really caused us some stress. Talking to other people this problem with check in is not unusual, most people seem to have a problem. It is a shame as this hotel is lovely, it is in a fantastic location, but check in is a nightmare, the staff do not appreciate that most guests have travelled some distance to get there, and why say there is a 3pm check in if rooms are not ready, saying that, when we got to our rooms they were very clean, so maybe that is why it takes so long.'
5,'Excellent Location/Value','Clean, friendly and great central location if you wish to see New York. If you are planning on spending a lot of time in your room you should possibly look elsewhere as the rooms are quite small. Beds were very comfortable, bathroom clean. Look for a room on the upper floors as there can be a bit of noise out on the street during the night. The city just has that buzz about it.'
4,'Nice Hotel, Nice Location','This is a review that I should have submitted at the end of February when we returned from New York. Stayed at the New Yorker with my wife and two children for two nights. This was our second visit to this hotel and we enjoyed our stay. I would have to agree with many of the comments regarding the size of the room, with four of us in our room it was a tight squeeze. Having said that I think that small hotel rooms in New York are to be expected and you don’t travel to New York to sit in your hotel room. The room was tidy and suited our needs. \r\nWe had breakfast each morning in the Tick Tock Diner (entrance from the Lobby) and while quite busy the service was good. The breakfast set us up for the day. While I would have liked to travel out to dinner each evening this was not possible with two small children. Coopers Restaurant is a part of the hotel and we ended up dining there on both evenings. While the food and service is excellent we did dine here last year and I would like to have tried some new restaurants.\r\nThe hotel is in a great location, just yards from Penn Station and all major attractions.\r\nApart from a slight disagreement with the Bell Boy over our luggage just prior to our departure we had a very enjoyable stay and I would have to recommend this hotel.'
3,'Serves a purpose','We selected this hotel, as it was the staging ground for the Macy\'s Day Parade which we were in. I guess if you are a tourist it does have the advantage of being centrally located in a slightly seedy part of town ( especially at night) . The staff was accommodating, and allowed a late check out without a problem. The size of the room was TINY. I guess for the price I did expect something slightly bigger. We had a queen size bed, and there was about 2 1/2 feet of room on both sides of the beds. That was it. There is an ironing board but NO ROOM SAFE- which I thought was very odd. Bed was comfortable enough for one night. Bathroom was refurbished but tiny. They had all necessary toiletries. My biggest complaint though was the noise from the alley ways, and streets - and we were on the 23rd floor. My husband who could sleep through a hurricane complained about the noise level the next morning. \r\nThe hotel serves a purpose - It is clean enough and centrally located but I thought a bit expensive for what you actually received.'
3,'Room with a view','This is the 3rd year that we have gone back to the New Yorker Hotel because we are always in the Macy\'s Day Parade, and that\'s where it\'s staged from. I must say this year, while our room was its usual tiny self, the view from the 35th floor was great. The customary shampoo, conditioner, bath wash, and lotion were provided. Not sure if they always have someone posted at the elevators checking to see if you really are an occupant of the hotel, ( i know they do post one for parade related dates) but for worried travelers it\'s a nice touch. Did not eat there, or go to the bar area. Convenient location and inexpensive if you want the west side.'
3,'Nice Hotel and Great Staff','This is our 4th year returning to the New Yorker because we are in the Macy\'s Parade every year, and this is the staging ground for the parade. The room was the nicest yet. Room 2616 was a mini suite. While the hotel is old, and we didn\'t really have a view from our window, I don\'t think you can beat the price, or the location. The staff was welcoming NY style ;)'
4,'Great location, art deco, good value','Stayed for 6 nights. First room was too small and no view, so upgraded(extra $25 pn). This room was much bigger and had a view of Empire State Building. Worth the extra money. Staff were good and there is a fabulous 24hr diner Tick Tock adjoining where the staff and food were great.. Great location - you could easily walk to centre of Manhattan,a short walk to Macys and a subway station is just across the road.Loved the decor - the hotel is in a good area, has been modernised while keeping the look of the 20s. A great find.'
4,'Room with a view','We booked a room for a week at the New Yorker. We found it a well maintained, comfortable, clean \'art deco\' hotel in a safe and convenient part of Manhattan. The 24 hour diner attached was terrific. The room we were originally allocated was not suitable, cramped and no outlook, so we requested a change and for an extra $25pn we had a lovely room looking onto Empire State Building and NY skyline. We would stay there again.'
5,'Great location','This was a spur of the moment trip from D.C. to NY. We really had no idea where to stay but decided this one looked good. It truly was, the location was great. We actually rode the Bolt bus from DC & it dropped us off about a block from the hotel & then picked us up at same place, so that made it really convenient. We were able to walk to all the sights,never had to take a taxi or train. Others have commented on the size of the room & yes, it was small, but we only slept there so it was no problem. When we came in that evening we did have A/C issues, but called the front desk & it was taken care of very quickly. The concierge was extremely helpful. They have a good restaurant connected with the hotel Tick Tock Diner (I believe) which we had breakfast at and was pleased. We would definitely stay here again!'
5,'Another nice stay!','This was our 2nd stay here and we were more than pleased. We had requested a KING bed, but when we checked in the nice young man asked if we would prefer two full beds in a larger room & we said sure! When we got to the room we were amazed, it was so much larger than the one we had last time, actually a corner room, so quite the value. Just want to say again how great the location is to Broadway, we walked to Magestic Theatre with no problem. We will definitely stay here again!'
4,'Vintage Hotel, Great Service','First of all, we stayed at the hotel during the NY Comic Con when prices were way higher than we would normally spend in NYC, so I can\'t really comment on the value for the price. If the prices were competitive, I would definitely stay in this hotel again.\r\nBecause of the Comic Con, the hotel was VERY busy during our entire stay. Yet the staff served everyone quickly and with aplomb. We cringed at the long line to check our bags, but they had several staff working the check, and it took less time than it sometimes takes a bellman with no line to check our bags. The registration desk moved quickly and efficiently, yet maintained friendly service. We arrived too early to expect a room to be ready, but I guess our kids looked tired from our early morning train departure because the person at the desk found us a room that was almost ready and upgraded us as well! What a pleasant surprise. Even though the desk was swamped, the desk clerk, Reachell, found us when the room was ready. (Manager - please note that Reachell was great - one of the best hotel registration staff people I\'ve encountered in recent years.)\r\nWe had a suite, which was plenty of room. It is an old hotel, and I imagine the regular rooms are quite small by today\'s standards. Each of the two rooms in our suite was fairly small. The great thing about the suite was that it had a real solid door between the two rooms as well as a bathroom connected to each room, so if you were traveling with kids or people with different sleep schedules, you could share the suite easily without disturbing each other.\r\nThe rooms looked fresh in an art deco style in keeping with the building. Beds and furniture were comfortable. Everything is very solid - heavy doors, tile instead of cheap wrap-around in the tub, etc. The room was very quiet as well. I would have not an inkling that I was in the middle of Midtown Manhattan if I didn\'t peek out the window. The hotel was booked solid that weekend, but we heard nothing from above, below or beside us. \r\nThe location is great - a block from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, and an easy walk to both the Javitz Center and Times Square. Subways to almost anywhere you would want to go are a couple of blocks away. We were in Astoria, Queens in about 20 minutes by subway from the hotel (door-to-door).\r\nThis is not a new, sparking luxury hotel (although everything was very clean) with tons of amenities. Some people might be turned off by that. If you want the feel of early 20th century New York with some contemporary upgrades and great service, then this is the place for you. \r\nBy the way, we\'ve eaten at the Tic Tock Diner (connected to the hotel) on past visits to NYC. Although fine, we much prefer the deli (Stage?) on the corner a couple of blocks down from the hotel, and the service there is exceedingly quick if you don\'t have much time.'
4,'Worth returning: Comfortable and great location','We had booked our reservations online. We had gotten a pretty good rate, but when we arrived there, we were told the rate we had was a computer error and instead of $139, they had to charge us $199.\r\nWe weren\'t happy paying more for the same room, so management offered us a better room: newly renovated, on the top floor with a fabulous view. We were surprised to see we had a living room separate from the bedroom. The furnishings were really nice and all in Art Deco style. \r\nThe bed was really comfortable and to me, having a white duvet on the bed just reassures me that it IS clean. There were too many pillows on the bed to sleep in, but really useful for reading in bed.\r\nI really enjoyed my stay, I\'ll be back!'
2,'Don\'t book here if you value sleep.','I was really disappointed with my stay at the New Yorker. I was placed on the 20th floor next to a bunch of 30-something males having a party. They were loud from 8pm till 5am in the morning. Security was called twice (10pm and 3am) and we complained twice in person at front desk. \r\nTheir suggestion was to call the police. I didn\'t want to disturb their fun and only wanted to be moved to a quieter floor, next to the flight attendants. I had 3.5hours of sleep in total. \r\nThe decor is really nice, small and cozy. Wifi is really slow. I rented a movie on iTunes and it was going to take 3,600 hours to download. They didn\'t include soundproofing in their newly renovated rooms so if you value sleep, don\'t book there. You can hear simple conversations through the walls from another room.\r\nAlso, lower floors are dedicated to student housing. This hotel caters more to the party type than the quiet types. \r\nI left a comment on their Facebook page and Glenn (Manager) posted a response by saying to contact him directly via email. Sent an email & 48hrs later, no response.'
4,'Perfect location, I had a great view....','After 3 weeks driving across the USA our last few days were spent in NYC....me and the 2 kids aged 3 and 11.\r\nAll taxi drivers know the hotel so dont worry if you forget the address!!!!\r\nGreat location withi easy walking distance of time square, broadway, MAcys....all the important things!!!!\r\nOur room was teeny as you owuld expect in New York. It was beautifully decorated as it had recently been renovated. 2 double beds, a desk, tv and the smallest bathroom ever!\r\nNice toiletries inluded\r\nA teeny window with the most perfect view of the empire state building!\r\nRestaurant on ground floor open 24 hrs althougha bit pricey you get loads of great food and shakes!!'
4,'Perfect location every time','This was the second time I chose to stay at this hotel - price and location are the best!!\r\nWe checked in easily - luckily every taxi driver knows this location!!! Check in reception is busy but beuatifully ornate. We were given an upgrade to a bigger room but this did mean two beds rather than one\r\nThe room had little view of anything exciting but enough to remind me I was in NYC\r\nThe room was huge by NY standards, clean and everything required\r\nBathroom teeny tiny but again it has everything required\r\n3 great nights sleep!!!\r\nPerfect location so thats all the reason to stay!'
5,'Good value','Stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of Apr. Asked for a refurbished room with a view of the ESB and we got exactly as we asked for. Lovely clean room, spacious with 2 beds, 2 chairs with small table and chest of drawers and still enough room to walk around without banging legs on beds etc.. Check-in a little slow and would have preferred a safety deposit box in room instead of having to use one at reception but overall had pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone. Used Tick Tock diner for breakfast twice, good quality at decent price but was a bit put-off by the blatant tip request written on the check - it\'s a pet hate of mine in the US, I dont mind paying the tips but don\'t like to be asked.'
5,'Another great stay','Just had another great stay at this hotel. Cannot fault it at all, rooms fairly small but good for NYC and they are always clean and tidy. We always find the staff helpful and pleasant especially in the Tick Tock Diner, which does a very nice blueberry pancake!'
4,'Art Deco Elegance, Comfort, and Perfect Proximity for Train travelers','I don\'t usually care for bigger hotels, but the proximity to Penn Station/subway, government rate, and Art Deco elegance made up for it. Entrance to Penn Station is right across the street, and you really feel like you\'re in New York here. Beautiful lobby, nicely restored. Front desk is a little brisk, but that\'s to be expected in a large, busy hotel. Despite a lot of others arriving when we did, check-in was quick and painless, no trouble with our government rate either. \r\nOur room (29th floor) was exactly what I asked for. Not large, but we had a corner room with two exposures, so it didn\'t feel cramped, and we could bring in fresh air. Nice view overlooking 8th Avenue. Full-size, two sided closet was nice for two travelers. Iron/ironing board, and luggage stand were handy. Bathrooms are not large, but ours had a window! and was well equipped. Plenty of hot water. Comfortable beds. separate chair and desk were included. \r\nFurnishings are quite nice, authentic art-deco reproductions made the room feel elegant, as are the elevator lobbies. Someone has put a lot of tthought and work into to maintaining the character of the hotel, and it shows. Nick and Nora Charles would be at home here! Art deco enthusiasts (and even purists) will approve. \r\nWe didn\'t make it to Cooper\'s Tavern, but it looked like a nice spot for a drink, burger, etc. \r\nOur rate included a substantial continental breakfast Friday, at a 39th floor lounge with terrific views. Saturday included full breakfast at the Tick Tock diner. Large and busy, but service was quick/friendly, and food was very good. Get there early before lines get too long! \r\nConcierge desk was accomodating, and helped us locate Birdland. We checked our luggage before a 2 PM train, bell staff were friendly, took good care of my suitcases, and we had no delays. \r\nOverall, we had a nice experience, and would easily stay here again. If you dislike bland, chain hotels, and want a little elegant NY feel to where you stay, this is a great place. This location comes with a bit of a premium (not so much as Times Square though), but in this case, is well worth it.'
5,'fantastic location!','Just got back from my 1st visit to America,the hotel was great,just wished we had been told that we had to pay a $300 deposit on the room which was refunded on day of departure,ok you get it back but we had to use some of our spending money to pay,didnt take a credit/debit card with me,they told us our company should have said,(thomsons). The location was great,5 mins to macys,15 to empire state building,plenty of places to eat around the hotel,also the taxi from newark was expensive,we were given a receipt with $65 wrote on for our journey inc tolls etc,but got charged $83,so just paid and put it down to experience. Will stay here again when i hopefully visit New York next year.'
5,'GLAD TO BE BACK!','Me and my sister have just returned to the New Yorker for a 5 day stay,we got the same room as last year which was massive,2 large queen beds overlooking the hudson river,large flat screen in the room,i emailed before we travelled and asked if there was any chance of an upgrade,emailed straight back and said we could have same room! We like this hotel due to its location,5 minute walk from Penn station,10 minute walk to bus station (we used the train to get from Newark $12.50,and the newark airport bus to get back $15.00),both of these were easy use and so much cheaper,cost us $85 in a taxi last year! The location is great,5 minutes to Macys,10 minutes to Times Square,10 minutes to 5th Avenue,Maddison Square gardens is across the road,across the road is Mc donalds,burger king,wendys and plenty of cheap places were the locals eat,we used these,great food and very cheap. The hotel has great security,need to show pass before using the lifts, a $300 deposit is required when checking in either by card or in dollars,when checking out can leave your bags in storage for a dollar a bag until time to leave for your flight home. Some reviews sound so bad,i can only say i have been twice and if i return to New York this will be my choice again,excellent.'
5,'Outstanding hotel, great value for location!','This hotel was fabulous! One of my favorite things about it was the art deco style, classic old New York city glamor! We traveled August 18 &19th. We were upgraded to a suite that had a terrace with a view of the Empire state building. Cannot recomend the location highly enough, especially if you are coming into the city via a connection to Penn Station. I cannot describe how nice it was to not have to drag luggage on and off the subway AT ALL. VERY convinient to the subway (a station right below). They also gave us a free breakfast which was perfect! Rooms were very clean and a very nice neighborhood. Have stayed in times square before, but this was better (and cheaper) less road noise, and no lights flashing in your window all night. Nice and quiet with comfortable beds. Two thumbs way up!'
4,'Ideal for arrivals via Penn Station. Great location, great view.','This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. We were upgraded to a view room (room 3717), which had spectacular views of the skyline, including the Empire State Building and the Crysler building. The room was small, but I was there to sight-see, not lounge in my hotel room - and the location and view made up for the small size anyway! \r\nWe arrived via Penn Station, so we only had a very short walk to the hotel with our luggage. Our room wasn\'t ready, but it was before check-in time, so this wasn\'t unexpected. The staff was curteous and helpful, checking our luggage and giving us some directions. When we checked out, the bell staff even checked a flower in a small vase for us while we finished our sight-seeing.\r\nHint: This is a VINTAGE hotel. Expect it to be older (smaller elevators, rooms, etc.) It is well maintained and has a lot of character. I personally prefer a vintage feel. Beautiful grand chandelier in lobby.\r\nMy only small complaint is that the bathroom could use some renovation, as the tile grout is stained, which doesn\'t give the impression of spotlessly clean. That said, the room (including the bathroom) was very clean and comfortable. We all slept very well!'
4,'Location is Great','We picked the New Yorker because of reviews & recommendation. It did not get of to a very good start with the Front of House member of staff having an attidude of I don\'t care .\r\n My husband was due to come on the 6 day trip with my Daughter & her friend but was taken ill so unable to travel . I emailed the hotel as soon as I found out 5 days before, asking for two rooms together. This was confirmed by them, as done . Upon checking in not only were they not next to each other, they were on different flloors !!! I asked to see a Manager as this was unacceptable. After an hour I finally got two rooms on the same floor. When checking my room was smaller than booked . I went down again to Duty Manager try to change, would or could not change !!! These two people were the worse FOH staff I have encounted on my 5 previous visits to NYC. This was brought to the attention of the General Manager a day later & since has offered something for my next visit, nice but would have better to have been dealt with on this stay .. Very clean hotel. all the other staff from Room to Security were great.. The TICK TOCK Diner attached is excellent for breakfast. Price is good , portions huge, staff smiling.The location is excellent , as we are great Macys fans. So not far to carry bags !!!!Near Penn Sation\r\nThe car service in the recption area NEW YORK RIDES are the best I have ever used in NYC . Our flight was 1 hour early , we thought we would have to hang around. No the driver was sent early as they checked arrivals.'
5,'Another great stay','This is my second stay & my husbands first . I chose to come back for location & the staff who did every thing to make this a great stay. Madeline- Guest Service for sorting out my resevation after problems with a stay in 2011. She was true to her word & kept an -upgrade that was 6 mths out of date. Ana on Front desk was so very good sorting out our room . Jim the Bellboy for alway greeting with a smile . We had a suite 3909. The views are so good . The Housekeeping Staff did such a good job, you could eat of the floor & I am fussy. The Hotel is Old . The rooms are smaller that the bigger , newer hotels . Having stayed in Hiltons & Millianuim Hotels which don\'t have the charm of the New Yorker you miss out. The whole of the staff from Security to Front door staff are always helpful & smiling. \r\nNew Yorker Rides ( Desk in Reception) are the best car service I have ever used -8 trips and second time of using them . We were 2.30hrs later that expected . The driver was still waiting in arrivals for us , no phone calls to make. £50.25 for a town car JFK to Hotel a great service. And a 4.30 am pick up to Newark was on timre & a smiling Driver. Tick Tock Diner is really good. Good food , hugh portions & fast service . We had B&B & the Contental Breakfast was really good , because we were there on a week-end breakfast was in Tick Tock. Coopers Taven - The food is good & fair price . Staff let it down as it did last time in 2011. Unfriendly & lack of service. Would I stay here again - of course. Location to Penn Station & of course Macys make it an ideal location'
4,'Good value for money','My daughter and I have just returned home after staying here for 11 nights. I am not sure what people are expecting of a huge, once regal hotel in NY that offers a reasonable rate and prime location but we chose to stay here again after a problem free stay same time last year. This year we had a lovely room with a view down 33rd st and it was spacious, clean and towels immaculate and changed every day. The signs of age are apparent but for the little time spent in a hotel room in NY, why are there so many people that knock this place? Several years ago we stayed in a more expensive hotel in NY and the room was so tiny we couldn\'t open our cases on the floor. This is a very good option for people who want an inexpensive, spacious, clean room in the best ever location in NY, but if you are going to be a whinger and pick at every little thing then go pay a lot more elsewhere.'
4,'Respect for an iconic Hotel','This is the fourth time we have stayed at this historic Hotel and have always found the facilities to be adequate. Sure the rooms are old but for the price and location you could not do better. The terrible reviews that many people give this Hotel are not warranted and would put off many wary people who would accept the condition of the old rooms under the circumstances. IT IS OLD, respect it for what it is and once was.\r\nTreat the staff with respect and they in turn respond. We have never had a problem because we have manners. The housekeeping staff work hard to maintain the rooms that some people leave like pigstyes - some people seem to think that is their right. Our rooms have always had clean bedding, change of towels everyday and clean bathroom. Being in New York we spend little time in our room and it serves our purpose well. Quite honestly I don\'t know what some people are expecting for the very fair cost of staying in the heart of NY opposite Penn Station. It appears to me that some people on this site try and out-do each other for the worst horror review. Just go stay somewhere else and make a bit more room for those of us who respect the age of this grand old Hotel.'
3,'Just a Room to sleep.','Since I wanted a hotel easily accessible by train and sightseeing tours, this was the nearest. You just come out of Penn Station and there it is, across the road. If you want just a room to sleep, then this is a convenient place, though not cheap.\r\nThe drawbacks:\r\nThe rooms need refurbishing very badly. The room I had looked dated.\r\nThe bathroom towels seemed from yesteryears. \r\nThe breakfast was just breads etc. and juice/tea/coffee kept in a small room.\r\nThere was no coffee/tea/drinking water in the rooms.\r\nThe ice machine was empty at 11.30pm.\r\nThe plus points.\r\nIt was easily accessible and close to Times Square (12-15 minutes walk from the hotel), where all the fun is at night. Lots of Theaters there and full of life. It feels as if the city does not sleep.\r\nIn case you want to see the shows, make sure you book tickets at least a day in advance. There is a counter in the hotel premises that helps in arranging tickets for the shows, apart from arranging other things eg. transport. (Maybe they charge a small commission but maybe its worth it as it saves you the bother of going out and buying it yourself). \r\nThe Grand Central Station is also a 10-12 minutes walk from the hotel in case you want to travel to other parts around New York and has excellent eateries too. \r\nThe Sight seeing operators (Hop on - Hop off bus) stand outside the hotel itself and sell the tickets then and there. It included the cruise around the Statue of Liberty. (timings of the cruise were 10am,11am,2pm and 4pm so you can plan) These are valid for 2 consecutive days. \r\nStep out of the Hotel and you are in Shopping Paradise. In case you go to Macy\'s, a block away, make sure you get your discount card from the visitor center of Macy\'s which was 10\% when I was there. This was over and above the discounts offered by the establishment.\r\nIf you are a foodie, step outside and all kinds of cuisines are available in walking distance.'
3,'Choose a Penn 5000 room','Stayed at the Hotel again (June 24th to 29th) after being disappointed on the first stay but chose a better room this time as it still was the most convenient place to stay.\r\nSpecially asked for a room facing the road so that I did not again get a wall in front.\r\nThe check in at 10.00pm took just 10mts considering a long line for check in. \r\nThe room was in the 10th floor and had the view of the Empire State Building from one window.\r\nThe high floor was a boon as there was very little noise from the roads, though the sound of sirens was still audible.\r\nI last reviewed this hotel exactly 1 year back.\r\nThe drawbacks that exist till now plus one more:\r\nThe breakfast was just breads etc. and juice/tea/coffee kept in a small room.\r\nThere was no coffee/tea/drinking water in the rooms.\r\n3. (added) No free wifi available anywhere in the premises considering the volume of people staying there. We took wifi for a day but the speed was too slow so had to go to places which had free and speedy wifi to log on. \r\nThe plus points are the same as last year but with the added removal of a few drawbacks:\r\n1.The room looked neater and cleaner, though the plug points were a bit shakey.\r\n2.The towels were a lot fresher, specially the bath towels.\r\nWe made a day trip to Boston and the bus stop was just a block away. \r\nIn case you want to see the shows, make sure you book tickets at least a few days in advance, (the counter in the hotel can help) as while we were deciding at the counter and within 5mts the tickets for the Lion King were sold out and we had to settle for Mary Poppins, which was, though our second choice, still excellent.\r\nThe transport bus to the Airport bus stand picks you up from outside the hotel (every 30mts) and takes you to the Grand Central station- (which is also a 10-12 minutes walk from the hotel) -so that you can catch the actual bus to the airport.\r\nShopping for branded stuff- In case you go to Macy\'s, a block away, make sure you get your discount card from the visitor center of Macy\'s which is till 10\% (as was last year).'
4,'Excelente ubicacion a bajo precio','Excelente ubicacion frente al Madison Square Garden, a 2 bloques de Macy´s. Conseguimos una promocion con desayuno incluido. El desayuno muy completo y servicio de cafeteria las 24 horas. Salvo la demora para el check in todo estuvo perfecto. Me alojaria en mi proximo viaje definitavemente.'
4,'Me sorprendio esta vez.','Me aloje desde el 19 hasta el 22 de agosto. He estado alojada en 2 ocasiones anteriormente en este hotel. Valoro su ubicacion que, para mi es excepcional. En esta oportunidad habia reservado una habitacion standard a traves de Despegar.com.ar sabiendo que es un hotel antiguo pero con buena relacion precio-calidad. Esta vez nos asignaron una habitacion totalmente remodelada, ubicada en el piso 10, la habitacion 1001A con 2 camas dobles.\r\nA diferencia de otras veces donde el check in era muy lento, esta vez fue rapido, habia poca gente. Contrate con desayuno, si bien era basico, no estaba mal. Un cafe, un jugo y un muffin muy bueno a retirar del barcito del lobby.\r\nVolveria otra vez.'
2,'Brutal for the price, run down property','Great location, friendly staff, but awful rooms. Bed was awful, plaster falling off walls, dreary rooms, smelt awful. One gets what they pay for. Over priced for quality of room. Only decent thing is the great location. TV was awful, dull hallways, bad experience. Will never stay again.'
1,'Hotel Penn','This is by far the worst hotel I have stayed in. yes the location is great but other than that I can not find one thing positive about it. It ruined my last day in NYC as I needed a place to stay on the final night due to my hotel I had first two nights was full. This place should be condemmed.'
3,'posizione top','L\'hotel di per se è accettabile se lo consideri solo come base per la notte.\r\nLa pulizia era nella norma. Ma quello che gli fa guadagnare dei punti è la sua posizione strategica.\r\nPer noi è stata una buona scelta visto che cercavamo un hotel in centro a prezzi ragionevoli.; ideale per chi si sa adattare.'
2,Pessimo,'Stata a new York in aprile 2009 e soggiornato al Pennsylvania ... La posizione e\' ottima, proprio di fronte al madison square garden e vicino a tante attrazioni turistiche. La pecca e\' la pulizia che lascia molto a desiderare e le stanze che sono piccole e buie. Avevamo svelto questo hotel perché era economico ma sicuramente e\' meglio spendere qualcosa un più per avere qualcosa di meglio. Comunque e\' stato il mio viaggio più bello ... I love nyc !'
3,'Our Trip to NYC','Io e mio marito abbiamo soggiornato per due anni di seguito all\'Hotel Pennsylvania (la prima volta in viaggio di nozze).\r\nSicuramente la struttura ha bisogno di lavori di ristrutturazione perchè abbastanza datata ma la posizione è impagabile. A due passi dai punti nevralgici di New York, l\'Hotel Pennsylvania vi consentirà di raggiungere a piedi molte attrazioni della città e, perchè no, magari anche una passeggiata a Times Square dopo una giornata stancante in giro per la città.\r\nIl personale è disponibile, la pulizia accettabile. Abbiamo alloggiato sia nella camera standard che in quella superior e devo dire che lo spazio non è angusto, anzi..\r\nI letti sono comodi.Il primo anno avevamo addirittura la camera con vista sull\'empire state building.\r\nUnica nota dolente sono i bagni che sono davvero vecchiotti.\r\nMa vedetela così: quanto tempo trascorrete in camera durante un sggiorno nella città che non dorme mai?!?!?!?! Noi davvero poco...E torneremo ancora in questo hotel.'
4,'Altro giro, altra corsa','Ed eccomi qui, di ritorno dal 3° viaggio a New York e per la terza volta abbiam soggiornato al Pennsylvania, sempre in virtù della posizione davvero ottima e anche un pò per aver approfittato di un\'offerta che ci ha fatto risparmiare 150€ rispetto allo scorso anno...\r\nLa struttura necessita davvero di migliorie ma per il tempo che abbiam trascorso in camera l\'importante per noi era aver la stanza e la biancheria pulita (cosa che han sempre fatto). Quest\'anno, tra l\'altro, abbiam speso meno e ci hanno dato anche una camera più grande...\r\nAl prossimo viaggio a New York ;)'
4,'Not too bad really considering reviews!!','I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of March with my mother. Check in was about 25 mins. I was dreading going to our room from all the reviews. The room was grand - nothing fancy but I wasn\'t expecting fancy from the reviews. It had a clean bed and clean bathroom - the room was darkish though and dated or old-fashioned (whatever way you want to put it). What more do you want in New York as we literally used the room to sleep in and that was it. There was no noise in the corridor and all we heard outside was the drum of the cars below and the sirens now and again. i think we were so tired that we slept. \r\nIt is a fantastic base as you are literally 7 mins walk to Times Square, across the road from Penn Station (we got the air train in from JFK and ended up coming up from the metro right beside the hotel!!), Macys is 3 mins walk. Brilliant location. I will definitely stay here again. We previously stayed at the Affinia Manhattan and while a fab hotel and really spacious bright room, it was very expensive so the Pennsylvania is a great budget hotel. Well worth staying here so that you have all the extra money to spend on shopping.\r\nIf it is you first time going to New York, stay at a different hotel if you are not prepared for a basic style hotel. Otherwise cannot complain!!'
2,'It got worse (4th time here)','We\'ve been here for 4 times. The first two stays were perfect: large, newly renovated rooms. The last time we were here (februari \'07) the room was extremely small and not as clean (seemed like the renovation had worn off). \r\nThis time I asked for a big room upon checkin, which the clerk said we would get. Well, we didn\'t: same small room, same worn bathroom. Since checkin already took about 1 hour (you have to stand in line for that long!) I didn\'t bother to ask for another room.\r\nService seems to have degraded over time: no more free morning newspapers, and when the TV remote didn\'t seem to work, a guy came to change the batteries, which didn\'t help, since it was broke. He just shrugged and said: well, OK, and walked off...\r\nWe asked for an extra pillow, which the maid supervisor said we would get, but we didn\'t get one and had to ask again around 22:00...\r\nIn-room internet didn\'t work: the cable was there, the TV had a screen saying: press menu to access internet. So, back to the concierge, wait another 1 hour in line, just to be told: If it doesn\'t work, it doesn\'t work.\r\nIt looks like the rumours of a future demolition of the hotel are causing the staff to care less and less for their guests. \r\nIf you go here, just don\'t expect anything, except for a stay in The Greatest City in the World, then you\'ll be fine.\r\nWe\'ll probably give Ramada New Yorker another try though, as it\'s almost in the same location.'
1,'Worse and worse','We stayed here for the 7th time in about as many years and this hotel keeps getting worse. The rooms seem to get dirtier each time we visit. There\'s a Penn 5000 check in counter that\'s just never open, so you have to stand in line for an hour, just to check in.\r\nFront desk was rude, claimed I didn\'t have a Penn 5000 room when it clearly stated it on my Expedia reservation, so I guess they don\'t want you to reserve through another site.\r\nThe bathroom in the room was disgusting; stain everywhere, so bad my wife cleaned it herself right after check in.\r\nI can honestly say: enough is enough, this was the last time we stayed at hotel Pennsylvania.'
1,'The most disgusting hotel ever','Where to start! Blood stained carpet, plug sockets hanging out of the wall, bathroom taps hanging out the wall, brown stains in bath, vomit stains in the hall way ( every where) generally filthy, mold and mildew growing in air con which leaked on to the already filthy carpet. Walls flaking and filthy. Staff unhelpful and not bothered.'
1,'The worst hotel I have ever stayed in, huge dissapiontment.','I\'m not even sure where to start, maybe on arriving in our hotel room all excited about being in New York, we opened the door to a filthy blood stained carpet. Bath room taps hanging out the wall, brown stains in the tub, all plug sockets broken and hanging out of the wall, air con moldy and leaking on to the carpet, filthy walks, flaking moldy skirting boards and just to top it all off the hall way to our room was covered in vomit stains and more blood stains. Reception staff unhelpful. I can say the bar staff were friendly and helpful.'
4,CENTRALISSIMO!!!!,'L\'hotel è posizionato in posizione veramente strategica: vicinissimo a Time Square e al Medison Square Garden ed è sopra la Penn Station: dalla quale di possono prendere molte linee di Metro e i treni per raggiungere il JFK.EWR e il N.J. Uno spettacolo!!\r\nNoi abbiamo scelto una camera PENN 5000 che con un leggero sovrapprezzo aveva diversi vantaggi: check-in dedicato, colazione compresa, accesso alla palestra e ad una sala dotata di 2 pc con connessione internet e la possibilità di stampare, e fare telefonate/fax nazionali gratuitamente!\r\nLe camere non sono sicuramente nuove, e nemmeno troppo pulite: la moquette non è delle + candide e il copriletto avrebbe bisogno di una sciaquata. Ma nel complesso è accetabile. Poi dalla camera avevamo una speldida vista sull\'Empire!!\r\nConsigliato per la posizione unica e per il prezzo competitivo!!!!'
3,'POSIZIONE OTTIMA','Dicembre a NY con un gruppo di tre amici, abbiamo soggiornata all\'Hotel Pennsylvania (dove avevo già alloggiato) ci è stata data una camera grandissima con ingresso in salottino, bagno e ripostiglio separati e ampissima camera matrimoniale con 2 letti queen size. \r\nLa camera era lato 7th ave. quindi un po\' rumorosa fin dalle prime ore del mattino causa traffico, nonostanti fossimo ad un piano ababstanza alto. \r\nLa struttura non è nuovissima e l\'arredamento un po\' fatiscente, la pulizia della camera accettabile. Ma nonostante ciò il rapporto qualità prezzo a mio avviso è ottimo. \r\nLa posizine è eccezzionale a pochi metri dalla Penn Station dove transitano le principali linee della metro e i treni della LIRR (utili per raggiungere il JFK) e del NJ transit (per raggiungere il New Jersey e Newark); a un paio di isolati dall\'Empire e dalla 34th street: the fashion ave.'

1,'Room was horrible','Oriental girls who checked us in was full of attitude,when I asked her for non-smoking she replied you should have asked for that when you made reservation she pounded her keyboard so hard,I thought she was going to break it.Room was awful, dirty carpets,bathroom,wallpaper falling off walls,looked like it hadnt been renovated in years.\r\nFront desk staff blew us off,made no attempt to change room for us.They did send maintencance man named Alejandro to check heater which wasnt working.Even he was appalled by our room.By the grace of God he got us moved to a much nicer rooma t no charge.He was our angel in all of this.Would never stay there again though.Good location in midtown ,ext to penn station,thats the only good thing I could say about it.'
1,'1 Star is a generous rating','Everything you\'ve heard about this place is true and then some.Rude staff,deplorable condition of rooms,looks like it hasnt been renovated since the Hoover administration was in office.Good location is the only good thing to be said about it.'
3,'Comodità a buon prezzo','Sono stato a new york 4 volte, e per 2 volte mi sono fermato al pennsylvania. La comodità di avere un albergo nel centro ad un prezzo onesto è fantastica, e credo che chi lo critica x la pulizia sbagli.. Io lo trovo discreto e pulito, d\'altronde se vuoi vivere lavita di new york in stanza vai solo a dormire( poco) e a lavarti... Datemi retta,albergo perfetto e godetevi la grande mela!!'
3,'Non capite...','Credo che chi critica questo albergo sia qualcuno che non è mai stato a new york,io ci sono stato molte volte e preferisco dormire qui piuttosto che pagare il triplo una hall e una facciata meravigliosa poi.... Le camere sono le stesse( vedi sheraton....)il penn ha le camere decorose ed è così in centro che più in centro non si puó... Se volete dell\'altro andate al plaza o al waldorf astoria!!!'
3,'Bon rapport qualité prix!','Hotel tres bien sité, Chambre en rapport avec le prix,menage fait tous les jours ,serviettes changées ,ne pas oublier le Tip tous les jours pour le personnel de menage,c est leur salaire.Ceux qui se plaignent de l entretien ont sans doute oubliez de le laisser.Il ne reste plus qu a tomber sur la bonne chambre.'
4,'Qualite prix exellent','Je suis de nouveau parti a New York cette annee au mois de Mai avec des amis, et nous sommes redescendu a cet hotel,que j avais bien aimé, qui est admirablement placé.La chambre etait toujours ordinaire,mais toujours propre.Le linge est changé tous les jours. A quelques pas de Time Square.Pour le prix payé pour un hotel avec un tel emplacement c est une affaire!! .Je le repete pour ceux qui trouve que le menage est mal fait,laisser tous les matins sur la table de nuit 1 ou 2 dollars de Tip,les femmes de menage font leur salaire avec.'
5,'Extremely Honest Review....Really Liked the Hotel','This is a really honest review on this hotel. I booked this hotel for me and my boyfriend about 6 months ago. Since then I have been reading the reviews on the hotel and was so shocked at what I read. I contemplated booking other accommodation however this was a more expensive option. I was only staying for 1 week and just wanted a nice clean room to sleep in. When we got there on first impressions I was very impressed with the Lobby. We were 2.5 hrs early for check-in, however the staff were extremely friendly and polite and told us come back in half an hour. When we got checked in we went up to the rooms and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw our room. We were on the 6th floor. Our room was immaculate, you could not find fault with it. New furniture, bathroom spotless and it was very nice. The view was just of a building across the way which didnt bother me in the slightest. There was a huge tv. Our room was a superior king room and it honestly was just lovely. The cleaning staff were so polite and friendly always saying hello in the morning. Everyday the room was cleaned and fresh towels were put in the bathroom. The location of this hotel is unreal. You are smack bang in the centre of everything. \r\nI would definitely stay here again and I would reccommend it to anyone. If you want a really luxurious room this may not be the hotel for you but when your in NY your not there to sit in the room for the day. You ust want some where clean and safe to sleep. \r\nPlease take this review into account as I was dreading going here having read the reviews for 6 months before hand....I was so surprised with what I saw, its a great hotel.'
5,'Have stayed here twice - an honest and fair review!','Not a luxury hotel but the location is fantastic! Have stayed here twice once in summer and once in winter. In winter the rooms were really warm and comfortable. Rooms are basic and bathroom a bit dated but everything worked fine and the rooms were clean most importantly! I had read all the negative reviews before staying in this hotel but was willing to take the chance and I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely stay here again!'
2,'Try to find something else','My daughter and I stayed here because it was the only thing we could find at the last minute for an event nearby. The room was worse than anything I\'ve seen in Eastern Europe- but after an exchange of blankets (since the originial was a torn mess / and some new pillows- we were able to sleep here. The location is great- but I would try hard not to stay here again- way too much money for the moldy bathroom and uncomfortable- and old- bedding.'
1,'5 rooms later and they were all filthy','After waiting an hour to check in, we were given our room keys. We arrived on the 14th floor, the lift door opened and the smell of damp hit you. On opening the bedroom door, we noticed the plaster was coming off the walls, the bath had been painted and was still dirty, the bathroom actually looked like workmen had been in and hadn\'t cleaned up after themselves. We checked other rooms, some of the corridors had steel doors which gave the feel we were in a prison. No hot or cold on the taps - which isn\'t very good. Our room was the size of a postage stamp and we were told it would be cleaned when we went out, but when we came back at 10pm it still hadn\'t been cleaned.\r\n The asked the head receptionist if we could upgrade, his reply was why would you want to do that, the rooms are the same, he also said if we didn\'t like it we could check out? After looking at 5 rooms, we went back to reception and the head receptionist refused to speak to us. Even the bellboy said the hotel is a 2 star going down to 1 and the hotel should be knocked down and rebuilt. \r\nThe bed and towels were spotless and the location was great - the only positive things we could say about our visit. New York is getting so expensive these days.. This hotel may suit young people who are only looking for a cheap place to sleep!'
2,'not worth the location','On arrival at the hotel, there was no queue and we were quickly checked in. However, we were not even pointed in the direction of the lifts to get to our hotel rooms, so we had to find our own way. We are non-smokers but were placed in a smoking room which smelled vile, and the bathroom was unclean - there was makeup smeared on the shower curtain and black grime at the bottom of the bath. We didn\'t ask to change because we were on the same floor as the rest of our group and had a twin room- both things they seemed to have a challenge finding at check in. We cleaned the bathroom ourselves and sprayed some airfreshener which helped. The bed linen seemed clean and the room was spacious enough. On exploring the area, we found that the location of the hotel is excellent.\r\nOn the second day while we were out, somebody came to clean our room. When we got back to the room, this person had spilled an unknown substance all over our dressing room table. This had leaked into the drawers below where we were storing our clothes. It had also made some marks in the varnish and our tv remote control was damp. They had removed the clothes from the drawer, put them on a chair and put a towel in the drawer (leaving us one towel short). The tv remote did not work after that and was the only way to use the tv. After this incident, we hung our \'do not disturb\' sign up and left it there for the remainder of our trip.'
4,'Comfy, Handy, what you pay for','Just spent a week at Hotel Pennsylvania and was terrified what to expect after reading reviews on here prior to going. Not sure if people expect a whole lot for little money or just like to complain. I found the hotel, clean tidy and really handy to everywhere. Sure it\'s an old building so it has a few cracks and bruises around the edges, but the rooms were clean when we arrived and cleaned everyday with fresh towels each day. The staff who cleaned the room were helpful and extremely friendly, a real happy bunch, who made you smile each morning. Reception could be busy but this is due to the huge demand of customers checking in/checking out etc. A little bit of patience and it\'s all straight forward. Hotel Staff in general were really helpful and went out of their way to accommodate any request. All in all if your looking for somewhere to put your head down that\'s clean, cheerful and handy to everywhere then this hotel is spot on. If your looking for an amazing high class, high quality hotel then pay the money and stay in one.'
3,'buona posizione ma....','Questo hotel si trova sulla 7th av. proprio di fronte alla Penn Station: quindi buona posizione e facilmente raggiungibile dall\'aeroporto sia in treno che in metropolitana;\r\nè un hotel molto grande costruito nei primi decenni del novecento; arrivando abbiamo trovato coda al check in, paragonabile alle code in aeroporto;\r\nle camere sono spaziose, la biancheria pulita ed il servizio di pulizia buono; tuttavia il tutto ha un aria trasandata dovuta, suppongo, all\'età dell\'edificio che non è stato più di tanto mantenuto e ripulito nel corso degli anni.\r\nLa zona è tuttavia ben servita, ci sono innumerevoli possibilità per mangiare, di vario tipo e, a piedi si possono raggiungere un buon numero di attrazioni.\r\nLo consiglio a chi non bada troppo all\'aspetto esteriore, ma cerca un posto per dormire in buona posizione.'
3,'ottima posizione - accettabile','Sono ritornata in questo hotel dopo esserci già stata a marzo; questa volta con la formula colazione compresa; premesso che la posizione dell\'hotel è ottima, ho avuto un\'impressione decisamente migliore questa volta rispetto a qualche nese prima: la stanza era all\'undicesimo piano, mentre la volta precedente al terzo piano; ho trovato la camera nella norma, i mobili soddisfacenti e la pulizia senz\'altro curata; la colazione accettabile, però il locale in cui era servita ( a buffet) era dotato di pochi tavoli per cui si riempiva subito; ho dedotto comparando le due permanenze che essendo l\'hotel molto grande molto dipende dalla localizzazione della camera; lo ritengo una soluzione soddisfacente anche se non entusiasmante.'
5,'Super Hotel, freundliches Personal, Lage unschlagbar!','Ich bin von diesem Hotel schlichtweg begeistert! Die zentrale Lage ist und bleibt unschlagbar. Man hat die Penn Station direkt vor der Tür. Der Madison Square Garden ist direkt gegenüber. Diverse Bars & Restaurants um die Ecke genauso wie das Empire State B., Macy\'s und weitere Geschäfte. \r\nDas Hotel ist ein riesiger Kasten( ich meine 1700 Zimmer gelesen zu haben) mit einem schönen Eingang und einer tollen Empfangshalle. Es gibt einen Schalter wo man sich Broadway-Tickets oder Sightseeing Tours buchen kann. Ein kleines Restaurant und ein Shop mit Gebäck, Getränken u.s.w.\r\nDer Check In ist auch schnell erledigt und das Personal ist sehr, sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Man bekommt einen Stadtplan und ein paar City Zeitschriften. Es gibt acht Fahrstühle und die langen Flure sind mit Schildern der jeweiligen Zimmernummern ausgestattet. \r\nNatürlich sind die Etagen nicht mehr ganz so modern wie der Empfangsbereich im Hotel! Aber trotzdem gut. Mein Zimmer war sehr groß, sauber und einfach eingerichtet. Bett, Schreibtisch, Stuhl, Fernseher und was für die Frauenwelt wichtig ist...mehrere große Spiegel;)! Das Badezimmer war auch groß,hell und sauber.\r\nAn dieser Stelle möchte ich loswerden das natürlich hier und da die Wandfarbe etwas abgeblättert war, das Waschbecken ein sprung hatte und der Teppich einen Fleck. Aber man befindet sich in einem 2 Sterne Hotel und nicht in einem 5 Sterne Deluxe Hotel. Ich hab erst die Bewertungen gelesen, nachdem ich schon gebucht hatte. Und ich hab dort Sachen gelesen...ich war aufs allerschlimmste vorbereitet! Und wurde mehr als positiv überrascht! Keine Krabbeltiere oder sonstiges. Ich habe mich in dem Hotel sehr sicher gefühlt, mein zimmer lag im achten Stock und außer die Sirenen der Polizei( leise) hab ich nichts gehört. Mein Zimmer lag zur Hofseite und ich konnte also nichts sehen außer andere Hotelzimmer. Aber auch das ist egal, da man in einer wunderschönen Stadt ist und sein Zimmer eh nur zum schlafen braucht;) Ich kann dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen und ich komme auch wieder 2011.'
4,'Hervorragendes Hotel, immer wieder gerne!','Eine Reise in meine Lieblingsmetropole war längst wieder überfällig! Am 17.Mai 2012 war es dann endlich wieder soweit. Da ich alleine reise und mein Budget im Auge behalten muss, musste ein relativ günstiges Hotel her. So verschlug es mich wieder ins Hotel Pennsylvania in New York.\r\nEs ist 1 1/2 Jahre her als ich das erste Mal dort war und die meist schlechteren Bewertungen hatten mich sehr verunsichert! Aber ich wurde eines besseren belehrt und positiv überrascht!\r\nMal sehen ob ich einfach nur Glück hatte?;-)\r\nTja, die Lage ist...wie sollte es auch anders sein...PERFEKT!\r\nDie Pennstation ist direkt vor der Tür. Also bin ich vom JFK mit dem Airtrain bis zur Jamaika Station gedüst und von dort in die Linie 1(rot) gestiegen und tata....Ziel erreicht.\r\nKurze Anmerkung: Man braucht vorher kein Ticket für den Airtrain zu kaufen!!!! Beim verlassen des Zuges wird man abkassiert. Kostet 5 Dollar und das praktische ist das man bei den Herrschaften gleich eine Wochenkarte kaufen kann. Sehr empfehlenswert!\r\nIm Hotel angekommen, ging es an der Rezeption ziemlich flott vorran. Der junge Mann war sehr freundlich und versuchte alles meinem Wunsch nach einem Zimmer mit schöner Aussicht nachzukommen! Meine Zimmernr. war die 523A! Die Spannung stieg...allerdings musste ich erstmal etwas suchen weil mich das A verwirrte. Im Zimmer angekommen, wurde ich mal wieder positiv überrascht! Vor allem war es offensichtlich renoviert. Keine abgeplatzte Farbe oder ähnliches. Es war wirklich in einem super Zustand! Das Bad hatte sogar eine neue Mischbatterie. Naja der Ausblick war nun nicht der beste, aber der freundliche Mann an der Rezeption hatte mich schon vorgewarnt das sie ziemlich ausgebucht sind und er nicht viel Möglichkeiten hat. Aber er hatte mir angeboten wenn es mir nicht gefallen sollte, soll ich wieder kommen und wir suchen was neues.\r\nAber alles schnick schnack, ich war mehr als zufrieden! 7 Tage war ich dort und mein Zimmer wurde jeden Tag gereinigt und mit Handtüchern wurde auch nicht gegeizt. \r\nOh Gott, ich sehe gerade an der Seite andere Bewertungen...die sind aber schlecht!!!!\r\nAlso ich verstehe das nicht! New York ist eine Weltmetropole, somit sind die Hotels auch super teuer! Das müsste jeder wissen! Wer billig übernachten möchte sollte dann vielleicht ein Hostel buchen! Natürlich ist das Pennsylvania teuer! Aber eben noch eins von den günstigsten. Und für alle die es noch nicht begriffen haben...es liegt direkt und super zentral in Manhattan! Deshalb auch die Preise! Wenn es in Queens, Jersey oder am Flughafen liegen würde, wäre es wohl auch billiger! Und es hat auch keine 5 Sterne!!!! Ich stelle mir langsam die Frage was die Leute eigentlich erwarten???? Es ist ein Riesen-Betten-Bunker und ich will gar nicht wissen wie viele Leute da in einem Jahr ein- und ausgehen. Natürlich ist der Eingangsbereich riesig und ständig voll mit ankommenden und abreisenden Menschen. Hallo? Wir befinden uns in NYC;-) \r\nDie Leute wollen Luxus, goldene Türklinken, ein Zimmer in dem am besten vorher noch nie jemand übernachtet hat und das alles möglichst umsonst. \r\nBeschweren sich die Leute auch weil der Times Square zu voll ist? Und die Subway zu laut und alt???? \r\nAlso ganz objektiv aus meiner Erfahrung bewertet: \r\n-sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal (Rezeption, Zimmermädchen, Gepäckaufbewahrung).\r\n-Empfangshalle sehr groß, viele Gäste, mal laut, mal leiser, sieht neuwertig aus\r\n-mehrere funktionstüchtige Fahrstühle vorhanden\r\n-ich kann nur von der 5 & 8 Etage sprechen...altmodisch,lange Flure(weil großes Hotel), Auslegeware ist alt sieht aber gesaugt aus, die Zimmertüren sind so halbrund irgendwie, typisch altes amerikanisches Flair halt! Bitte kein Marmorfußboden oder goldene Türklinken erwarten!\r\n-damaliges Zimmer (8Etage) etwas abgewohnt, hier und da löste sich die Farbe von den Wänden, keine neue aber gesaugte Auslegeware, großes Zimmer, funktionstüchtiges Bad, erster Eindruck....sauber und ordentlich (ich habe keine Schränke verrückt und nicht unters Bett geguckt, der Teppich wurde auch nicht mit einer Lupe kontrolliert), alte aber funktionstüchtige Klimaanlage\r\n-5 Etage, neuer Farbanstrich, alte Auslegeware, neue Mischbatterie im Bad, Fenster von außen dreckig, alte aber funktionierende Klimaanlage, sauber & ordentlich\r\n- ich wurde nachts nicht von Bettwanzen angeknabbert und Fußpilz habe ich mir auch nicht eingefangen;-) ich lebe noch;-)\r\nFazit: Kein Luxus aber wer zentral und günstig Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten sucht, ist im Hotel Pennsylvania goldrichtig;-)\r\nIch werde wiederkommen;-)\r\nKleiner Tip: Wer verreist sollte sich den Gegebenheiten in dem Land etwas anpassen. In den USA ist es üblich Tip zu geben, ich finde es einfach traurig wenn man bei der Gepäckaufbewahrung nicht mal 1$ Tip für die Leute dort über hat! Natürlich zahlt man vorab dafür ( ich glaube 4$) aber wer so eine Reise bucht und shoppen kann ohne Ende, der stirbt von 1$ nicht.\r\nSo das war\'s!'
2,'Interesting, to say the least','Some friends and I booked this hotel through an online Travel agent. We had recently stayed a block away at the Affinia Manhattan, and every time we walked by the Hotel Pennsylvania we commented on how nice it looked.\r\nWe knew from our previous stay how convenient the location was - right across the street from Madison Square Gardens, and steps away from the 1,2, and 3 line. The location itself is the best part of the hotel.\r\nThe lobby was extremely nice, although we almost experienced issues at check-in. We arrived at the hotel at 11am, and check-in wasn\'t until 3ish. Initially, we were going to have to pay $4 a bag to store them until check-in. Luckily, the front desk sensed our frustration and found a room that was available.\r\nAfter seeing the lobby, we expected the rest of the hotel to be top-notch - but it didn\'t come close. The hallways were dimly lit, and the layout of the floors were a little confusing. Luckily, one of the housekeepers was on our floor and able to point us in the right direction to our room.\r\nThe doors looked like entrances to a space capsule. They looked like they were metal, were painted green, and popped out away from the door.\r\nThe room was actually quite large, which we all appreciated. However, it was obvious that it was a very old room. The bathroom was quite small and probably the worst hotel bathroom I\'ve ever been in. The shower curtain was ratty and very old, and the shower had to run at least five minutes in order to get hot water.\r\nOne bonus was that the room had an empty walk-in closet area, which I used to store all my luggage and change clothes in.'
3,'A mixed bag!','Booked this through Priceline at not a great price. Outside of hotel is covered in scaffolding so a bit difficult to recognise. You enter the hotel and take an escalator up to the large lobby area. Ellie was very helpful and friendly at checkin and we were happy to be able to checkin before 3pm! Lobby was a little on the dark side as were the corridors, not sure why. We opened the door to our room and although I had read reviews I have to say I was shocked at how small the room was!!! The bed dominated the space and there were a couple of small bedside tables and a small desk with only one chair. There was a tiny closet by the desk with a couple of shelfs, drawer and safe. The short corridor into the room had a small hanging closet with iron and board. The bathroom was pretty cramped too with a glass wall to the bedroom. The bed was comfortable but the first night the sheets were too small for the bed so moved around a lot. We left our towels hanging up and didn\'t request a linen change so were surprised to see new towels and bed linen, what\'s up with that??? Contintal buffet breakfast was $28 and it cost me $4.66 for a small decaff. Restaurant was quirky too with long medieval tables with bench seats and \'thrones\' at each end. Definitely not a bad hotel but not my favorite. May be more for the twenty somethings!'
4,'Very hip and fun','We had a great stay at The Hudson. The room is small but adequate. The bathroom is fine. the room was clean. And the location was great for access to Lincoln Center where we had a concert and the Time/Warner building for shopping and dining.\r\nIt is more about the buzz of the place than anything else. The lobby is like a canopy in a rain forest. The public spaces off the lobby are fun. The library room is a great place to hang out. It has a pool table and wonderful sitting groups.'
5,'Hudson Hotel continues to provide the best accomodations in New York','Spent three nights in the Hudson last weekend and once again the hotel did not disappoint. The Hudson is the only hotel that I will stay in for my travel to New York with its awesome location, beautiful Phillipe Starck design, and excellent staff you can never go wrong. The rooms are small but they made good use of the space when they designed the hotel. The energy and excitement that emanates from the moment you walk in provides for an incredible experience. There are several areas to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of New York including the private garden, the sky terrace and library bar. The rooms are also a great place for two people to unwind and rest. There is no other hotel for me when I stay in New York. The Hudson Hotel is the absolute best!'
5,'Another amazing weekend in New York and at the Hudson','I just got back from another trip to New York where I had another amazing stay at the Hudson - my favorite hotel in New York. I got in early Friday and although no promises were made they accommodated me with a check-in at 2pm. Found the room to be in perfect order when I arrived and enjoyed a nice afternoon nap on the comfortable bed. The energy of the hotel can not be beat where you always feel like you are staying at the most exciting place in New York. Within easy walking distance of Columbus Circle it was very easy for me to get on the Subway and head down to Chelsea for dinner with friends. The location can not be beat and after some long days of activity it was great to come back and enjoy a nice relaxing night in my room. I will continue to stay at the Hudson as my first choice for accommodations when traveling to New York.'
5,'great design small rooms','liked this property i am a fan of schrager-design-boutique concept so my review must be readed in this context\r\nloved very much the restaurant bar and lobby area one of my favorite places in new york\r\nlike friendly and trendy staff must clarify that we are not service intensive\r\ni think that everyone visiting must stay or at least have dinner in this property you can have a great experience for average budget\r\nonly complain is room size but must visit at least once so you can complain as everyone does'
1,'The worst hotel in NYC! by far!Waste of euros.','I stayed at Hudson as it was recommended to me from my friends at Societe Generale. I will never stay again or recommend. Walls are as thin as paper, music sound goes up after 7pm - I felt I was in the bar, in my room. Bathroom was so small, I could barely turn around. Old towels with bad smell. Bed, well a camping bed is more comfortable. No room service and no restaurant for lunch.\r\nUnless you are looking to drink your meals, stay elsewhere. And for the price, there are plenty of other options in NYC.\r\nThe staff - could not care less about anyone but themselves. Have no idea what they are doing and not attractive - sloppy and don\'t look clean.\r\nAnd....roaches in the room - that was my welcome gift.'
1,'Should be closed!','I returned- against my will - to this rate box. Thought things could have turned around but it was simply atrocious! The new walls and paint can\'t cover the mold and mildew. Room service...oh yes, there is none!\r\nI called the Catering Dept. to see if I could host a small cocktail somewhere in the hotel. I got transferred to someone in sales, who clearly had no clue. Got transferred to someone with a foreign accent, maybe Canadian? who was abrupt and had no time for me.\r\nEnough! Never again!!!'
3,'Nice cool hotel in my fav NYC spot, but with a few issues...','Booking 9 days at The Hudson for a nice price was very exciting for me and I coudn\'t wait for one more NYC trip, the best city in the world, after Rio, naturally.... \r\nThe spot is perfect and I think Columbus Circle is a great strategic point in the island. Here we have acess to many subway lines, buses, taxis, easy nice healthy meals and groceries at the Warner Center Wholefoods Market. You can also walk, what I love to do in NYC, to Central Park, Lincoln Center, Times Square theatres and even to the 5th ave and the East side.\r\nAbout The Hudson, I think the boutique setting is very attractive and cool, including the room decor, but the size of the standard oom is very, very, veryyyyy tiny(I knew it was small, but if you think small is average small, think again!)!!! Uncomfortable for two, but a single non-shopping person would be fine there, I guess(but does anyone who likes trendy hotels is a non-shooping person?) It is clean and the room service is ok, but absolutely everything is surcharge. The front desk staff and concierges, however, are helpless.\r\nAt the end, I kept thinking it was a nice experience and that I would come back for the location, but that I would rather have, if close to Columbus Circle, an old hotel big poorly decorated room to spread our lovely selves and our also lovely shopping bags!!'
1,'Down the drain...','This is my third stay at the Hudson after Priceline biddings. Although it has a wonderful location, the hotel quality is going down the drain!  So:\r\nIf you want to have your check in at 8 p.m., because the room is supposedly not yet clean, go to Hudson hotel.\r\nIf you want to have problems almost every day with your room card key, go to Hudson hotel.\r\nIf you don’t need your room telephone to work, go to Hudson hotel.\r\nIf you want to get a rude, unpolite treatment at the hotel reception desk, after complaining about all those absurd situations, go to Hudson hotel.\r\nIf you expect the courtesy every hotel guest deserves, DO NOT go to Hudson Hotel.'
2,'A little improvement, but many of the same problems','This was our fourth stay at The Hudson, due to their competitive constant availability in the discount sites and the great hotel location, in upper midtown west, close to Central Park, Bdway, etc. We had major problems with our last stay, like not being able to check in before 8 pm(!), what didnt happen this time(maybe because is was Monday and the hotel seemed quieter). But as it is usual at the Hudson, the first room they give you is always a wreck: this time it was a room with no locks(!!), what first did not let us lock the room, and thant has locked us out with all our stuff inside the room, what made us go back down and ask for another room. The next room was ok, small as we know all rooms are at this property, and we managed to survive with the lack of space for a long ten days stay. Another special remark is that The Hudson Hotel managers and even the Morgans Group personnel doesn\'t even bother to answer emails anymore, what makes me really perplex with the total lack of respect towards customers. The managers posts answers in the TA after they receive a bad review and than they couldn\'t care less if you are going back there expecting to have a better experience. Shame on this kind of business!'
3,'Headed Downhill','I\'ve been staying at the Hudson for about a decade, 3-4 times a year. Each time I check in its like my first stay, no recognition, nothing. You think they could store my basic information after a few visits (address, e-mail). The rooms are tiny, but serviceable for one person for a night or two. They are getting worn (missing desk lamp with a hole in the desk, chipped walls, broken door lock, etc), especially the hallways. Service is of the could care less type. Doormen more interested in talk among themselves, one check in clerk that could not even acknowledge your existence. I don\'t expect much from a hotel in NYC in the $200 range, but a little goes a long way and the Hudson really went downhill on my last visit.'
3,'I really just tired of this hotel....','I\'ve been staying at hudson for 10 years, its our corporate hotel. The service was good and friendly but beware of staying here is you are not some club kid:\r\nChecked in a 1AM after a long flight from the west coast and room was not ready, no big deal but how many stays do I have to have in my history to assure a room hours and hours after the check in time?\r\nNever accept a room facing the inner courtyard on the lower floors. The music from the lobby and bar come right through the wall. On my last night I was able to get about an hour of sleep before my 5AM wake up call (the Bar closes around 3:30 AM)\r\nNothing really worked in the room: TV remote dead, AC/Heat did not work and when it did had a lound knocking noise. Also the window was sealed shut (I could not even open it for the approved inch or two of fresh air)\r\nIf you are on a good rate and have a quiet room its OK, if you are staying on business and need to make morning meetings stay at another property.'
5,'Great Location but get a room above 16th Floor!','This is the second time I have stayed at the Hudson and i must admit their Customer Service has improved hugely from my last stay, all the staff were helpful and very friendly, the door staff are an asset to the Hotel, they manage to conjure up cabs even in the middle of thunder storm!\r\nBedrooms are small but this is New York but ensure you get a room above the 16th Floor unless you intend to party all night and want the sound of the bar & music in your room!\r\nThe roof garden on the 15th floor is a beautiful space to go and chill with your ipad or a book\r\nI loved the location as it\'s not in the thick of things but is easy to get to all the attractions, I like the fact it\'s round the corner form Hells Kitchen and a stroll to Central Park.\r\nGreat diner over the road called Flame for that important pancakes or french toast breakfast!'
3,'Excellent location but....','The rooms are tiny I had booked an upgrade hate to think what the standard room was like, they have apparently refurbished????? the corridors look like so thing out of a hostel, I love the location of this hotel for Hells kitchen and Central park along with the shopping but the bathroom is microscopic! Will really re consider where I stay in New York as this was my third time here and I am still amazed at how they get away with selling such small rooms! Hotel concierge are great and the door guys and incredible, always happy even when it\'s raining and they can\'t get you a cab!'
5,'My new favorite hotel!','I\'ve heard about Hudson hotel for quite some time and have seen Pictures of the gorgeous interior. This hotel does not disappoint! \r\nLets get the negatives out of the way  The rooms are rather small, this is to be expected of NYC hotels.\r\nThe positive attributes of this hotel are quite a few. First is the location. Just around the corner from central park! After grabbing a coffee I would start my day with a nice stroll through the park. \r\nThe hotel is just down the street from columbus circle subway station from which many lines intersect. \r\nI was most pleased with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. I found the guest experience manager, Kimberly, to be exceptional in every way! \r\nAs a frequent traveler I find many hotels lacking in real and substantive guest service. Hudson, and Kimberly proved to be a welcomed exception. If only more hotels had managers and staff like those at Hudson. \r\nI will absolutely return to this hotel!'
5,'I keep coming back for more!','So far i\'ve stayed at Hudson 4 times this year and I\'ll be going back on my next trip to NYC. Sure the rooms are small but who stays in the room when you have all of New York City to enjoy! Couple of years ago I had the misfortune of staying at the London NYC. While it\'s a beautifull hotel with spacious rooms, the service was BEYOND HORRIBLE. I was promissed better service on my next visit. Not only was the service still bad it actually got worse. Shame on me for going back.\r\nHudson is a refreshing change. The location is fantastic. Just steps from central park. On your way there pop into whole foods at the Time Warner building and pick up a light lunch to enjoy in the park. Or go around the corner for Oreo pancakes at the flame diner.\r\nMy favorite thing about Hudson is the staff. They\'re always gracious, friendly and professional. They remembered me as a returning guest on my second visit! The concierge always has great recommendations for me. If I ever need anything, Kimberly the guest experience manager, always goes above and beyond the call of duty. I wish more hotels had a Kimberly!\r\nI\'ll definitely'
1,'Horrible Service','Had a prepaid guaranteed reservation. Arrived after midnight and was exhausted because I had to work in the morning. There was one person working at the desk (and it is a big hotel). There is a long line with a lot of angry people. I waited a long time. It turns out when I got to the desk that there were no rooms available.....no explanation. I could wait an hour or I could take a room with a single bed. They could have handled this situation much better. There were families with young kids in the same situation.'
1,'Horrible Customer Service','I arrived at this hotel at midnight on July 28th with a confirmed reservation. There was a long line at the reception desk. I waited in line for close to two hours. They were overbooked and there were no rooms. There were a lot of angry people and one person working behind the desk. I was eventually given a substandard room at 2 am. I had to work the next day. The front desk person gave me a comp night to compensate for this ridiculous situation. He said he made a note in the system under my reservation number. He told me when I was ready to use the comp night to call the hotel with this reservation number and they would give me the comp night. I called the hotel tonight and it took me an hour of being transferred to 5 different people, disconnected, transferred to voice mailboxes etc... No one seemed to really know what to do or how to handle this. I finally spoke with the assistant manager who told me I was told the wrong procedure. He gave me this song and dance about how he needs to send a request to the general manager who has to have his assistant type a letter to send to me which should take a week. Really?????? I guess it is an assembly line procedure for this very complex process of providing a customer with a previously agreed upon comp night because the hotel did not have a room for a confirmed reservation. If this doesn\'t give you an idea of this hotels commitment to customer service. This hotel has some serious customer service issues.'
5,'Westin Times Square is the ONLY place to stay in NYC','The Westin TS has everything you could possibly want. The hotel is sparkling clean, our Heavenly bed was awesome, the staff was courteous and helpful in making sure we had everything we needed. We had a beautiful side view of 42nd St. We stayed on the Atrium Club level in a spacious room that had an Apple Desk Top, Flat screen TV, an ipod docking station that had radio and alarm.The room was spacious and we even had a window seat\r\nlarge enough to sit and read with a view of NYC,The room temperature was perfect. We awoke feeling rested and ready to start our busy day. There is also a Spa and a gym but we visit. Great place to stay even with children'
5,'The only place to stay in NYC','Once again a great stay in NYC at Westin Times Square. Service,hospitality,clean and great views. I love this hotel. Looking forward to staying there again..Bar 10 was terrific as well.'
4,'hotel bien placé','Le westin se trouve à time square , il est bien placé tant pour se promener sur time square le soir que pour diner .Bien entendu le revers de la medaille etant le bruit du quartier , choisir si possible les chambres sup à partir du 23 eme étage, ascenseurs reservés aux étages sup. Les salles de bains sont assez petites contrairement aux chambres et pas de flexible pour les douches , Nous n avons pas testé le shula \'s ,vous trouverez en face des restaurants pour prendre des petits dejeuners americains , quelques croissants pas trés bons.\r\nSi vous êtes des inconditionnels des petits dejeuners francais allez plus loin prés du rockfeller center , au pain quotidien c\' est une chaine qui sert de trés bonnes viennoiseries.\r\n!ATTENTION ! Si vous prenez internet l option payante de 15 $ par jour n est valable que pour 1 Ordinateur c est de l\' anarque!'
4,'bon emplacement','second sejour au westin times square , les chambres dans les etages superieures sont relativement grandes pour new york avec une tres belle vue\r\nil y a maintenant une possiblité de prendre un petit dejeuner starbuck \r\nau bar de l hotel avec café, croissant, pain aux raisins, muffins jus de fruit , c est bien\r\npar contre toujours la wifi payante 15 $ par jour et par appareil connecté cela frise le scandale vu le prix des chambres.'
5,'Great weekend at the Westin Times Square','My wife and I just got home from an amazing weekend at the Westin Times Square. We were upgraded to a room with a great view of the river (thanks to Jessica ) and Candice on the front desk did everything she could to make sure we had a wonderful weekend.\r\nIf you are looking for a hotel in New York City do not look further than the Westin Times Square .'
5,'Another great weekend at the Westin Times Square NYC','We just got back from another great weekend at the Westin Times Square.\r\nGreat location- one block from Times Square and it is close to the theaters and walking distance to great eating places.Thank you to Jessie and Candice for the great room with a view.\r\nIf you go to NYC-this is the only place to stay!!!'
2,'CONFIRM YOUR RESERVATION!!!!','Booked a Sat night in January on the web site. When I checked in August 11 th we were told that the rooms were sold out. They offered us a lower priced room but this was not what we reserved.whcih was a club level. Overall the hotel is clean. Front desk staff could not care less about us until we spoke to a manager who gave us money off the room. I would hesitate booking this chain since they overbook rooms.'
5,'A gem in the heart of Times Square','Being a New Yorker I have had the chance to stay at the good and the bad in the City. The old adage you get what you pay for is true here.We stayed at a club level room for my brothers 50th birthday and found this hotel fantastic. Not only were the rooms super clean the service was above expectations. We had a few drinks in Bar10 although very low key the bar tender and wait staff were friendly and courteous. The rooms in this hotel are much bigger than others like the W in the area. You don’t feel like you are in a closet. As far as convenience you are steps away from everything the area has to offer. Literally. We saw Young Frankenstein which was several doors away. Overall this hotel is in a class of itself. We are not high rollers but felt like kings for the weekend. and can’t wait to go back next year.'
5,'Great Hotel - Great Location','This was my first overnight stay in NY City and I was unsure of what to expect room wise (cleanliness / size). I heard NY City hotel rooms are small. The room was bigger than expected and very clean and modern. The room was a corner room with many windows. The bed was very comfortable. It was an easy walk to the Gershwin Theatre (and the Theatre District) on 51st street. Times Square was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. NBC Studios was about a 15 minute walk. The service at the Westin exceeded my expectations. The hotel employees and doormen provided many good tips on getting around the city and were very polite and helpful. \r\nThere may be hotels that are cheaper in NY City, but this hotel is worth the extra cost in my opinion. The hotel was clean, secure, and had a friendly welcoming atmosphere. \r\nIf my travels take me back to NY City, plan on staying at the Westin again. I would recommend this hotel to other travelers.'
5,'Second stay was as nice as the first','We just stayed at the Westin NY City again. We stayed at the Westin in March and returned for another trip to NYC. The Westin was first on our list of places to stay. We had a room on the 42 floor with a view of Times square. The staff saw that I stayed at the Westin before and kindly upgraded me to a higher floor with a better view of the city. The rooms were clean, spacious, and had appeared to be recently remodeled. Around the corner is a McDonalds, drug store, sub shops and souvenir stores. It’s just a few minute walk to Times Square, NBC Studio Tour, and The Empire State Building. We felt very safe staying at this location. \r\nUpon checkout, we were in a hurry to get to the Statue of Liberty tour. The staff saw we had time issues and quickly tagged our bags and held them in a locked room for us to retrieve later. We had a large fragile photo that we bought as a souvenir and they said not to worry, they would take good care of it. We were half expecting it to be damaged when we returned, but it was in perfect shape that evening when we retrieved our bags.\r\nThe staff truly went out of their way to look after our belongings, and it was greatly appreciated. \r\nThe next time we visit NY City, the Westin will be our first choice.'
5,'Great rooms in a terrific location','The room was very comfortable and larger than the space at comparable hotels. The room was quiet and clean.'
5,'Great location and hotel','The Westin is in a great location, convenient to theaters, shopping, and restaurants. The rooms are a nice size by NYC standards, and the staff was helpful.'
5,'Cant fault the westin','Went to the Westin in N Y august 2011 and I cant fault it for service,cleanliness,location and fantastic view.I liked so much im going back with my family june2012.'
3,'Westin Times square','I requested a room with a view via e mail with a lady called JESSIE whom I had requested and got a great room with on a previos trip before. When I got to the room it was a terrible view, with part of the decor of the outside of the hotel right across the window totally blocking my view.I went down to reception and asked to be moved to another room which the lady did so.We had a much better view but a strong smell coming from near the fridge,I opened it to find lasagne and a mouldy cake left in there if this hadnt have been our second room and the fact we were very tired I wouldve asked to be moved again but I just told reception that the fridge needed cleaning out and they sent someone to do it while we were out.The room was for 4 and we only ever had 3 towells and 3 drinking glasses.Just wasnt as good as my first experiance at the Westin.'
3,Brilliant!,'Great Christmas atmosphere, beautiful Christmas trees, festive music. Very Cody lobby when been out in the bitter cold!\r\nstarbucks access from hotel!!\r\nStaff helpful'
4,'Brilliant location','Have stayed here 3 times now. Each experience matches the other. Price per room has increased and decor looking grubby despite price increase.\r\nExcellent location for Times Square and broadway, saw \'Mary Poppins\' this time.\r\nWill return again next December without doubt. Would recommend this hotel, took my sister here for her 50th birthday last year.'
3,'Good spot, nice rooms average staff','I stayed at this property and to be honest was dreading it.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. The position was good, rooms quiet and it was in a very good state of repair.\r\nThe housekeeping however failed to clean my room one day despite very many reminders and the front desk staff were not great.\r\nOn balance I would stay again.'
3,'Nice hotel, rooms OK but dirty','I stayed here for a business trip and found long hairs on the bathroom floor. As I have very short hair I deduced that they were not mine.\r\nThis rather put me off this property and I did mention it to the front desk who merely said that I should have mentioned it when I found it (the hair).'
4,'Westin Times Square a Good Choice!','We made a last minute change to stay at the Westin after reading bad reviews about the Grand Hyatt, where we were originally booked. We got an excellent rate under a buy 2 nights get the third free promotion, which worked out to about $240/night for an Executive Club room. The location was great, just outside the heart of Times Square and an easy walk to theaters and great dining. With a family of 4, including 2 adults and 2 teens, the 400 SF room gave us plenty of room. The sizeable bathroom with its long mirror was large enough for all of us to do hair and makeup at the same time! We enjoyed having the club access with continental breakfast, daytime beverages and evening hors d\'ouvres, especially the Starbucks latte machine. Evening beer, wine, and airplane-size bottles of liquor are available for $5, which is not bad for NYC. (Tip: Request an empty refrigerator for your room to chill bottled waters and sodas from the club.) The only drawback to the room was the view. We were on the highest Club floor possible (16th) overlooking 8th St. which gave us a not so great view of adjacent buildings and some obstructed views of the Hudson River. While we heard occassional sirens and honking, the noise did not keep us up at night. Most other hotels place their Club floors higher up with better views and less noice. For us, the larger room size (400 SF vs. 310 SF) and Club access outweighed the better view. \r\nWe were able to check in a little early (2:00p.m.) and front desk service was good. Our experience with Service Express was inconsistent. We had to call 3 times to get robes delivered to our room, but the refrigerator was delivered promptly. One day, the room was still not made up at 5 p.m., but after calling, it was cleaned while we were at dinner. Another reviewer had complained about the business center charges incurred to print a boarding pass. The concierge handled that for us at no charge. All in all, we were pleased with our stay and would stay here again.'
5,'Great location and friendly service','The Westin New York at Times Square is in a prime location for theatres, restaurants and entertainment. The service is outstanding and all staff members that we encountered were eager to help with any of our needs. The view from our window was incredible and the location on a side street made it quieter than right in town.'
5,'Great Experience','This is our third stay a the Westin Times Square and we will be back. We thought that the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The location right off of Times Square cannot be beat.'
4,'Great location for US Open and Broadway plays','My wife and I go to NYC annually for the US Open. We have stayed at many hotels in the Times Square area. I like the Westin\'s location - one of the #7 subway stations is 1/2 block away. So, going to the Open is easy. The Westin is also located near the Broadway theatres. Going to a show after watching a Day session at the Open is also nice. \r\nI am Gold with Starwood. So, normally I get upgraded and also get a 4 pm check-out. For this stay, we had a promotional rate that included Continental breakfast. We did not get upgraded so our room was a Deluxe King room. For NYC standards, this room was average size. I have stayed in rooms a lot smaller. Two people could walk around the end of the bed without bumping into each other. The A/C was quiet and cool. We needed a 3 PM check-out and we got that. \r\nBreakfast was served in Shula\'s restaurant. The free items were: a bowl of fruit, assorted pastries, muffins, bread, orange juice or coffee. The breakfast was served by waiters and delivered promptly. Good quality, but was a little boring after 5 days in a row. \r\nFitness Center is on 23rd floor. It has nice views looking towards the harbor area. \r\nAlso, a Shake Shack is across the street. \r\nMy only negative issues came with Housekeeping. We had several problems, all of which we reported. We are not very picky travelers, but these were items that had to be reported. Finally, the Housekeeping Manager sent us a fruit and cheese tray, which was nice. \r\nOverall, I like the Westin and I will likely stay there again next year.'
4,'Repeat Stay during Labor Day Weekend','We attend the US Open tennis tournament each year and always stay in the Times Square area. Our favorite hotel has become the Westin. An entrance to the 7 subway can be reached without even crossing a street. The hotel is well located near all the theatres but still a few blocks away from the mass crowds of Times Square. Like most hotels in NYC, the rooms are small. We paid a little extra and had a corner room. This gave us views in 2 directions and a little more walking area in the room. It was worth the upgraded cost. As a Starwood gold member, they gave me an upgrade to a higher floor. The view was good, but not great. I can\'t rate the Westin a 5 star, even though I like it a lot, mainly because of the small size of the rooms. I have had other housekeeping issues but nothing significant. Also, the HVAC works very well unlike many of the less expensive chain hotels. I did not get the breakfast plan this time. It was too over-priced and there are reasonably priced options in the area, Westway, Europan and Crumbs. Also, Shake Shack is across the street for a quick dinner pick-up. Overall, I will probably stay here agan next year.'
3,'Great rooms, but not the usual Westin service','I stayed here with my husband for five nights over the new year. The rooms are up to the usual high Westin standard - spacious with plenty of storage and the beds and bathroom facilities are excellent.\r\nHowever, I don\'t know if the staff were all exhausted at the end of the year, but a whole raft of small things went wrong during our stay that indicated this place, especially housekeeping, was just not on the ball. We won\'t be going back.\r\nFirst we were sent to a room that was already in occupation, and waited ages in line to speak to the receptionist and have another room allocated. The second room was fine, but lacking some of the basics, like a Do Not Disturb sign, minibar price list, in-room breakfast card, mineral water and so on. Without the Do Not Disturb, someone from housekeeping decided to walk into the room about two seconds after knocking at 8.30am on New Year\'s Day - after we had waited until 4 for our room to be cleaned the day before. \r\nThe Times Square website provided more information about what was happening on New Year\'s Eve than the hotel did. This wasn\'t the kind of service I was expecting for $500 a night and though the room was good, the location was lacklustre and we\'d have been better off somewhere else.'
2,'Worse than I thought','In my recent review I indicated the price of a room here was $500. That was my mistake, it was £500 - at current rates that\'s double the price and really terrible value for money.'
5,'Great Hotel & Location','Just returned from the Westin at Times Square in NYC. Excellent hotel--very modern with good amenities & location..upgraded to a club level room using Starwood Points--worthwhile--great lounge with good breakfast and afternoon refreshments....would definitely stay here again--great bedding, modern bathroom, close to all broadway shows--very helpful concierge\'s desk--check in easy and friendly staff!'
5,'Excellent hotel...great service...location perfect','Excellent hotel at times square.....upgraded to concierge level.....good service and food....front desk helpful...very comfortable rooms'
5,'Westin at Times Square','An excellent hotel....have stayed here many times....great location, excellent service.....very comfortable rooms...concierge level service excellent...Shula\'s restaurant very good (expensive)......received late check-out which was very helpfu....will return again!'
5,'Outstanding hotel in all possible ways','This property has been a favorite of mine for several years . The location is handy to most places my daughter and I prefer to spend our time in the City . Our room is always spotless ,the amenities are very good quality ,room service is always prompt and the food very good . All staff is very pleasant and helpful . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great NY hotel experience .'
5,'Westin TImes Square Great Experience','This hotel is so well located for all things that I go to NY to experience . Very handy to Broaday theaters , fine restaurants , and shopping on 5th Avenue is also within walking distance . It is also an easy walk to The Museum of Modern Art .\r\nThe rooms are always well maintained . Any staff I have dealt with has been very professional and gracious .'
5,'Great place to stay, close to everything that I wanted','This is my 3rd stay in NY but it was the best. The hotel is close to shops, subway, theatres and I felt very safe.\r\nStaff in the hotel very helpful and polite. Room was very clean with ample space. We did eat one breakfast in the hotel but was rather expensive for what we got. Lots of small cafe\'s around the area for the same meal at a better price.\r\nHas a good sized lounge area, great for relaxing or chatting to people.\r\nDownside: Thought they could have had free access to internet in the lobby (apart from checking in) - it seemed rather expensive'
5,'Third visit - love this Hotel','We convinced our friends to choose this Hotel for a 5 night stay celebrating a 21st Birthday and we didnt fail to please them. The hotel upgraded us and sent a gift to our room to help celebrate. The room was on the 44th Floor and the views were out of this world. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. \r\nThe location of this Hotel is perfect for getting around the city.\r\n2 minor points: The shower was either cold or burning hot - we did ask the desk if they could get someone to look at it but nothing altered. Not a major problem but I was not about to scald myself! Plus the wardrobe was difficult to shut - it has come off the runners but we couldnt get it to stay on them. Maybe the rooms are getting a bit tired now and could do with a spruce up but I would still stay and advise people to stay in this great establishment.\r\nTop marks to the Manager and his staff :)'
5,Excellent,'Excellet hotel, with an excellent location, amaizing views from its rooms. It is a moderm bulding, rooms are small, like an another hotels in the area, but with every thing you need for a business/pleasure trip. Be carefull with the man in the door, he accepts tips from the taxi drivers, and then the taxi drivers give you a round to go to the airport.\r\nPeople in reception was correct.'
3,'Out dated','I was in this hotel in 2006 and I reported it as excellent. Last experience has not been the same. Rooms are out dated, and need to be upgraded.'
4,'Recommend Chef Frank - Safe for Kids with Food Allergies','This was our third trip to the Westin NY. Chef Frank and his team have been incredibly accomodating making kid-friendly, gourmet meals that are safe for my boys who have extensive life-threatening food allergies. He prepared daily menus for the boys and was even willing to pack picnic lunches to allow us to tour the city. This has allowed us to travel worry-free to NYC. The rooms are clean, as well - which have been great as we have environmental allergies too.\r\nAlthough there were less expensive options available - keeping our kids safe is huge and Chef Frank and his team took (and take) such good care of us.'
5,'Chef frank, chef Alex, chef Baz and manny (waiter) rock!','We had an amazing stay (our 6th in 3 years). Chef frank, chef Alex and chef Baz cooked amazing meals that were tasty and lovely for our food allergic boys. They went so far above and beyond, finding new products that are safe and yummy. The boys had waffles for the first time!\r\nManny and our other waiter (I forgot his name but he has taken care of us every trip for dinner) took wonderful care of us.\r\nThe entire food/ restaurant team kept the boys safe and well fed- which allowed us to be relaxed and happy and free to enjoy the city'
5,'Exceptional Consistent Experience Every Time','The Westin is my preferred hotel in the city. The rooms are spacious and the amenities are unmatched, including the heavenly bed and shower. The staff is always friendly and helpful. It has the good energy that Times Square generates but it is a little comfort oasis on its own.'
5,'Best hotel in the city for experience and consistency','I continue to be impressed with The Westin at Times Square. We must use a corporate travel agency and I am given the option of other hotels in the area but choose the Westin everytime. The hotel staff is very supportive and consistent in their service, always ready to provide their best service. I have never had an issue with this hotel in the five plus years I have been traveling to the Big Apple. The rooms are spacious and the room service is great.'
5,'Super Lage - 1A Hotel - Wiederholungsgefahr','Das Hotel liegt 270 43rd W.... nur wenige Gehminuten zum Times Square, zum Broadway und ins Theaterviertel. Subway ist um die Ecke, genau wie diverse Cafe\'s, Bars, Restaurant. Zum Hudson River sind es ca. 15 min zu Fuß. Optimale Lage für alle, die das erste Mal nach Big Apple fahren. Der Service im Hotel könnte nicht besser sein! Ich war einfach nur begeistert. Der Concierge Peter ist extra zu erwähnen - einer der nettesten Menschen, die ich je getroffen habe. Ebenso der Kellner Don - man hat bei ihm das Gefühl, einen persönlichen Butler zu haben... Einfach nur schön\r\nDas Hotel hat seit einigen Monaten einen deutschen Manager, was einige Dinge erleichtert, wenn man gar nicht mehr mit dem Englisch weiterkommt. \r\nIch hatte ein Einzelzimmer im 35. Stockwerk mit Blick auf den Hudson River. Sehr sauber, ein super schöner Blick zum Hafen und zum Times Square. \r\nExtras - wie z.B. einen gewünschten Bademantel - wurde unverzüglich und kostenfrei aufs Zimmer gebracht.'
5,'Wiederholungstäter - aus Überzeugung','Der Empfang war wieder sehr herzlich und sehr persönlich. Das Hotel Management ließt mir ein Tablett mit Rotwein, Käse und Obst aufs Zimmer bringen - mit persönlichen Begrüßungsworten. Ein wunderbar weicher Bademantel hing im Bad, die Westin Dusch- und Badezusätze standen bereit - was will ich mehr?\r\nDer Blick aus dem 44. Stockwerk war atemberaubend - alles zusammen wieder ein Erlebnis.\r\nDas Frühstück im Shulas war ein Erlebnis - sowohl kulinarisch als auch durch das Personal. Don begrüßte mich mit Namen und war sehr darauf bedacht, dass es mir gut ginge... Damit habe ich nicht gerechnet - danke schön.\r\nIch kann dieses Hotel sehr weiter empfehlen - nicht nur wegen der zentralen Lage - sondern vor allem weil das Personal in diesem Hotel es versteht, dass der Gast ein Gast ist - und nicht nur jemand, der Geld bringt! \r\nIch komme wieder - ganz sicher und gern und ich hoffe sehr, dass es länger sein wird als eine Woche. Es ist soooo schön bei Euch im Westin!'
5,'Drei Mal ist Bremer Recht und es wird auch noch ein viertes Mal geben','Ich war das dritte Mal in 9 Monaten im WESTIN NY und kann nur sagen, es war wunderbar dort. \r\nIch möchte mich noch mal an alle zukünftigen Besucher dieses Hotels richten: \r\nBitte, wenn ihr dort Probleme habt - egal welche - wendet Euch an die Rezeption und fragt nach einem Manager, der deutsch spricht. Ein Manager ist Deutscher und hilft wirklich bei allen Problemen - ob die Visa nicht mehr geht, die Amexcard verschwunden ist, der Wasserhahn tropft oder man einfach mehr Handtücher braucht- fragt nach ihm Er ist einfach perfekt! (thanks to someone very special)'
4,'Nice place to stay','The Westin NY is a nice hotel. The staff was very helpful and provided excellent service. The check-in process was flawless and well staffed and managed. The only challenge we had upon check-in was the limited access to the front of the hotel. Several taxis and other vehicles were positioned to make it very difficult to get into the hotel. The hotel has a reduced entrance for vehicles than other comparable hotels. The hotel is in a good location, but does not have Times Square views or access like some of the other hotels in its class. Our hotel room was a very good size and was very clean. Our room had a view of older office buildings, but had a nice window that was easy to open to allow fresh air into the room. The Heat/AC system injects fresh air into the room which is extremely nice. The room was very well appointed and also included safe, Apple iMac, large LCD TV, and lots of space for our luggage and accessories. The bathroom was very good size, but has very limited shelf and counter space. The shower was equipped with double shower head configuration. The Westin provided nice robes for guests. The bed comfort was amazing and provided a very comfortable and restful nights of sleep during our stay. We were very pleased with our stay and while we would prefer a hotel directly on Broadway, the short walk to Broadway is fine. The hotel has a Regal movie theater inside the building at street level. We enjoyed our stay and recommend this hotel as an option for your next stay in NY.'
5,'Great Hotel in Great Location, Highy recommend!','Westin Time Square is a great hotel in a great location. Fantastic staff, very comfortable rooms, helpful staff (except dudes out front).\r\nWIFI is not free... but you can pick up Starbucks free WIFI in lobby or outside lobby next to Chevy\'s...\r\nWest Way Diner is one block down on 9th avenue for breakfast (just like Seinfeld), go down 43rd to 9th hang a right an it\'s 50 meters on right...\r\nAlso, there is a great Italian brick oven pizza place on 44th (between 8th and 9th) I think it\'s called Don Giavonni\'s...next to an Irish Pub around the corner form the West Way Diner... good pizza.\r\nWatch out for the guys who call the cabs... I think they are crooked. Walk around the corner and get your own cab...'
5,'Continued Excellence!','Our 3rd trip to the Westin Times Square in the last year and we have experienced consistent excellent service and value.\r\nExcellent location, walking distance to everything around Times Square.\r\nMulti-plex movie theater next door, kept the teenagers busy during the blizzard this weekend (first snow in NYC since the Civil war)\r\nBreakfast at the West Way Diner (one block away on 9th ave) is a must, fast, good food, a true new york experience.\r\nVery good Chinese Rest. a couple of blocks down 8th called Chef Yu\'s, I think it is on the corner of 8th and 35th...\r\nBrick oven pizzza around the corner on 45th, called Don Giavonni\'s... only takes cash. Try the garlic knots.\r\nHad dinner at Crispo\'s in the Village on West 14th... very good Italian rest. $7.50 cab ride from the Westin. Good carbonara, all chicken dishes good, kids liked pasta and meatballs...\r\nThey charge for WIFi but you can pick up Starbucks in the lobby... or out next to Chevy\'s (just outside the lobby).\r\nIf you have a large group and need a taxi they will offer you an SUV... DO NOT TAKE THE SUV... it is a ripoff... take 2 taxis, you will save money. The SUV\'s are not metered and are unregulated... it is a scam. They wil charge you 4X what a taxi charges.\r\nRipley\'s museum is a ripoff...\r\nNat Sherman\'s cigar store on 5th and 42nd is one of the best cigar stores in the world... Walking distance!'
4,'Nice experience at the Westin','My husband and I stayed at the Westin last weekend. It was our second time there. First time we had Executive Suite which was hugh and very nice. It was summer at that time so the prices were alot cheeper. Last weekend we stayed in a standard room on the 12th floor. The accomodations were more than adequate and the bed is just so comfortable. We were pleased. The room is a nice size. The bathroom leaves alot to be desired with the metal sink and rolling cart. That is the only complaint. Everything was very clean.\r\nwe got into the city at about 11:30 on a Saturday and we were able to check in immediately which was nice.\r\nThe staff was extremely friendly and accomodating and the location can\'t be beat.\r\nI will definitely stay there again.'
5,'Another Great Stay at the Westin','We just returned from 3 nights at the Westin and we had a great stay. It was my birthday celebration. We asked for early check in and arrived at 12 noon to find our room ready. We had a corner room on a high floor. We had a view of the Hudson and the City. We could open the windows which created a wonderful cross breeze and nothing flew in. The Westin Heavenly bed was comfortable. We also have one at home. The staff was friendly and housekeeping did a good job. In addition we got a very good rate. We always come back there as we like the location, the beds and the friendly staff. Continental breakfast was good which included fruit, hot oatmeal, rolls and toast, coffee and juice. The baggage check in is very organized and also the outside attendents are there to get you a cab all through the day and night. We say we should try another place but we are just so satisfied at the Westin.'
4,'Excellent place to stay only.','My wife and I stayed for 4 days we found the Westin in a great location right in the middle of Times Sqaure the Subway and other interesting places. \r\nThe room was very nice and clean and spacious. We were on the 27th floor and my wife noticed a wine glass outside our room in a corner when we arrived and it stayed there until we left, we both thought that the room cleaners would have seen it and removed it but it stayed there, its probably still there. \r\nThe restaurant and bar prices are very high compared to the other eateries and bars around the hotel so I would not recommend eating or having a drink in the hotel. As our tour guide said  Go west when wanting real New York prices for food and drinks. \r\nWe are returning next Christmas and we will be staying again at the Westin only because of the location. \r\nAnother criticism is the internet, $15 for 24 hours is a joke, being guests it should be free especially if I am paying for expensive drinks in the bar. But dont worry McDonalds and Starbucks are right out the front and there internet is free as well as some of the bars. \r\nOverall: Great location, expensive food and drinks and no free internet, staff very friendly.'
4,'Nice hotel but not coming back','When I reviewed this hotel in January 2011 on Trip Advisor I recieved a message through Trip Advisor from Jessie K who is the assistant to the General Manager of The Westin Mr Terry Lewis. This message stated that when I rebook to return in January 2012 to contact Jessie K who would look after us. I contact Jessie K and received an email in March 2011 stating,Hi Andrew! I have you both upgraded to the upper floor (above the 40th) facing Times Square. Both rooms are adjacent to each other. All set! \r\nWe arrived on the 10th January 2012 and we were put on the 28th floor I questioned the front desk staff about the email we received from Jessie K and they had no idea about any upgrade. I requested that Jessie K contact me and I also sent her an email, the next morning I was contacted by Adam the Duty Manager and he said that there had been a mistake made and we would be moved to a higher floor. I spoke with him at the front desk and he could only move us to the 37th floor to room 3709 and my parents were put in room 3742 which was on the other side of the building. We asked for a fridge to be put in both rooms for medication and he said it would be no charge but we were both charged for the fridge at check out. Jessie K however did not bother to contact me via phone or email, so much for an upgrade to above the 40th floor as per her email. I was told by Adam that the hotel was full which is understandable but I recieved the upgrade email from Jessie K on the 31st March 2011 before they were full. \r\nThe hotel itself is in a good location near Times Square the staff are friendly except for the bar waitress when we asked for service and were told to wait, the bar prices are expensive, there is no free WIFI anywhere in the hotel including the bar. The laundry prices are expensive we got charged $90.00 for six underpants, five pairs of socks and a pair of jeans. \r\nThe rooms are neat but dated, the bathroom is like a prison bathroom a stainless steel bowl, a mirror, toilet and shower, there is no storage in the bathrooms. \r\nDo your research there are a number of big name hotels around Times Square. When we return in January 2013 we wont be staying at the Westin again. Jessie K made comments that she could not follow through on and then she could not even call or email me to apologise.'
5,'Well worth It!','Loved our stay here - we were on the 39th floor and had a fabulous view of 42nd St. The location is excellent - 1 min to Times Square but once you turn the corner you feel removed from the hustle & bustle so it feels quite peaceful. If NYC could ever be described as that!\r\nThe room was exactly as described and the beds do live up to the heavenly title. We tried Shulas and weren\'t disappointed - would recommend this hotel to anyone.'
5,'Love it!','I have stayed in the Westin many times over the last 5 years & LOVE the place. I have never had a problem with any part of the hotel. The members of staff are always happy to help. The Beds in the Westin are just FAB. The views are amazing, we could see the Empire State Building from our room, which made us all happy. We have eaten in the steak house in the hotel & it was the best steak I have ever had!!! You are right next to Times Sq, so bang in the middle of it all!'
3,'A let down since our last stay...','We have stayed in the Westin 8 times over the last few years, but havent stayed since 2009... I have never really had a bad thing to say about it until now... \r\nThey have really let the hotel go down hill. It is now a 3.5 star. \r\nThe beds are still good, but the sheets are not white anymore- more grey!\r\nThe towels are no longer fluffy- more hard!\r\nThe walls in & out the rooms need re painting.\r\nIts more like a Travel Lodge.\r\nWe had room 2735- great view of the ESB..& city, but other than that it was basic.\r\nAlso on the day we left our daugther got 2 bites.... dont know from where, but she got them!!\r\nI wont return to this hotel again, which is a shame as I have told so many people to go here...\r\nShula\'s steakhouse is great.... & for breakfast there is a diner on 9th called the westway... about 3mins walk... great diner... everytime we are in NYC we go there...'
5,Brilliant,'Booked this holiday through virgin holidays; a deluxe room which ended up being on the 40th floor with views of the Empire State Building to the left and the Hudson to the right.\r\nFlights with virgin landed around 3pm but i had notified the hotel prior to our arrival that we would be late arriving. Got a taxi from JFK to the airport and checked in straight away, found our room, changed of clothes and straight out again.\r\nHotel is on 43rd street but would recommend walking around to 42nd street and walking to Times Square that way, more lights and people than 43rd street. Close proximity to Times Square and the subways which we used about 4 times a day. \r\nRoom has a coffee machine stocked with complimentary starbucks coffee, although there is a starbucks in the complex underneath the hotel next to the cinema, which we went to every morning for breakfast before venturing out.\r\nWould recommend this hotel as its close but not in the middle of Times Square, central location for tourists and rooms are amazing, including the views and beds.'
5,'We loved it...again.','This was our second trip to New York City. (last time we visited in the Summer) We decided to stay in the Westin again because it was close but not too close to Times Square and was close to the main subway stations. \r\nWe had a standard twin room and had a view of the Empire State Building again. As a base, this is a brilliant hotel, although we didn\'t stay in it that much, I would still return.'
5,'The best there is in NYC.','We stayed at The Westin recently and cannot recommend it highly enough.\r\nAll the staff members were extremely courteous and polite and nothing was a bother to them.\r\nOur room was upgraded and we had the use of The Atrium, an excellent facility providing breakfast and snacks throughout the day.\r\nThe beds were certainly heavenly and the room extremely well appointed.\r\nThe bathroom had an excellent shower with twin heads and the bedroom was ...... really just a home from home!\r\nThe location could not have been better, being just a short walk from Times Square and Broadway.\r\nWe would not consider any alternative accommodation in NYC and hope to use this hotel on our next trip to New York.\r\nAll in all..... The Westin is as good as it gets!!'
5,'Second time around for Westin New York','We\'ve just returned home this morning from another excellent stay at Westin @ Times Square and felt the need to post another up-to-date review.\r\nWell,what can we say?\r\nWe arrived here on Thursday,having travelled from Belfast with our two teenage boys on their first visit to NYC.\r\nWhat a time they have had............the accommodation was absolutely first class with a suite on the 36th floor allowing us excellent views over the city.\r\nThe hotel staff,without exception.were always most pleasant and willing to help with our every need and could not have done anyting more for us to make our stay any more enjoyable.\r\nBreakfast was available for us in The Atrium lounge and such a variety of choice from porridge,through cereal and muesli to fresh fruit and yoghurt and all types of fresh breads .\r\nWhat a drinks selection too!! Lovely Starbucks coffee was available on tap and the variety of teas there was second to none.......a great way for the four of us to set off on our adventures around the city.\r\nDinner in Shula\'s on the ground floor was an excellent experience too with four tasty steaks to feed our hungry mouths after returning for the evening!\r\nAll in all our stay at the Westin couldn\'t have been any better and many thanks to the staff there,particularly Jesse who have made us feel most welcome.\r\nWe would have absolutely NO hesitation in recommending The Westin New York at Times Square to anyone who likes to feel wanted and appreciated and who enjoys excellent standards of service.\r\nWell well done to everyone there.........we will DEFINITELY make a return trip.'
4,'Rooms need updating!','Have stayed in this hotel several times, however this time around the room felt worn and slightly tatty, Walls were stained, paint was peeling and the shower was slighty rusty. The room was still very clean just old and needs a up date if still wants to be classed as a 4*! The lobby was still beautiful and staff were great apart from one lady at check in was slightly rude.'
3,'Tired rooms need redecorating','I have stayed at this hotel several times over the years and always recommend Starwood hotels, however on my last visit I felt that the rooms had become very tired and scruffy. I found stains on the walls and the corners of the rooms and bathroom were not the cleanest. I am very disappointed as I do love this hotel but would not stay again unless they redecorated, I will now stay in the W times square. Also the lady on check in was very rude and sarcastic which was surprising as the staff are usually very friendly. The young man with the cool white hair who helped us book our theatre tickets was fantastic.'
3,'Good location in midtown but needs some renovation','The hotel was well located near Central Park and had good access to Times Square and Midtown. Its right next to Radio City, MOMA and the 6th Avenue Financial District. The room had a nice big flat screen TV but because the hotel is very popular there is some wear and tear visible all over the hotel. \r\nWhen I checked out I was shocked that for $3.50 per item they would keep luggage in a separate area of the lobby. I had a 30 minute wait between checking out at midday and my car to the airport and they charged me for keeping my case. I have never been to a hotel where they charge for keeping luggage and I was very disappointed they did.'
1,'Terrible Third Time','This is the 3rd time in 18months I have stayed here, always for work and it\'s getting worse each trip. It started as a reasonable business hotel in a good location and has now become a punishment for people staying here.\r\nIn my earlier reviews I complained about the expensive in-room wifi (this should be free!) and the outrageous charge to hold your bags once you check out.\r\nThis set the precedent of decline and on this trip I discovered that the minibar has disappeared. It\'s now a $35 charge to have this \'service\' and the tea and coffee facilities have also disappeared. Frankly this is a disgrace. \r\nI will never ever stay here again. There are so many other hotels in New York that treat you like a paying hotel guest rather than a lodger who is late with the rent.\r\nIn addition, the bathroom suite is old and hasn\'t had the mould cleaned properly around the bath. The decor is dated and in places broken and needing secured to the walls and floor.'
5,'Very good - especially for NYC','Very nice hotel in mid-town Manhattan. Large rooms by NYC standards. A little on the pricey side but you can\'t beat it for location and convenience. Rooms were very clean and service good. Taxi lines during peak times are a nightmare as with most larger hotels. Will definitely return here.'
2,'Great location but horrible service','This is on eof the most centrally located hotels in midtown yet consistently has haphazard service. The desk personnel checking me in were absolutely surly. No welcome, no how was your trip in, not even -how many keys would you like. Then our room was adjacent to a supply closet where at 7am each morning all the housekeepers promptly gathered for loud chit chat and stories. The interior both looks and smells old. At 300 a night, there are many new competitors on the block w newer facilities and actual service! Not going back to Hilton again!'
4,'Also called Hilton New York','I was attending a course at this hotel and was skeptical about my stay given reviews on this site. I was pleasantly surprised and wanted to mention it.\r\nMy check in was prompt and pleasant. (Frankly, all dealings with the front desk personnel were pleasant including cashing large bills). My room was clean and comfortable. It was quiet with virtually no noise from outside or neighboring rooms.\r\nThe wait for the elevators was not lengthy (longer waits at the Benjamin and Wynn in Las Vegas). \r\nThe servers at the course I attended were most helpful and gracious as was the cleaning staff (for our room). The concierge was also very helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants.'

5,'Holidays at the Hilton','Dear Ms. Cahill:\r\nMy family recently stayed at the New York Hilton. We had an amazing time both in the hotel and out. The accommodations were amazing, warmand comfortable. The service was impeccable. From the executive lounge staff, to housekeeping; from the front desk (love that you let the pregnant women who work there sit down) to the parking attendants, we were treated warmly and courteously.\r\nWe have been visiting your hotel for about ten years now, myself dovetailing the weekend stay with the Symposium Medicus conferences that you allow to be held there during the holiday season. I love that I can combine professional needs with an amazing hotel stay in\r\nmid-town Manhattan. The proximity of mid-town, Central Park and Rockefeller Center only heightened the excitement and fun.\r\nThe New York Hilton has become (for one weekend a year) our New York home and we feel so at home when we stay there. Thanks for the classiness, the comfort and the attention to detail. We look forward to many more visits! Oh, and thanks for letting us bring our schnauzer with us..she is family too!'
5,'Returning home','Every year in December my family and I stay at this hotel. It is always within the two weeks before Christmas and usually around Hanukkah. The hotel is warm, inviting and feels homey and elegant all at the same time. They are kid and pet friendly and we always bring our dog! The Executive Lounge has been moved downstairs around the corner from the lobby bar and has a modern look. They continue to renovate some of the floors; the upper level was not complete when we were there. We had our last meal at the restaurant within the hotel as it is also slated for renovation and was closing today, relocating to the large bar/sitting area that runs along 54th street until it reopens in about 5 months. I\'m sure it will look awesome and look forward to seeing it next year. The staff is amazing and we look forward to going back each year. Thank you Kelli and Renee in Marketing; thank you to all the regulars we see every year; thank you Hilton for another wonderful stay! It\'s so nice to have a temporary home in the heart of Manhattan so we can stroll around and shop/visit the holiday decorations.'
4,'Great Location and Fine Hotel','The location is great for both shopping, theatre and the arts. Time Square is only ten minutes away on foot. The rooms are surprisingly not small. It is very clean and there is security at night. Side doors are all locked all the time now. There is just one disappointment. Hilton Honors Gold card holders often get to use the amentities of the executive floor. At this hotel, you will just get a Starbucks coupon for a pastry and coffee for breakfast and no executive floor previlege unless you have Hilton Honors Diamond ranking. Disappointing but at $209, I feel pretty good about it.'
4,'Nice NY Hotel','This is a large NY hotel but it lives up to what you may expect from a Hilton in a large city. The front desk was very efficient as were the concerge, bell station and luggage storage office. We had to store some bags for a colleague arriving later. It was perfectly taken care of with good retrieval instruction and protocol. The rooms was pretty good for size for a NY hotel. The bathroom was of good size and the bed was ultra comfortable. Everything worked and the process of getting a cab was also efficient. The breakfast at the coffee shop while pricy was also good. If you can get into this hotel at around $250, it is a good value. At around $300, it is fair and at over $375, you should shop. The location across the street from Radio City Music Hall and just one block north of the Rockefeller Cener is excellent.'
5,'NY Hilton...WOW!','We found this hotel to be an excellent location, and a beautiful hotel, as well. It\'s situated at W. 54th St. and 6th Ave. a block from Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art, 3 blocks from Broadway, near Times Square...right in the middle of exciting happenings. One block away, you can catch the hop-on, hop-off buses to sample various areas of the city. The hotel proper has a Marketplace Cafe, for informal dining, offering continental, or full breakfasts,as well as Japanese & other international foods. It\'s open for Breakfast, Lunch, & Dinner. We didn\'t sample the Etruscan Italian Restaurant, also on-site.\r\n We also enjoyed a Harbor Circle cruise, which lasts about 3 hrs, with spectacular views of the skylines, and a lot of information.\r\nThe hotel has a fitness center, wireless internet, and airport check-in kiosks. It has recently had an 85 million dollar refurbishing, and our room was beautiful, and the beds are truly heavenly.'
5,'Additional Comments','I would just like to add a couple of comments to my review dated Sept. 17.\r\nAbout the long lines for check-in, they do have a special check-in desk for Gold & Diamond Hilton members. As gold members, we received a lovely refurbished room, and access to the members lounge.\r\nWe found all the staff we encountered to be very friendly and helpful.\r\nThe 5 nights following our stay in the hotel room, we were in the Hilton Club residences, which differs considerably from the hotel proper,'
4,'excellent location and room','Stayed at this hotel in early June 2007, after much research on Trip Advisor and other sites and was not disappointed. Booked a deluxe room, on 30th floor, well above most traffic noise. The room was spotless, with everything in working order, very comfortable bed, and good ventilation (even if the windows are closed). Used the kiosk in the lobby to check in, and the zip check out on the phone to check out, thus avoiding lines at the desk (which didn\'t look long, actually). Easy 1.5 block walk to MoMA and Folk Art Museum. Ten dollar cab ride to the Metropolitant Museum of Art. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance, including Bobby Flay\'s Bar Americain. Food at the hotel is pricey-- 18 bucks for a burger-- but there are smaller spots for breakfast, lunch right across from the hotel. The fitness facility could use a rowing machine, but has plenty of newer treadmills and ellipticals, as well as free weights and a nice locker room.'
4,'Well priced for NYC in a great location','Recommend forking up a little more for the Executive level floors - quieter, and you probably save time and money grabbing breakfast and late afternoon snacks in the lounge. However, watch the drink prices! I paid $15 for a mediocre glass of white wine; could have waited and spent that on something better at dinner. Could have been a little cleaner, but was fine.'
4,'Very Good for Hilton','We used American Express points to convert to Hilton Honors points. Room had been renovated. Great shower and bathroom.\r\nKing size bed in deluxe room on 16th floor. A very good nights sleep. Very nice decor in rust and gold. Great TV and couch.\r\nOnly negatives were:\r\n1. Previous nights coffee cups and glasses were left outside the doors in the entire hallways from 1 PM when I checked in until the following day at 11 AM when we checked out. \r\n2. Maids hung around the hallway and in one room waiting for what appeared to be tips.\r\n3. Wooden furniture in the room was severly nicked in four places. \r\n4. At this property, I was told that using points you can not get a room with breakfast included or on the club floor. Breakfast in the NY Market Restaurant was obscenely overpriced. Two coffees, one juice, two bagels with cream cheese and jelly was $30.00 plus tax and tip.'
5,'Excellent midtown hotel','Very happy with the hotel. Very nice room, nicely furnished, clean and guest friendly.'
5,'VERY GOOD HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION!','Our second visit to NYC. We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square the first trip but I received a great deal via Hilton (on two executive rooms) this time out and we were not dissappointed.\r\nCheck in was quick, the kids had been placed on a different floor and that was changed (with a smile) within seconds! The rooms were clean, spacious and had all the bells and whistles!\r\nThe executive lounge was smartly furnished and well stocked at breakfast time.\r\nThe room service was a little pricey but the food and the service were great!\r\nThe hotel is about five minutes walk from Central Park and the same to Times Square, it is a great location! If you can get a good rate, this place is perfect!'
5,'Awesome stay','I have stayed at this hotel twice now. I have been extremely pleased with the service, the comfort of the rooms and especially the location. \r\nThe hotel was very accommodating for all of our needs. We checked in quickly, our room was very spacious with a stocked refrigerator, the beds were comfortable, and the room was very clean. The staff was very prompt with any needs that we had. We had to extend our stay, due to bad weather, and the reception desk was very helpful.\r\nThere are a couple of restaurants on site and a couple of bars/lounges. We didn\'t eat at the restaurants, the prices were a little high, so for breakfast, we exited the front of the hotel and headed to the left down to a great diner called Astro Diner, which is about a block away. This is a great breakfast with reasonable prices. Much more reasonable than the hotel. \r\nThere is a Starbucks coffee attached to the hotel, in the back, which was very convenient. There\'s also a parking garage, which was reasonably priced. \r\nThe best part of all is that the location is prime. It is a couple of blocks away from Radio City, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue is just a block away and Grand Central Station & Times Square are just a few blocks away. You can\'t beat the location!'
5,'My favorite NYC Hotel','I have stayed at multiple hotels in NYC and this hotel is by far my favorite. The service, amenities, size of the rooms, comfort of the rooms and overall satisfaction is second to none. I am treated with top notch service here and the staff really cares about your comfort. I highly recommend this hotel. You can\'t beat the location, it\'s a 5 minute walk to Rockefeller, 5th Avenue, etc.'
4,'3.5 stars','I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could- it\'s definitely somewhere better than average but not quite very good.\r\nThe hotel lobby was chaotic but check in staff were polite and efficient. The hallway seemed a little dated so my expectations weren\'t super high for the room. But the room seemed updated and was pleasantly appointed, very clean, comfortable bed, good pillows- bathroom was on the smaller side but was fine. Motion activated LED floor lights were really nice, especially when one person is sleeping and one person wants to get up without disturbing them. The 10th floor wasn\'t too noisy, we slept great. \r\nThe restaurants in the lobby were packed but didn\'t have great reviews so we grabbed dinner somewhere else. The complimentary breakfast the next morning left a lot to be desired- but it\'s NYC and there are way better options for breakfast anyway!'
3,'Not as great the second time around','We stayed here for the second time this year, and we discovered that there is a BIG difference in rooms at this hotel. Previously, we were happy with the updated room, fixtures and furniture and were expecting the same type of room this time. Sadly, we were mistaken and were in a frumpy, old looking far from updated room. It had some useless locked cabinet that could have been formerly been a minibar in it, the bathroom was like something out of a hotel you\'d find in any average hotel in small town USA, not a shiny Hilton in Manhattan. The location is still great, the staff was ok, but we now know for next time to ask for an updated room.'
3,'Delivers on modest expectations','First, understand that hotel rooms in NYC are routinely a terrible value vs nearly all other locales. Second, don\'t stop looking for a better price until you\'ve exhausted all avenues. Trying to book 3 nights between Christmas and New Year\'s on less than a week\'s notice, I found nothing but $450-$550/nt anywhere near midtown Manhattan. Just when I was ready to give up I tried NYC.com and found the Hilton New York for $329/nt for Executive Double on upper floor with free breakfast. Being the busiest week of the year, the main lobby was packed but the Executive floors have separate registration area and breakfast....that alone was worth it. Parking was $48/day, about norm for that area. Location was perfect for walking to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave, Central Park, etc. Maid service was good and room was generally nice. Dishes laying in hallway were no surprise given the crowds...again, know what to expect and remember you\'re there for the city sights, not for the nice hotels. If you\'re looking for a better experience, try The Muse, The Library, or the other boutique hotels nearby...all very nice if you\'ve got only 2 people or a small family. If you have family of 4, you\'re stuck with one of the bigger chains.'
2,'Poorly managed','Have stayed here 4 or 5 times for business & pleasure. Property has great location and decent rooms but is so poorly managed that I\'ll stay elsewhere. Despite staying on executive floors you will have to deal with long lines for skimpy breakfast, understaffed registration desk, out of service elevators, etc. some staffers tried to compensate but it appears mgmt has given up, and the price no longer makes this a bargain.'
4,'Good Value, Good Stay','If you can book this hotel at a decent price, it is a great place to stay. I have been in many hotels in NYC, and for the right price this is one of the best options. Mostly good things to say about this hotel: Centrally located in Manhattan with decent access to the attractions and subway. The rooms are clean (we had two rooms) and mostly quiet (depends on your neighbors). Plenty of amenities in the hotel, such as workout facilities, WiFi, etc. \r\nThe bad things about this hotel are mostly picky items, but worth mentioning. Upon checking into one of the rooms, the mini-bar had a half-consumed coke and toothpaste marks in the sink. Despite pointing this out upon checking in, they still tried to charge me for the coke. It is NY, and you will hear honking horns all through the night. Make sure you use the do not disturb sign. Otherwise, you will receive multiple interruptions, such as room-check, extra coffee/tea check, etc. The TVs are flat screen wide screens, but the software and remote are horrible. Changing channels is a challenge (huge delay). The gym is $20/day and the internet is $15-$20/day. Finally, the staff varied form very nice to very rude. \r\nI almost gave this hotel 3/5 stars, but compared to other options in NYC it deserves 4/5. I would stay here again.'
5,'Repeat business','This was my second time staying at the Hlton New York, and this stay was perhaps better than the last. The room was mostly clean, well appointed, comfortable, and relatively quiet. The only issues were a few dirty spots that the cleaning staff missed prior to my arrival (e.g. dirty toilet) and some issues with a neighbors TV (too loud and stuck on the Hilton Welcome channel for an hour at midnight). I was on the Hilton Diamond level, which seemed to have a little nicer redone look. The rooms were a little small, but normal for NYC. Even on the 31st floor I could hear the traffic noise pretty well. \r\nOtherwise, a great stay. \r\nI will certainly be back.'
5,'Hilton New York is SUPERB !!','I stayed at the Hilton NY , on Avenue of the Americas, from 25th May to 7th June\r\nThere were three in my party . two adults and with my young son ,aged only 3 weeks \r\nI loved it \r\nThe hotel is superb , large enough to give all the benefits you may need but small enough to really care \r\nThe executive lounge which is being redesigned is excellent and the staff top notch \r\ni got special help from AMY MORENO, the Hilton Executive Level Manager who was always so friendly and helped to me and my small family no end . NOTHING was too much for Amy, NOTHING \r\nI also got particular help from Hannelore , the Executive Officer at the hotel\r\nThere are a got to good hotels in Midtown NY but take my advise , stay at the Hilton, NY. \r\nYou wont be disappointed !!'
5,'Hilton New York does it for me !','I love New York City . What a place. The weather can be cold ( and I am from England ) but the people and the city make up for it , 100\%. \r\nI have only ever written a few reviews of hotels but i have to write something about the Hilton NY\r\nThere are so many good hotels in NYC , you can be spoilt for choice there . I have stayed at manyof them , in my time , BUT my honest opinion is that the BEST HOTEL in NYC , for value , location and general all round quality , is the HILTON NEW YORK , on 53rd and 6th Ave.\r\nI love it . Yes it is in Midtown and some people say you should stay in Soho or a more trendy area. I say forget that . Midtown is perfect \r\nThe staff are so helpful and friendly\r\nThe location is THE BEST you can want . Really top! Minutes from 5th avenue , Times Sq ( but not too noisy ) and a stone throw from Central park also \r\nA new change at the Hilton is the Executive Lounge, open from 7am to 11pm . It is one of the best Exec lounges of any Hilton and any hotel i have been to. Make sure you have lounge access with your room , it is worth its weight in gold \r\nthe manager of the lounge is Amy Moreno and she is wonderful. So welcoming .\r\nThe Exec lounge used to be on the top floor of the hotel . Yes the view was amazing BUT it meant you often had to get two elevators to get to the lounge . \r\nMark Lauer , the General Manager here , of this Hilton had a great idea to move the lounge to the lobby area. A master decision . Now , you can pop back from some shopping and sightseeing and stop at the lounge for a coffee without dragging yourself up to the 48th floor \r\nBETTER THAN EVER\r\nDo yourself a favour and stay at the Hilton NY. I wont stay anywhere else . It is one of my favorite Hiltons worldwide and one of my top hotels of any brand \r\nST , England'
4,'It is a fine, too busy hotel','My room was clean, cozy and everything worked. The lobby is so bustling as to be too busy. Parking the car was not all that easy and getting the luggage a trial. But the space is familiar to me, the location very central, and best of all... it is across the street from the best street dining in NY, two halal carts often called 53rd and Chicken (actually at the corner of 6th.) Great food for $6 meal. So how to complain? Fast walk to theatre, dining, and all of midtown. It\'s the NY Hilton, and that is just fine.'
4,'Ever busy, next to MOMA, expensive for every extra','I have stayed at the Hilton many times and it is usually as busy as can be. The amenities for Honors members with high status are not so hot, although since everything is so expensive that the free Continental breakfast (restaurant or to go at Starbucks) adds value, certainly. These are true NY prices here, with a high markup on every purchase or service.\r\nThe rooms are large for NY hotel rooms, with the bathrooms tighter. The spacious desk has a table underneath it that can be rolled out to double the usable surface for work, dining, or for kids to play on. That is a nice touch, especially for an extended stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable, including the beds. Not a great hotel for views from most rooms, although on the north side you can catch glimpses of Central Park if up high enough.\r\nThe elevators are pretty efficient at handling the crowds, and check-in is probably as efficient as it can be. Sometimes the taxi queue can be long. \r\nRight out the door are the famed halal chicken carts, with the one that is the original and longest line on the southwest corner. The southeast corner of the same intersection is a yet another branch of the same halal empire. Imitators abound. There is also a huge Duane Reade pharmacy/convenience store across the street and up a block, and you can get anything you needs there.\r\nThe hotel hosts lots of meeting and conventions, but is also an excellent place for tourists and visitors to stay. Close to theatres and Times Square, but not right in all the madness. Excellent dining all around -and Radio City and Carnegie Hall are each a five minute walk. You can enjoy some of the best entertainments of NY right in the area, and subway (R line) is a few blocks away.'
4,'good location','The Hilton New York is in walking distance to Central Park, Theater District, Times Square and all the glam shopping you could want. We stayed on the Club level. The rooms were very nice, spacious with very comfortable beds, not your typical tiny NYC hotel rooms. Aveda bath products were provided, mini bar and black out curtains. The walls are however paper thin. They have breakfast and happy hour every day for Club Level patrons. They also have a concierge service who can get you reservations to most places. This service is available to everyone at the hotel.\r\nThere is a ticket office who provides brokers tickets to all plays and sells tickets to attractions. Of course you pay more, but that\'s the way they do things in NYC. They have a nice bar and some resturaunts including starbucks. We didn\'t use any of these so I cannot comment on them. Of couse, summer is a very hot, touristy time to be in the city, but this is a great location, not too much street noise and very secure at nite. \r\nWe took a taxi here from LaGuardia for around $35. It\'s only about 30-45 minutes to/from depending on traffic.'
3,'Great Location','This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel. This time we stayed in the regular hotel room. I think everything could use an update, but as far as cleanliness and location this is a great place to unpack your suitcase. It is so close to Central Park and all the great shopping. There are lots of great places to eat within walking distance and the subway stop isn\'t far if you need it. Broadway is more of a cab ride for those dressing up and not wanting to walk that far. There is a ticket booth located in the hotel. We have purchased last minuite tickets there...you do pay about $50 more per ticket. It\'s pretty hassel free if you decide on something last minute. They also arrange tours and cars. We didn\'t do much but sleep and dress here so I can\'t really comment on the rest of the hotel. It\'s in a nice'
4,'Nice midtown option','This was my first stay at the Hilton New York, and I was pleased with it. I had a deluxe room, while some colleagues who traveled with me had the more standard room (booking on their website using my HHonors ID, I was quoted a price for the deluxe room that was for some reason significantly lower than what they were charged for their standard rooms, so I took that). While my colleagues did grumble a bit about their rooms, I can say that mine was very nice. It was nicely furnished, quiet, and very comfortable, and was quite spacious by midtown hotel standards. Also, I\'m not much of TV watcher (especially while traveling), but when I did happen to flip the TV on I noticed that virtually all the channels received were in actual, true HD--many hotels I\'ve stayed at recently seem to have mostly non-HD channels (often with poor signals) even though they have a nice HD TV in the room, so this was a nice change.\r\nObviously, this a very convenient location, in short walking distance to many midtown destinations, and with excellent access to the subway, taxis, and other transportation for more distant destinations downtown or uptown.\r\nAll in all, a pleasant and comfortable stay, friendly and efficient staff, and at a price that was not bad at all as compared to comparable midtown hotels. I would stay again.'
5,'Awesome NYC Hotel!!!!','This hotel was fantastic! I\'ve stayed in a few NYC-area hotels in the past in various mid-town locations (Times Square, etc.). This by far was my favorite hotel!! Check-in process was smooth, room was clean and updated, bed was comfortable, etc., etc.! Although we did not take advantage of many of the things this hotel had to offer (restaurants, etc.), we had a wonderful visit and this hotel is on my list of places to stay again next time I visit NYC!'
5,'LOVE this hotel!!!','We went to NYC to celebrate my son\'s 5th birthday and this was our 2nd trip to the Hilton New York. Once again, they exceeded my expectations! Not only were we able to check-in to our hotel earlier than the 3pm check-in time (at no extra cost), but we were also pleasantly surprised when Room Service called that they had something for my son. As a birthday gift to him, the front desk had Room Service bring up a tray of cookies, 4 pints of milk on ice, and a slice of cheesecake with fresh fruit on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it in chocolate around the plate -- WITH a candle that we could light so we could sing to him. I have to say the Hilton outdid themselves! This will be my hotel of choice from now on when visiting NYC!'
4,'Great Location','Great location, easy walking distance to Broadway Theaters. Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, quiet at night. Rooms could use some updating. Management responsive when problems did arise. Annoying time share desk in lobby. A nice deli across 53rd Street for cheaper food options. Would definitely stay there again.'
4,'2nd stay @ Hilton New York','Our 2nd trip to New York and we chose to stay at the Hilton New York again (lasted visited in May of 2010). Why? Well first off we had no problems with our first stay. In studying the prices, we found the room rate to be as good as it gets (although not cheap by any stretch). Location is good, just a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, the theater district and Rockefeller Plaza. Check in was quick and courteous, the room was clean and most importantly quiet at night. Paid a few extra dollars, $15 per night, for a higher floor which eliminated outside noise and improved the view. Money well spent. I can\'t comment on the other facilities, restaurants etc, but prices looked high. This is a big hotel. You won\'t get personal service unless your a frequent flier, but it served it\'s purpose as a home base for a 5 day stay in New York City.'
1,'I\'m through with this hotel (Diamond Member)','I\'ve stayed at this hotel many times in the past but I\'m finally done with it.\r\nThe property is simply too big while the staff and services have been cut to the bone. The elevators are a confusing nightmare The rooms are a baffling array of styles and standards - all very hit-and-miss. Diamond members are lucky to receive any special consideration. The Executive Lounge serves a very poor selection of food in a hurried, cramped, chaotic setting. A small glass of wine cost at the bar cost me $16.50 - this proved the final straw - I\'m moving to the Hilton Times Square....just so much easier to navigate'
1,'Give this place a miss','I decided to give this place another chance after my last dismal experience a few years ago. The Director of Sales had contacted me and had encouraged me to return - I promised her I would one day.\r\nMy room on the Executive Level (# 3942) was shockingly bad. The decor was extremely outdated; carpets were stained and there was black hair in the bath and on a pillow. There was no bottled water or cups to make coffee/tea in. \r\nThe location may be good but the quality of the rooms does not map to the hotel category.'
4,'Perfect Location and Size','I\'m a very picky traveler. I dont do quaint and charming and old smelly tiny rooms with their history...seems like lots of NY hotels fit this bill. The Hilton was modern enough but not overly trendy, very clean. Location was fantastic, walk to times square but not in the middle of the lights. Huge hotel, lots of people going in and out, didnt bother me much concierge was available to answer questions, google directions and a cab line right outside, subway few minutes away, Famous Halal cart across the street. Starbucks inside the hotel and lots of other amenities. Bed was very comfortable and my double room with 2 queens was very roomy, quiet and clean, what more can you ask for! Well i would ask it wont be over $300 a night..but this is NY what can u do.'
4,'Back again to the Hilton NY','My second stay two summers in a row. This time I had a refurbished room on the 21st floor. The room was very comfortable and the amenities nice, i loved the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries. The hotel was booked solid and i never had any problems with service, lines at breakfast or elevators or a feeling of overcrowdiness. Once again the price was ridiculously expensive, this is probably the most expensive basic room i have ever paid for $500 per night after taxes and fees and i have stayed at five star hotels all over the world. The Location is what i love the most, a few blocks from central park, a few blocks from times square/broadway, a few blocks from fifth avenue shopping, convenient to everything. I even enjoyed the frequent street closings in front of the hotel for parades, the president visiting nearby, there was always some activity going on. \r\nThere\'s a starbucks in the hotel but 2 better ones directly across the street\r\nThere\'s also a Landau jewelry shop and a gift shop...but you can buy cheap drinks for your room at the many halal carts and nearby convenience stores. \r\nOnce again as i have complained at all my hilton stays...hilton honors members should be able to get free wifi sheesh!!\r\nOh and for summer visits this grandiose hotel has no pool!\r\nDespite the price i will be back....at least i know what i am getting...'
3,'Very disappointed, only plus is location','As a business traveler who is not new to NYC, I know what comes with travel in the city, and my expectations have been more than met at other hotels in the city, but NOT at the Hilton.\r\nI think the hotel tries to handle more than it is capable of (as far as conventions go). Even with the elevators grouped by floor, a 10 minute wait was the norm for me. In the set of three elevators that stops at the 26th floor, one was out-of-service my entire time at the property. This is unacceptable at such a large hotel hosting multiple conferences at the same time. The doors would routinely open on the way down with no room for me. I found myself climbing stairs to the 34th floor to use that set of elevators multiple times.\r\nThe Hilton Club representatives stationed in the main lobby make it feel more like a time-share property that some time-share hotels I have stayed at; constantly badgering you to stop for your free gift. This was a business trip, I\'m not interested in their specials.\r\nThe rooms are dated. I expect any major NYC property to have flat screen televisions and ergonomic work-stations; this did not.\r\nOn the plus side, the location is hard to beat. Minutes from Times Square, Central Park, MoMA, etc.. \r\nI just expect more from a hotel like this.'
2,'Not a fan before, and even less of a fan now!','I\'ll preface this review by saying I have never been a fan of this hotel and only stayed because the event I was attending in NYC had a complimentary room block. Suffice it to say, I won\'t even accept a complimentary room here again. \r\nMy previous problems largely were due to the sheer size and inability of the hotel (particularly the elevators) to accommodate the numbers of guests and/or convention visitors. My complaints now encompass much more. \r\nUpon entering my first (of three) guest rooms, I could not believe I was in a Hilton versus a 1-star motel on the outskirts of town. I was given a non-renovated room which had carpet so dirty it turned my white socks black. The window curtains were stained. The walls were chipped as was the furniture. The stopper in the tub was pulled out with its rubber tubing attached and a puddle of yellow water in the tub. One of the light fixtures in the bathroom was missing its housing so the bulbs and wires were completely exposed. A call to the front desk informed me that none of the upgraded (deluxe) rooms were available that night so the soonest they could move me would be the following day, but maintenance would come take care of the other issues. The tub was fixed, but there were no replacement housing for the light fixture so it would stay. \r\nI switched rooms the following morning and the difference was as great as night and day. The room felt like a Hilton in an upscale business hotel - everything about it was 10x better. So the problem arose when I do my routine mattress inspection. I have been bitten by bedbugs before at an upscale hotel and it was not a pleasant experience so I am quite OCD about this. And sure enough, along the seams of one of the mattresses is a live bed bug, which I catch, and call the front desk to let them know. They immediately send security up to my room and the fellow could not have been friendlier, but I think part of it was that I actually had the little bugger so there was no denying it was there (at one point it felt like they tried to pin it on me for bringing the bedbug in the room, but as a frequent traveler who understand how to protect their belongings - I know I did not). So upon entering the room that the front desk manager had him move me to, he takes one look at me after smelling the stench of smoke and knows it is not acceptable. Beyond the obvious smoker who previously stayed, it was one of the older rooms again. At this point I was beyond angry, to downgrade me back to a basic room after finding a bedbug in the upgraded room was dumbfounding. The front desk manager informed me that all deluxe rooms were again full and there was nothing she could do. I told her thanks, but I would be checking out at this time. She finally offered to put me in a king room on the executive floor and give me access to the executive lounge the remainder of the stay. So that I would not have to leave hotels at 11pm, I agreed so long as the room was clean. Again though, this was an older room (why the executive rooms were not the first to be renovated is beyond me). So I entered my fourth room, thoroughly inspected it and agreed to stay. Suffice it to stay, I did not get under the sheets and barely slept the remaining two nights. \r\nAt checkout, when asked how my stay was, I decided to be honest instead of delivering the obligatory - Fine. The front desk agent was incredibly friendly and could not believe I had not been offered compensation beyond the pseudo-upgraded room and executive lounge access so she promised me that somebody would be in touch about additional compensation. I did receive a friendly e-mail from one of the assistant managers apologizing again and offering me a sizable number of HHonors points. \r\nAt the end of the day I was hesitant to write such a critical review because I believe that eventually the customer service really tried to compensate me for the problems, but in 7+ years of extensive business travel I have never had such an awful experience, been in such an out-of-date and dirty room at an upscale business hotel or switched rooms more than once so I felt compelled to share. I believe my experience probably was one of the extreme\'s, but it happened and as I said before I had never been a big fan of this hotel during previous stays. \r\nOn the plus side, the location is excellent being steps from Rockefeller Center and blocks from Central Park. The Halal Guys food cart right across the street is deserving of the long lines and worth a try.\r\nSo I may try a different Hilton property next time in NYC, but can\'t say I would return here.'
4,'Good Hotel but be Prepared for a Large City Hotel','I have stayed at the Hilton NY a few times for work and it is perfectly fine in terms of location, cleanliness and safety. The staff are friendly and professional. I have sometimes had a newly renovated room and they are excellent. The other rooms are also fine. However, the hotel is large and it is very busy. You often have to wait at peaks times for up for 5 minutes or more for an elevator. Also, this time around, despite staying 5 nights, I was allocated a tiny, tiny room right near the maids room and their 4 or 5 trolleys were parked either side of the door to my room. My only other gripe is that you have to pay $3.50 per bag to store your luggage and you have to line up for the privelege. The charges are outrageous - how many other hotels do this? Not many, I think. Can you please change this?'
3,'OK if you\'re after average','I stay here for work travel and I\'ve reviewed the hotel before. I had to write another as I was unfortunate enough to be here recently when the power went out in the whole hotel all afternoon and into the night because of an explosion with the transformer. There was chaos and lines of people trying to get information, which was not forthcoming. One Hilton staffer even yelled at me when I asked for an update! We waited for an hour in the service line to be told that they would not shift us (even though we were Diamond members) even though they were moving arriving guests. I then arranged another hotel myself and had to travel up the goods lift at the Hilton to collect my belongings. In the lift, I discovered that other guests were being moved - the inconsistent treatment of guests was very annoying! I have to say though that the next day I came back to the Hilton to check out and the service then was outstanding - they removed the prior night from my bill and were very friendly.'
4,'Good Business Hotel - Average Overall.','Hotel is a clear convention hotel. Spent a week in this hotel during a conference. Pretty much a typical Hilton hotel: everything you need and more, pricey, crowded but upgrades if you are hhonors. \r\nWould stay here again for convention and because I\'m Hilton Honors diamond.\r\nBut hotel is starting to age and I think they can do better. So just Average-Good.'
4,'Good Corporate Hotel','Stayed at the hilton new york once more for a marketing conference. It\'s a good corporate hotel with corporate amenities. We stayed with 4 guys in one room and asked for the room to be cleaned twice a day. This was no problem. Friendly staff as always. Hallways are noisy, but that\'s to be expected in a hotel of this size. As a Hilton Diamond member I was a little disappointed that every time I stay at this hotel there\'s no upgrade available. Decided to stay a few nights extra, and we got the same rate as the **discounted** corporate convention rate. That was appreciated. Would recommend the hotel to add a few extra people at the reception area. Lines are always long.'
3,'OK, but not the best.','The hotel lies in a quiet area of New York, but other wise central. It is close to Central Park and Times Square (you can walk). The hotel looks nice, but it is quite old. I would stay there again, but for the location, not for it\'s looks.'
4,'Outdated, but good location','We stayed at the hotel again during our New York visit 2012. We stayed here again because of the great location! You feel very safe in this area of NY City, and it\'s very close to Times Square and Central Park. You can also go to the Empire State Buildning from there, but it\'s kind of a long walk. The rooms are old, but clean. The lobby area is very nice, and the staff is friendly. The restaurante on the hotel has good breakfast, but if you are on a budget, I would consider rather go to Starbucks to by some bagels! Starbucks is located many places around the hotel, but you can walk through the hotel and right into Starbucks. The WiFi is also kind of expensive, but there are free WiFi in the lobby if you won\'t pay 10-15 dollars for 24 hours. Also I would like to add that our room was in the 28th floor, so we got an amazing view, AGAIN! But the TV channels did not have a signal, so we could not watch TV. But in NY City there are so many other things to do instead of watching TV!'
5,'Second time at the Hilton. Still my favorite in NYC','We were going to stay at another hotel because I had gotten a great rate. However, our trip changed suddenly and we ended up getting an even better rate at the Hilton for 9 nights. We are also Hilton Honors members. We took the breakfast and room rate and got two connecting rooms on the 13th floor. If you have a big family ask for these rooms - we had 2 double beds in one room and a king with a sofa in the other for $249 which is really good for NYC. The rooms were big and the housekeepers really nice and very clean. The location of the Hilton can\'t be beat. I personally would not stay in Times Square with my children because it\'s so busy. Around the Hilton you have alot of restaurants to sit down without struggling with a crowd and it\'s close to Central Park and the nicest stores of 5th Avenue. We also walked to times Square every day and our broadway show we saw near Times Square. We took our laundry to a wash and fold everyday which is only a block from the hotel. The breakfast buffet is great with pancakes/french toast, eggs, fresh fruit, Japanese, smoked salmon and cheese, bagels and cream cheese, mushrooms, sausage. We also ordered room service many times. One big advantage to the Hilton is the covered area for taxis to come and pick you up. It stormed and rained the whole week and this covered valet helped alot. We\'ll probably always stay at the Hilton when we come to New York.'
2,'Unfortunate stay','Reservaion made on booking.com for 5 nights for a one bedroom suite for e nordhausen. Initially was a problem because my passport says nordhausen. Couldn\'t believe that. Room was on 43rd floor. Black ac and heating vents, carpet sticky, sofa bed not sleepable and had dirty sheets, had to put a towel underneath door because too noisy from air whipping through halls. Thank goodness i brought two comforters for the couch to make a bed for my daughter. We also booked a towncar for the airport via the concierge and it didn\'t show up. Beds uncomfortable. Housekeeping kept putting my toothbrushes back in bathroom even though i keep them out. Why? Guess it bothered her. Room service was fine and waiters nice even though they were busy. A bit pricey though. Internet doesn\'t work unless you order premium at $18 and for each device. All this experience for 529/night. If i hadn\'t have booked a nonrefundable rate i would have been outta there.'
2,'Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis stimmt nicht','Das Zimmer war nicht sauber und das Personal, speziell an der Rezeption war nicht freundlich. Rechnungsadresse musste wegen einem Fehler korrigiert werden, was auch nach vierfachem Versuch und langer Wartezeit nicht geklappt hat. Ich habe es dann manuell gemacht. Beim nächsten Besuch in New York werde ich wieder im Hilton Times Square übernachten, welches vom Standard her besser ist.'
3,'Teilweise geht\'s zu wie auf einem Bahnhof','Habe mich wieder mal für dieses Hilton überreden lassen, was aber nicht der beste Enscheid war. Einzig die Lage ist gut, aber sonst eher eine Massenabfertigung. Schon bei der Ankunft musste ich in einer Schlange von Leuten anstehen um dann in ein nicht gerade sauberes Zi. zu kommen. Im Zi. gab es als HHonors Member kein Wasser, keine Hausschuhe und es war wirklich schmutzig. Im Bad hatte es keinen Schminkspiegel, was meine Frau stören würde. Es gab auch in meinem Zi. keine Kaffeemaschine, wie ich es von anderen Hilton gewohnt bin. Grundsätzlich ist das Hotel sehr unpersönlich und auf allen Fluren lag stundenlang schmutzige Wäsche und auch sonst waren die Flure schmuddelig. Nächste Mal gehe ich wieder in das Hilton Times Square, wo ich mich wohler fühle.'
4,'We will use this hotel again','Good hotel, conveniently located Midtown Manhattan. The common areas are impressively large (good also to stroll around your kids if needed ...) -- only defect of the hall: some more seats would be useful! The room are also quite large for being in New York. The beds are pretty comfortable. Good ratio quality/price.'
4,'This time I did not sleep at the hilton (I did many times but now I live in NYC) but I want to rate review it coffee bar: noisy,','I go quite often at the Hilton. I used to sleep here when I did not live in NYC. It\'s a very clean and comfortable hotel. I reviewed it before. Now I live in NYC and I quite often go there for lunch (good). Last week for the first time I tried its coffee bar. It was quite unsatisfactory. The place is incredibly noisy. We ordered two slices of cake (average), a cup of coffee (nothing great) and a bottle of water. But listen to this: while I was writing on my computer, the waiter took away my bottle of water. I called him back and kindly I said inadvtently you took away my Perrier.\r\ni was still drinking. insteda of saying sorry, he want away mumbling. He came back with a half bottle ofwater (mine) and another one full. He put in front of me with a ok, now?. Giving a new bottle for free was nice but rudeness , as a famous commercial goes, is priceless! I don\'t think I will go again in that place'
5,'Amazing Hilton with an amazing representative...','I travel a lot and have stayed at Hilton hotels in many different places, and don\'t usually write reviews like this. But, the quality of service we\'ve received during our stay at the 6th Avenue Hilton has been so incredible I had to share. The representative we booked with was Yara Samad--by far the NICEST, most polite and knowledgeable rep I\'ve ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Yara fully informed us of the benefits of staying in the Hilton and made us aware of the quality of service here. She took us through the hotel and showed us the various types of rooms, and even after we had booked, remained in contact with us to keep us updated on our reservation. Thank you so much, Yara! Our stay at the Hilton was outstanding because of your hard work! We look forward to booking with you next year!'

4,'Most recent stay was better than the last few','I\'ve stayed at this hotel numerous times over the past ten years with mixed results over time. When I first started staying here, it was hands down one of my favorite hotels, and not just in NYC. Over the past few years I\'ve experienced some substandard rooms that were poorly located, less than cordial staff, and an overall experience that resulted in my selecting other hotels off and on. \r\nI will admit that my choosing the Hilton for this trip was so I could stay at the same hotel as my traveling colleague. This time the check in staff person was extremely pleasant and accommodating. We got nicer rooms than my last few visits. The rooms are still basic but nice enough for NY. The fitness center is what really made my stay this time though -thoroughly enjoyed it and front desk staff was most pleasant at six a.m. This stay was a good one and given the fitness center, definitely planning to keep staying on future trips.'
4,'After what seems to have been a temporary dip in quality, the Hilton is again providing the experience I like to expect.','This is not my first review of this hotel. The woman at the registration desk this time was very friendly and helpful. I also go a really nice room this time. Hotel definitely has some rooms that are nicer than others. Room is clean and attractive. Looking forward to using the gym in the mornings. This is the second trip in a row that this hotel is really earning my respect back. It may actually become my hotel of choice again.'
4,'Amazing Location','I stay at this hotel for a month every September for business. The rooms are clean and spacious. My only complaint is the fact the the fridge is miniscule and filled with mini bar items. I am staying here for a month and have no where to cool off my personal items. In addition I wish they allowed us to have microwaves in our rooms as eating out for a month gets really old really fast. But the pluses of this hotel are its close proxemity to central park, broadway and times square.'
5,'Impeccable Service','I was here on business again and they really took care of me. I had a great corner room. The housekeeping staff was so friendly and helpful. I arrived in my room and realized that they have gotten rid of all of there fridges in the hotel. I was going to be here for 3 weeks and needed one. I am a diamond member so I called down to the front and they accomidated me :-) This hotel is so central to everything and our go to place when we are in the city.'
1,'Worst NYC HH property/AWFUL treatment of Hilton Diamonds','I go to NYC at least 5 times a year and have stayed at various Hilton properties and this is the worst Hilton Property I have ever stayed at in NYC (the other ones are great) and possibly the worst full service Hilton I have ever stayed at. In the future I will go back to staying at the Hilton Fashion District, the HGI on 8th or in Chelsea or the Doubletree on Broadway which are all better properties.\r\nThe main reason I chose this property was it was the only Hilton in NYC with an exec lounge. The lounge was a joke. There were a couple big families and several people in there that weren\'t even staying in the hotel Hiltons policy is that the lounge is reserved for people on the exec floors and diamonds who can bring one guest staying in their room and this wasn\'t enforced. I would rather skip this lounge and stay at one of the other properties that has a decent hot breakfast.\r\nEverytime I stay at the Hilton fashion district (or any other hilton for that matter) I am always given 2 bottles of water at check in or vouchers for 2 free bottles out of the mini bar or in the room if they have them in the room. No water. Hilton diamonds are suppose to get suites as part of the new benefits introduced earlier this year if available, but was not upgraded even though suites were available to be booked when I tried doing a dummy reservation once I got to my room.\r\nNo coffee makers in the room. Aside from the former LV Hilton, this is the only full service Hilton I have stayed at without coffee makers in the room. Hiltons T&C state that HH members who are silver and higher are to receive complimentary fitness center access. I was told the fee was $15!!!!! What hotel charges their top tier loyalty members $15 per VISIT to use the hotel fitness center????\r\nAnd I found out after I checked out that this property opts out of most quarterly hilton promos, so I didn\'t even get the bonus points.\r\nIf you are a Hilton diamond member (or even a blue who wants good service), stay at the Hilton Fashion District or one of the other HH properties in the city. Every HH property I have stayed at in Manhattan I have always given a 4 or 5 star review.'
4,'Always stay here when in NY','Location, standard of rooms and general standard of rooms are all great. The executive lounge is a perfect bonus when I can have access. For business it makes the perfect location for both up town and down town.'
4,'Another wonderful stay','I stay in this hotel 2-3 times a year and because of its great location its a must stay if the rate is right. \r\nI was able to use the Executive Lounge which was not as crowded as usual this time.\r\nI will return.'
4,'3rd visit in 2012','This was my third visit in 2012. The location is key and one of the best in the CIty. If you are coming from JFK take the Air Train to Jamaica then the E subway to 7th and 53rd. The hotel is 2 mins walk from the exit. For just $7.50 door to virtually the hotel its better than a $60 cab ride if you include tolls and tips. \r\nI stayed in an Executive Floor room which allowed access to the Executive Lounge. What a transformation! It has been moved from the 44th Floor to a brand new location on the main floor, This to my mind is a great pity as the views before were amazing. However the refurbishment is really good and for breakfast the extra space using the part of the lobby bar area is great. In the evening when they are serving canapes its a bit of a zoo to be honest. Too small, too many people.\r\nI will continue to stay for the location and the staff who are always friendly.'
5,'Mitten drin...','Mit dem Hilton in der 6th Ave hat man ein City-Hotel mitten drin und günstig gelegen. Wie alle großen Hotels in NYC ist auch das Hilton in gewisser Weise unpersönlich. Die Menschenmassen lassen keinen anderen Betrieb zu. Hat man ein Aniegen, wird aber prompt geholfen. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig wie in allen Hilton Hotels. Das Hotel liegt perfekt für alle Aktivitäten, nahe an U-Bahn und Bus. Kurze Wege zur 5th Ave, zum Central Park oder zum Times Square. Ein Markt-Restaurant bietet auch Verpflegung im Haus.'
4,'Unsere erste Wahl für NYC','Vom Hilton in der Avenue oft he Americas sind wir seit unserem ersten Aufenthalt vor einigen Jahren überzeugt. Es liegt prima, und entspricht dem, was man erwartet. Einziges Manko ist die extra Berechnung für die Internet-Nutzung. Das sollte in der heutigen Zeit und bei den aufgerufenen Zimmerpreisen einfach enthalten sein. Schade ist, dass das „normale Restaurant im Erdgeschoss nicht immer geöffnet hat.\r\nTrotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte werden wir beim nächsten Aufenthalt in NYC wohl wieder im Hilton landen.'
5,'Great hotel; Awesome location','From the moment we arrived the service was excellent. Check-in took only minutes and the hotel staff members were helpful and polite. The hotel lobby is spacious and beautiful. Our rooms were beautifully decorated and perfectly clean. The hotel was very quiet and the beds were comfortable. There is no better location in the city. Everything is within walking distance...Times Square, theaters, 30Rock, Central Park and shopping. The breakfast buffet was great especially for our kids. We will defintely stay at this hotel on our next trip.'
5,'Top notch in every way','This was our third stay at this great hotel. We wouldn\'t stay anywhere else. The staff is great from the moment you check in. The rooms are always exceptionally clean and the beds are very comfortable. Room service is excellent. The location of this hotel is the best in the city. It\'s a short walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue, and Times Square. We will continue to chooseThe Hilton when we travel to New York City.'
3,'Serviço impessoal, rude','As instalações são razoáveis, mas o serviço é ruim. A recepção é grosseira, beiram à estupidez, deixam claro que crianças não são bem vindas. \r\nO restaurante cobra caro por uma comida mal feita. Eu pagaria esse valor e ficaria feliz em fazê-lo se os alimentos tivessem sabor e demonstrassem o frescor necessário a uma comida saudável.\r\nQuando há varios hotéis de instalações semelhantes, deveria haver a preocupação com o serviço para se tornarem especiais.'
5,'Esta muito melhor!','Em 2010 publiquei uma avaliação, onde dizia impessoal, rude. Estive novamente no Hilton NY em dez/jan-2011/2012 e deixo aqui minha mais agradável surpresa. Serviço foi impecável, gentil, atento. Quarto limpo, reposição de frigobar e amenities a tempo e hora, internet funcionou muito bem. Qdo chegamos para o check in, o sistema do hotel havia caído e foi nesse momento em que pude comprovar a mudança: imediatamente colocaram um aviso informando o problema, tempo estimado para restabelecimento, e desculpas pelo ocorrido. Ao mesmo tempo, outra pessoa da equipe distribuía água mineral para quem estava na fila e oferecia uma alternativa para deixarmos as malas guardadas no hotel e aproveitar o tempo de espera para ir ao restaurante ou fazer um passeio. A questão é que problemas técnicos ocorrem, a diferença esta no tratamento que se da aos clientes diante desses imprevistos, e acreditem, Hilton teve uma atitude absolutamente irretocável. Parabéns, fico feliz em me manter como cliente desse Hotel.'
5,'Comfortable hotel in a great location!','Two friends and I stayed at the Hilton New York on 11/12-13. We arrived at the hotel around 11am, several hours before check-in. The hotel allowed us to leave our bags there, and gave us coupon so we would not be charged to leave our luggage. I\'ve been to NYC several times and stayed at numerous hotels, and this is the first time I wasn\'t charged to check my luggage.\r\nThe location is absolutely excellent. The following locations are no more than roughly 3-4 blocks away: Time Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and Central Park. There are also several subway stops close by, and taxis were never hard to get.\r\nWe stayed in a non-smoking room with two queen beds. The room wasn\'t huge, but we also had plenty of space. In addition to the beds and nightstand, there was an armchair, desk and chair, and closet. The bathroom was decently sized as well.\r\nRegarding service, we never had an issue. One friend became ill and stayed in the room all day, and we left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Housekeeping called that afternoon to double-check if we needed our room cleaned. At another point, we called Housekeeping for more towels. They were delivered quickly, and we received a follow-up call to ensure that the towels were delivered.\r\nBecause our trip was booked on Priceline, I can\'t say for sure if it\'s a good value off the regular booking price. But if you can get a great deal, I definitely recommend staying here for the location alone.'
5,'Second stay was even better!','I stayed here back in November and had an excellent stay. So when my mother, future mother-in-law, future sister-in-law, and I wanted to visit NYC, Hilton New York was my first choice hotel. We booked our stay and our airfare through Travelocity.\r\nWe arrived very early in the morning, hours before check-in, and the staff let us store our luggage at no charge while we explored the city. We did have to pay $3 per bag on the day we checked out, but that was a very reasonable price.\r\nI used the concierge a couple of times for directions, and they were very helpful every time. When I asked for the best route to Ground Zero, they handed me a print off with directions there and back. Very helpful!\r\nThe rooms are average size and very nice. We stayed in a room with two queen beds, and it also had a desk, armchair, and two end tables. The bathroom was also average sized.\r\nProbably the best thing about this particular hotel is its proximity to everything. Within walking distance are: Time Square, Central Park, Rockefeller, New York Public Library, and many subway stations. \r\nI highly recommend this hotel, and will probably stay there again in the future!'
5,'wonderful hotel','What a wonderful hotel! Beautiful, great location and extremely superior staff! Walking to shopping, restaurants, and the theater! Will do over and over again!'
3,'For single travellers only','Plus points:\r\nLocation, location, location - wide street, with little through traffic, an easy walk to Barneys, Bloomies, Saks etc.\r\nProximity to Time Warner mall - great Wholefoods Market in the basement for in-room picnics.\r\nCool public spaces - Kinda bizarre to feel like you are walking into a nightclub when you are coming back dog-tired and loaded down with shopping bags and a Starbucks, but it\'s fun and different.\r\nRoom decor - Loved the wood panelling, sheer curtains and the white/chrome clinical bathroom. Bed/pillows v comfy.\r\nMinus points:\r\nTiny tiny room, even by New York standards - Tolerable if you are travelling alone, but I would have felt seriously claustrophobic if there with anyone else.\r\nBar in the atrium - light sleepers would hate the background noise from the bar in the evenings, and I was on a high floor.\r\nDated technology - TV is just an ancient portable, music system takes cassettes, not Ipod.\r\nSummary: Fun experience, but not somewhere I\'d stay regularly.'
3,'Zentale Lage bei der Pennstation','Wer zwischen Ankunft mit dem Flieger und der Weiter reise Per Zug der Amtrak ein Zentrale Übernachtung Sucht ist hier richtig. Denn dasHotel liegt Direckt vis a vis der der Pennstation und dem Madison Sqare Garden. der Time Sqare , Brodway und das Epiere State Buiding ist in Fuss Distanz. da das Hole sehr gross ist entstehen manchmal Schlangen an der Rezeption.'
5,'Awesome Location!','Out tour group arrived for a six night stay. The rooms were pretty spacious and clean! We were concern with the the recent bed bug infestation in NYC but are happy to report that it doesn\'t exist in this wonderful hotel. The bell men and front desk staff are so accomodating and friendly. \r\nWe love going to the theatre and this hotel makes it so easy to walk. The hotel is also very ADA accessible for wheelchair visitors. This hotel is a little pricy but worth it!'
3,'Location 5 stars.. but Old style..need upgrade','Been there as diamond member , been given a room on 40 floor.. outstanding views of Central park. Lobby and reception huge and a lot of confusion during peak hours. To get lift often you have to wait a lot. Executive Lounge with complimentary breakfast and appetizer but alcohol non included. Room quite big for NYC standards. \r\nI personally think that this hotel needs a huge upgrade . Old style.\r\nLocation is the reason to chose this hotel.'
1,'Parking garage nightmare','Upon valeting my car on our arrival day the attendant inspected the vehicle to ensure their was no damage to our car. He made it known that our car had a couple scratches on the left said. I said yes and that it was something I have done. He marked it down on paper. After our two night stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel we asked to have our car brought up to us. Let me make it known that we left it parked in the hotel garage the entire weekend we stayed in NYC. After the attendant brought up our car I noticed my right rear bumper. It had an enormous significant scratch/rub on the bumper. I instantly called over the attendant. He argued with us that he did not do it. I stated that my car was not like this prior to entering the parking garage that friday night that we arrived. He called us in the office to get a claim slip and continued to give us a hard time saying that they didn\'t do this. I told him I would call the police to file a report. We did call the police and notified the security at the hotel. I was assured by hotel security staff that if I did not get anywhere with the parking company after I filed my claim to call them back and they would help take care of it. My husband called the claim number on Monday after we returned home. The woman who answered said it would take up to five days to receive the claim and that she would call back. She did not. That Thursday my husband called again and the woman told him that our case had been closed due to the attendant at the parking garage stating that he was not responsible for the damage done to my car. He was outraged at what she had said. He told her that we had pictures that we had taken before we left the parking garage that day. She said that if we sent the pictures to her to review that they would again open the case and call us back. In the meantime I called the hotel security again to assure me that they could help me get this claim going along since the security man at the hotel took down all my information and filed a report with the hotel regarding this incident. Needless to say I was not confident in the response I received from the security man that I spoke to. I was told prior to leaving the hotel not to worry that they would take care of me and upon speaking to them today I feel as though they are giving me the run around. I am uneasy about this entire situation as I feel as though they have been playing games with me. Please, if you plan on staying at this hotel think twice regarding the parking arrangement. I have a fairly new vehicle and they did damage my car and tried to cover up the damage. I advise people to be cautious and if you do park your car here request copies of the vehicle report upon your car entering the garage. Maybe even have them sign off on it. I do not have any paperwork to cover myself at this point and may lose money on this. Perfect way to ruin a great weekend in NYC!!!!!!! BE AWARE!'
3,'mi è piaciuto e ci tornerò','Hotel d\'annata ma decentemente ristrutturato è ok per prezzo, pulizia, personale reception non molto disponibile quindi adatto per il FAI DA TE - porto di mare - gente ..tanta gente che parte ed arriva ad ogni ora adatto per riposare... dopo aver camminato tutto il giorno... anche bagnetto vecchietto ..ma in ordine..VALIDISSOMO PER POSIZIONE CENTRALISSIMA attaccato a Penn Station quindi appena fuori hotel città in mano prezzi ott\r\nimi e più bassi a marzo ed aprile ... terzo soggiorno e... ci ritornerò P.S.

5,'Diverse Appeal','The Palmer House Hilton welcomes all sorts of guests-on a cool February weekend, there is a diverse collection of guests: The Central Conference of the American Philosophical Association, Hundreds of members of a collegiate business fraternity, a very formal wedding reception, and attendees of a major collegiate basketball tournament. It\'s an excited, celebratory, diverse community of guests, and the hotel has functioned impressively.'
2,'Mi experiencia en Hotel Pennsylvania','El hotel Pennsylvania junto a Penn Station y frente al Madison Square Garden tiene en la ubicación su único punto favorable.\r\nEl resto del hotel, un monstruo de casi 2000 habitaciones, no tiene ni encanto. Pasillos enormes y mal iluminados, Habitaciones cuyo mobiliario data de varias decadas pasadas, servicio de recepción extremadamente deficiente, nefasto funcionamiento del aire acondicionado, etc.\r\nSolo queda por destacar que, al menos, su servicio técnico es eficiente y tardo poco en arreglar la avería que tuvimos en el WC.\r\nAunque el precio sea econónimo, no recomendaria alojarse en este hotel si va a visitar NYC!'
4,'Excellent Location, Great Accommodations','Family of 4 stayed at Hilton NY near 53rd and 6th in Midtown Manhattan.\r\nPros: located almost right in between Central Park and Times Square. Easily accessible to Columbus Circle, Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie Hall and Radio City Music Hall. Hotel was clean and had a great view on 33rd floor (ask for a renovated room when booking). Quick check-in and check-out.\r\nCons: water (tap and shower) smelled funny in room, remote didn\'t work very well (like every hotel room in America), and concierge staff provided no more insight than we could have found on a map or a restaurant guide.'

5,'Outstanding Location! Reasonable Prices! BIG Thumbs Up!','I have specifically signed up to Trip Advisor just to write the review of this hotel as I was so pleased with our say.\r\nWe originally arrived for a 4 night stay, but the day we were due to fly home, the volcano brought all flights down to the ground. Our room for the first 4 nights was quite small, but we were there for a sleeping, nothing else, and after the busy days you have in a 5 day trip, you could sleep in an elevator! The room was cosy and comfortable, but we had some very noisy girls mucking around in the corridors at 3am which was annoying, but it didn\'t effect us too much, although the constant door slamming was annoying. However we got our own back when we came back to the hotel to drop something off around midday and we could hear loud snoring coming from one room with a do not disturb sign on the door. We knew it was these girls room, so I decided to wake them up by knocking on the door. I\'m vengeful like that.\r\nAnyway, the hotel is in a superb location, and everything like empire state building, broadway, madison square garden and times square are within walking distance from the hotel lobby! The staff are helpful but a bit mute. We eventually noticed the reasons why, they work 15 hour shifts some of them, and simply aren\'t as excited about your trip as you are, but they do their job to a good standard. \r\nNow, when our flights were cancelled, we were stranded. The hotel couldnt book us in as they were fully booked. So we had to stay in a very cheap hotel not too far away for one night. We rang the hotel that night to book in for the next day, and they got us a room. We had to keep booking everyday as we didn\'t know when our flights home would be. They eventually called our room to say we need to come down first thing every mornng to rebook (we didnt want to book in block until we knew flight times and dates). They again ran out of rooms and therefore put us in a penthouse suite on the very top floor. FOR THE PRICE OF A STANDARD ROOM! We were eventually here for 2 weeks in that room until our flight out. The suites are just unbelievable, you feel like a celebrity once in there. If you have room in your budget, just stay in one for one night! It\'s about double the cost of a standard room, but so so posh! The hotel staff are easily charmed. The hotel was clean, and the staff (once charmed and slight jovial banter) were extremely friendly and helpful, especially if you show your gratitude in return. \r\nYou have things like McDonalds and Tick Tock Diner right on your doorstep, so for breakfast or a quick meal these places are great and the food at Tick Tock was Tip Top in my opinion. Road traffic outside would only affect you if you were quite low down, but like I say if your days our busy as ours were, you won\'t really notice. They have a gym downstairs for guests and students that live there. (We knew a student living there who is the daughter of a guy we work with). \r\nIn short I\'d highly recommend this hotel, we went back there for a reason when we got stranded, as the location was superb, it was clean, and quiet to an extent. We have raved about this to anyone who has gone to New York, all of them have come back with favourable reviews of the hotel. Please ignore all bad reviews, our stay here wasn\'t perfect, no stay will ever be truly perfect, but at The New Yorker, it was easily the best hotel we have stayed in in New York. (I have been to New York 4 times before this trip).\r\nEveryones experience is different though, and some people have different standards, but for the money, this truly is a superb choice in my opinion!'
4,'Decent price for a decent hotel','Just returned home after 6 nights in The Edison. The hotel was as I expected for the price. Nothing fancy just functional. The only down was the lack of any toiletries, no soap/shower gel/toothpaste. On the plus side the lobby is nicely done out in a deco style with 20s/30\'s music being played.\r\nThe hotel is in a fantastic spot. turn right leaving and your slap bang in Times Square, left and your in Hells Kitchen which I thought was fantastic. So many small family run restaurants. \r\nI avoided breakfast there as Dannys next door offered much cheaper (and very filling food)'
1,'stay away from this hotel','I have had the unfortunate pleasure of staying at this hotel a few times (booked by my office not by me). Put it like this, I will never be stepping foot in this dump ever again. From the moment you walk into the lobby you would think ok this place looks nice. This is where the deception begins. The lobby is filled with people and I only discovered why after I got to my room. There is no WIFI or cable connection in the rooms for internet. In this day and age a hotel that does not have this basic feature isn\'t off to a good start in my books. The only WIFI available is in the lobby and it\'s not free. There is always a HUGE queue at checkin and only about 2-3 people behind the counter. They offer no apology for the wait and the woman I had took a phone call on her mobile just as I got to the counter after waiting 30mins. When I got to the room it was horrible. There is paint flaking off everywhere, mould throughout and cockroaches in the bath tub. This hotel would be more beneficial if it was torn down and the only good point I had is the location. I have warned everyone I know about this place. Rude unhelpful staff, long waiting times at checkin and dirty run down rooms and corridors.'
4,'Great Hotel - Great Location','The location of the Westin at Times Square is fantastic - walking distance to many major NYC attractions includinig the theaters, Bryant Park,Central Park, etc. The room was large, even by New York standards, and very clean. The bed was awesome and the room on the 41st floor was very quiet. I also would rate the concierge service very high - arranging same day theater tickest and dinner reservations. Overall, a great hotel. Again, the location is the best, room was large and clean, however the hotel does not offer much in the way of dining or bar...a chain steak house that never appeared to be very busy..or even open.'
4,'Great Hotel','Stayed here Jan 11th to Jan 14th 08, fantastic place to stay, only 10min walk from Times Square. Recommend room 1821, it was a huge corner room overlooking the Empire State building. Had it not been for the abrubt reception staff and a unhelpful concierge this would have been 5 star.'
4,'Good Location can be a bad thing','Rooms are very big in NYC standards, hotel is nice, upscale feel, rooms are fresh and renovated.\r\nLuggage assistance is non-existant if your taxi stops on broadway. The bell boy that came to assist us with our heavy luggage just pointed the direction into the hotel and nothing else - disgusting, 5 star treatment .... yeah right!\r\nLocation is considered to be perfect since the hotel is in the heart of times square but after a day or two you start to get irritated due to the touristic feel of the area. Tons of people marching the streets right when you exit the hotel and lots of agents offering tourist traps are spread EVERYWHERE. Location is nice in theory but I prefer to see the city life and not tourist attractions on offer whenever I leave the hotel. Next time I would stay elsewhere in midtown. For example: the new york Helmsley is well located on 42nd and Lexington ave.'
1,'NYC Grant Hyatt needs a major make-over','The location of the hotel is great; it is at the center of everything. Location is perfect and I am perfectly happy with that. \r\nHowever, I can only use the word lousy to describe the room and the overall environment. The whole property needs some work. The place is old.\r\nHere are the things that hotel management needs to work on:\r\n•The most important issue to me is security. There is no one to check your keys before you enter the elevators; so basically, anyone can go to the floors, except for the Club floor, which requires a special key to enter. One day, I actually found take out menus under the doors. Someone was dropping off menus in side the hotel. This is too crazy. You would think that management would take guest security seriously given the fact that the property is right next to the Grant Central Station and near the Met Life building. \r\n•The hot water is not hot enough. \r\n•Drain is very slow. \r\n•Paint is falling from the bath room ceiling. \r\n•Hallway carpet is very run down. \r\n•The room is generally clean but the corners are very dusty. \r\n•Hotel Staff (other than the front desk) expects you to tip them for everything, if not you might get a dirty look.\r\nOverall, my experience was not pleasant and this is definitely not the hotel I will stay during my vacation.'
4,'Grand old Dame does the trick!!','I stayed at the Pennsylvania 20 & 21 October en route to the Caribbean from Australia, and again overnight on way back.I wanted to have a look at New York city!\r\nThis hotel reminds me of a grand old dame! Look it is a wonderful old hotel of the Big Band era, and I loved the architecture, lobby etc.\r\nThe staff were helpful and the rooms although they are not flash and are a bit tired (carpets\r\nand bathroom in particular) .... the bed was big and comfortable, the room was very clean and had a TV and the shower was hot and worked beautifully!\r\nThe location is perfect and you can walk to Broadway Theatres in a 12 minute stroll!\r\nIf you are looking for big flash rooms then you are going to pay big dollars! Cost here was perfect! By the way great food at the Carnegie deli on 7th Ave near 55th street. Loved their Red Velvet cake ... delicious!!! but the sandwiches are far too big 6 inches high!'
3,'Not bad','This hotel is not that bad. the rooms are not the most stylish as they are made for holiday makers that just get drunk and have kids charging around the rooms. The location is 10/10 the cost is also 10/10 but the actual rooms themselves are 6/10'
4,'Great location','Loved this property and loved the location. Great central place to see things. Located near subway so this place was great. Higher floors have great views of harbor.'
4,'Excellent Hotel - Superb Location','Stayed there with my other half for 5 nights late May early June 2009. Hotel is 5 minute walk to Empire State and 10 mins to Time Square. Rooms are very clean , bit small but you only need somewhere to lie down ! Bar is good , a bit pricey but not bad for a beer after all the shopping. Staff are good , but tip ;-) Location is brilliant for seeing the main areas of New York. Hint : use the Subway Penn 34th is right beside Hotel and we saw all of New York and were always able to get the subway back to Hotel. Saves all the hassle. Overall rating for us 8.5 out of 10. Would defo go back and will !! Food is OK in Tick Tock Diner , did not try Coopers Tavern. Plenty of spots around to eat though.'
2,'OK, BAD ATTENTION','I made a booking and when I get there nobody had any idea about my reservation. And I tried to talk with the manager Mr. Kavral but he didn\'t want to talk, what a bad professional this hotel is hiring!! , I don\'t recommend this hotel'
3,'Quick Overnight Stay','I stayed here for one night during an unexpected flight delay. The room rate was $399 (almost $470 with all of the crazy New York taxes) for a basic rack room. I was not very impressed with the place. For some reason, the lobby is on the 8th floor. My room was on the 10th floor and there was construction going on there. Room was very basic with few amenities. There was no honor bar – which is a major pet peeve of mine. There was a coffee maker. However, it only made one cup at a time and only paper cups were provided. The bathroom had basic amenities (shampoo, conditioner, no mouth wash). I used the executive room for breakfast. It was extremely small for such a large hotel. Upon check-out, I had to wait a little over an hour for a taxi back to the airport.'
4,'Much better than last time','Unlike my last stay (see earlier negative review), this one was much better because: (1) there was a reading lamp next to the chair in the room; (2) there was a new flat panel TV screen in the room, although the movie system didn\'t have the clearest picture...kind of \'fuzzy\'; (3) the room was very clean/the housekeeping staff was friendly; and (3) aided perhaps by the self-check-in kiosks, the check-in experience was fast and friendly. The lobby is still an anthill (owing to great central location), but they\'ve organized the people flow better and I appreciated the complimentary coffee coupons. The only discordant notes this time around? The stiff pricing of the room service menu, especially in the context of the sometimes long hold times in getting through to room service on the phone (but the operators were always very friendly).'
4,'Nice Weekend at The Palmer Hosue','My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton July 14-17, 2005 and had a nice time. Check-in process was quick and efficient. As far as our room accommodations, the first room that we had was very small. After discussion with the front desk, our second room was much better. We opted for a queen room which had plenty room but we gave up the bigger bathroom that our first room had because of the room size. That was our only complaint! Valet service was great and knowledgeable for directions on the quickest route to Wrigley Field. We would definitely stay at the Palmer House Hilton again.'
1,'Not a happy experience','Stayed for four nights in March. 25 minute queue to book in while staff chatted behind the counter and seemed not to notice guests. Areas of the hotel very gloomy. Bedrooms so small that the wall-hung television could caused bruising. Not something I would repeat voluntarily.'
2,'Location was good, but was in poor condition, tv broken, internet stupid.','I liked being right across from Madison Square Garden, down the street from Times Square, a mile from Central Park, a few blocks from Empire State Building (made it convenient to hit many NY landmarks) but the paint was peeling off the walls, room had minimal amenities for the price, the television was non-functional (was actually burned), the internet was NOT free AND you couldn\'t access it from your room!! (only the lobby) and the Business Center was 20 cents a minute (a dollar only buys you five minutes!). The view of the room we had sucked (the wall of the next building).'
5,'I loved my room and the bed was so comfortable','It was in the heart of everything and everywhere I wanted to go. The location was great and the service was impeccable. I decided to extend my stay an extra night and the gave me a special deal.'
4,'Clean, Central and Affordable','My sister and I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights on our big adventure to New York. The room we had was spacious and clean. It could have done with a revamp - but hey - we were in New York and it was a great place as it was central to everthing. We walked everywhere from here - even to Central Park - a two hour stroll. The staff were helpful and we would definitely go back. In fact we will!!'
4,'Wonderful anniversary Trip!','this was our first visit to New York, we were very nervous as to what to expect - we need not have worried. we stayed for 5 days. We had a studio room. The bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate. The addition of the kitchenette was helpful although not essential as everything you could possible need ,food and drink wise, was within easy walking distance. The bed was incredible comfortabe and we had a great view from the 19th floor. The location of the hotel is certainly one of its best selling points. Times Square is only 15 mins away - not too close for the noise! 5th and 6th avenue minutes away, Maceys on your doorstep. If i had to make any critism of this hotel - the corridors to the rooms are looking a bit worn and dowdy - they could do with a bit of brightening up.I must add a great thanks to Maureen on the conciege desk, she recommended the Blue Fin restaurant to us for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner - she also booked it for us. She made sure we had a great table and that the staff new of our special occasion - it turned out to be a wonderful night. Would we stay there again - absolutely.'
4,'No problems!!','I stayed for 6 nights with my sister, we were a little concerned about the room size after reading the reviews on here, but really the room was fine - yes it was very small, but clean and warm. We didn\'t visit NY to stay in the bedroom - so the size of TV and bathroom not an issue!\r\nThe location is great - 2 minutes walk to central park, 10 minutes to Broadway/Time Square, about 15 minutes to Bloomingdales.\r\nThere is also a subway station about 2 minutes walk away too (enter under the Time Warner building)\r\nThe aircon is a bit loud - but having read this before we left we took earplugs - so no probs here either. Bar was also loud but couldn\'t hear at all in our room on the 5th floor.\r\nAll staff were friendly & helpful - woudl stay again.'
4,'Loved it','We loved this hotel. Fantastic location, almost opposite Madison Square Garden, only a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, and a short walk up 7th Avenue to Times Square. We had a studio room. The room itself was huge! Big king size bed, writing desk, table and chairs and a dresser. The kitchen was great too. The only thing I would criticise would be the bathroom which was tiny. But if you thought the bathroom was tiny, the shower was even smaller. I\'ve never seen anything like it. I couldn\'t wash my hair without my elbows touching the walls! And I\'m not a big person! It was small! But the water pressure was great, so that kind of made up for it! Other than that, this hotel is great. Oh and it has a great bar for a few drinks too!!'
3,'Almost overwhelming','1 night stay at Marriott Marquis - was actually trying it to decide if I wanted to bring family here next summer. I am still on the fence. I am a rewards member and find Marriotts to be consistent and one of my preferred brrands. The Marquis is just average. Frankly - for a family its got everything you need - but its just too big. The elevators have to be keyed into your floor and then they tell you which elevator to wait for - I was on the 34th floor in a large corner king suite - great view and great space - but this hotel is like a mini city itself - that dumps out into the extremely busy Times Square - I like my travel to be a little more low key and intimate. The staff were quite friendly and accomodating - but it is a little unnerving that the trunks of all cars and cabs are inspected as you pull up - of course you are reminded of the terror strikes at Marriotts at other parts of the world and are comforted knowing Marriott takes safety seriously, but it really emphasizes the size of this facility. I ate at the View restaraunt at the top, that rotates around for a full view of the city - not only was the environment lovely, the meal was better than I expected for a fixed priced 3 course menu. I liked the many amenities here, including an incredible fitness center, bars restaurants, Starbucks, you name it . . but if you are looking for more personal experience, quiet and ease of travel - look at a smaller hotel off of Times Square.'
5,'Great pre-theatre dinner and wonderful server - Tony','What a wonderful surprise that the hotel restaurant would have a fabulously prepared pre-theatre menu selection and outstanding service. Not only had the waiter seen the Broadway shows we were going to see, he offered some great insight too! Check this out - Tony even reminded me that the gratuity was already added into the bill when delivering the check!! Wow. You just can\'t beat that! The hotel staff made it so easy to store our luggage before check in time, and after check out time the next day! Hurray for a wonderful NYC weekend!!!'
3,'Great location, decent rooms....','OK, it isnt the newest or nicest place around, but how often are you in your room when you are visiting new york? If you arare anything like me, you go there only to sleep or put your feet up. There is no view, the rooms are dark -- but the value for the money is great.'
2,'Not Bad','The hotel is in a brilliant location. On arrival it appears pretty decent. The rooms are more like those i have experienced in hostels rather than that of a hotel. That said we paid £90/$160 for 4 nights - i think they miscalculated, but I would have begrudged paying anymore. If you like no frills and just need a bed then stay here. Although, it may have just been me, but the sheets on the bed caused extreme amounts on static and i continually got static shocks from things, so bring your own sheet!\r\nI would not recommend against staying here, but there are better quality hostels in New York, for the same cost if not less in just as good an area of the city. It is a place i would recommend to friends but not my parents.'
5,'Great location and price','We stayed at the NY Hilton over labor day weekend. We also booked through priceline at $117 per night. Over all we enjoyed our stay. We checked ourselves in at a kiosk in the lobby, and were able to select a newly renovated room on the 20th floor. We were impressed that we were able to check into our room at 10 AM, so we did not have to check our bags. The room itself was large, nicely decorated, and quiet. The only complaint that I have is that internet was $10 per day, which seems steep for a wireless connection... but this seems to be standard practice these days. We were a little nervous about this hotel after reading some reviews posted here, but we had a great experience. I guess it pays to check your self in!'
5,'High Kudos','I have now stayed at the Hudson twice, both booked through Priceline. When I found I was staying there again, I was overjoyed.\r\nWhile the Hudson is very trendy, it is also a wonderful hotel because of the location, the decor and quiet rooms. It is located within walking distance of Lincoln Center, Fifth Avenue and Central Park. It has a lot of rooms so the staff can help if you want to upgrade. You arrive and there is no sign. You travel up a steep escalator to a cavernous lobby decorated with vines growing to the tall ceiling. Behind the lobby is an outdoor bar/restaurant and another indoor restaurant. On the other side of the lobby is the indoor bar/disco. To the side is a large library which is quieter, has a pool table and a fireplace and internet access as well as bar facilities.\r\nFor the standard room, you pay a bit much because the rooms are beautifully decorated but tiny. Both times we stayed we asked the staff to upgrade us and they did a great job. This time the hotel was a bit busy but the receptionist searched and found us a perfect room, a bit larger and very quiet. Plus she was very friendly, chatting with us about our vacation and sharing experiences.\r\nOverall, I think it is a great find. If you are into the trend scene (I\'m not), there is a lot of that. But if you are not into that, you can simply sit in the lobby or the library and watch people. Plus the location cannot be beat. \r\nKudos to the Hudson.'
4,'A good hotel','Lo mejor fue la ubicación. El hotel es bueno. Le faltaría un poco de mantenimiento. Pero las camas son muy buenas y cómodas. Abajo hay un restaurant con desayuno y para mi sorpresa bastante bueno. Le falta un poco mas de limpieza y empezar a renovar los muebles'
5,'Location,Location, large room!!!','Stayed here Oct 2011 - the hotel is in an amazing location, just 1/2 block (barely) from Times Square!!!! Surprisingly not much street noise at all and I\'m a very light sleeper!!! Very nice lobby, quick check in, helpful front desk! Had a dbl queen room - was huge by NY standards, great for 3-4 people!!! Our bathroom was very large-sink long enough for 2 to do hair/makeup, etc...had a wonderful view of the river -- room was clean, beds were comfortable! Breakfast buffet was great! Will definitely stay here again!!!'
2,'Pleasantly surprised','Firstly the negatives:-\r\nThe decorating was seriously in need of updating\r\nPlaster falling off the walls\r\nNo plug in bathroom sink\r\nBathroom door swollen too big to close\r\nThe positives:-\r\nWe had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from our window\r\nClean sheets and towels every day\r\nLots of hot water from a great power shower.\r\nSuperkingsize bed\r\nNo bugs, mice,cockoaches or other un-invited room guests (as noted by some other reviewers)\r\nWe\'d read some really awful reviews before going and almost changed hotels. Glad we didn\'t - it was basic but location makes up for it. We asked the receptionist - Sheila - for a room with a view and she was only too happy to oblige. \r\nClose to lots of the sights and we would also recommend Andrews for great breakfasts (turn right out of Hotel a couple of blocks up on the same side as Hotel)\r\nDon\'t go expecting too much from Hotel Pennsylvania and you won\'t be disappointed.'
2,'Location, location, location','All you can really say about this hotel (which prides itself on being one of the oldest in NYC) is that it is central and within striking distance of major tourist attractions. The facilities have been franchised out and the Diner off the front lobby is overpriced (The Tick Tock or Starlight a couple of blocks away are better). There also plenty of local delis where you can get breakfast or sandwiches made up. The rooms and hallways are well past their sell by date and pretty gloomy - we were all struck by its resemblance to the backdrop of The Shining and half expected to bump into Jack Nicholson doing his psychopath impersonation every time we took the lift.\r\nThankfully we didn\'t come to NY to stay in a hotel and preferred to eat and drink elsewhere mainly because we wanted to but also because you have no choice.'
3,'It all about the room you get','I actually stayed here in a few different rooms...don\'t ask, not the hotel\'s problem. But I did get to see rooms in a few different floors and with different layouts. Yes, the executive rooms are better but some are really small but the breakfast is nice. Then there are the newly remodeled rooms and the not newly remodeled rooms....which does make a large difference. Finally the view, in NY, it makes a HUGE difference in the coolness factor. The location is great but in Manhattan, there are few locations which are not great.'
3,'Leery at first, happy ending','When we first saw the room, it was huge, but also a little scary. There were 2 beds, which I had requested as I was travelling with my children, and the room was Huge! so big, in fact, that when you laid in bed to watch TV you couldn\'t see it (and that was to my kids 13 and 14 year old eyes as well as my 45 year old eyes). There was a separate room also (I believe it was a changing room, which worked out beautifully). Our view was onto the other side of the hotel, meaning we had no view, but as I learned from other guests that was great because it was very quiet! No street noise, at all, to speak of. The bathroom was the big down side. It needs work. I didn\'t want to take a shower there, but once I did I was surprised once again because the pressure was great, the water hot, and again I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n The LOCATION was phenomenal!! In the middle of it all.\r\n When I go to NY again, I won\'t seek out this hotel, but I also wouldn\'t say No Way.'
4,'First hotel in New York','I checked into the Hilton New York on October 29th 2011, the day New York had an unexpected snow storm. The front desk was very nice and understanding to my friends and I for arriving in around 9:00 p.m. at night due to delays from Chicago. After checking in we walked into our room and were amazed how nice it was. After unpacking we headed down to the concierge desk for some information on what clubs or bars we should hit up that night. Thankfully we had a great Concierge by the name of Winny who told us what the hot places were with only a couple blocks from the hotel. Her directions were flawless and made our long day a great night. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel, set aside from our evening on Sunday night at the hotel. My friends and I stopped by the concierge desk again and unfortunately Winny was not there, but another concierge greeted us warmly by the name of Eugenia. As we began to talk we told her where we wanted to go and she wasn’t sure of the exact location, which is fine because I myself a concierge at another hotel based out of Chicago doesn’t always know where everything is in such a big city. After Eugenia printed us off the directions she explained what train to take vaguely (later getting lost for about an hour because she wasn’t specific enough on what train to take). But what really got me upset was the fact that she mentioned an ignorant comment about people who don’t speak English. She said she cannot stand when guests don’t speak English because she can’t understand. I was confused why she would say this because as a concierge in a popular tourist city, being ignorant to others inability to speak clear English is very unprofessional, and the hospitality industry is no place for someone like that. I had a great experience overall, but just found that Eugenia’s personality for the concierge desk is unprofessional and it sets a bad name for Hilton.'

4,'LOVELY HOTEL - WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN!','I was very impressed with this hotel. I found a high standard of cleanliness and our room (a two-bedded suite with view of the Empire State Building) to be a good size, especially for New York!! As we were on the 32nd floor, we did not find outside noise a problem at all and the room\'s heating/air conditioning worked very well. The bathroom was modern and clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. If you timed it wrong you could wait rather a long time to check in at reception and the receptionist forget to give us our breakfast vouchers when we checked in (we booked b+b with Letsgo2 travel company). However, this was quickly resolved on the first morning.\r\nI have previously stayed at the Hotel Wellington in New York - after my experience there I would definitely choose the New Yorker over that one!!\r\nThe hotel was in a good location, a short walk from the Empire State, Macy\'s, subway stations. I thought the New Yorker Hotel was excellent value for money and would love to stay there again.'
5,'New York City For The 3rd Time :)','After visiting New York City twice before and staying in Times Square, we decided to stay in a different Hotel The Grand Hyatt This hotel is amazing. Upon arrival we were greeted by pleasant door men and the interior of the Hotel is beautiful. Very quick check in, Very Big, Comfy & Clean rooms. Excellent views of the Chysler Building, Empire State Building and within 5 min walk to 5th Ave!!! Plenty of Pizza places over the road and TGI\'s is within 5 min walk. Times Square 10 min walk, Macy\'s 20 min walk. Going at this time of year is lovely as you get to still see the xmas decorations and Central Park is breath taking around 5pm!! I love this City! A must for all travellers. I would definately recomment this hotel!!!!! :)'
5,'Wonderful stay at the Westin, Times Square','Enjoyed a wonderful stay in New York City at the Westin, Times Square. Took them up on a web-site offer of a May weekend upgrade to Club accommodation. Large room with their signature Heavenly Bed and Bath-sure felt great after all the walking we did in hot weather. Enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast as well as a great steak dinner in Shula\'s Steak House. Some reports don\'t advocate for a Times Square location however we rather enjoyed the close proximity and the activity. \r\n1st time visitors make sure you take the double decker bus tours-our guides were like stand up\r\ncomedians! Go early to enjoy the Empire State building without the long lineup. Spent the last day enjoying Central Park despite advise of not much there. On the contrary-a beautiful park in the heart of the city with loads of activity and great people watching. \r\nWill return again to NYC and the Westin at Times Square.'
5,'NYC Overnight','Stayed for an 1 night getaway. Great location, right smack in the middle of Times Square. Loved the glass elevator ride up to our room on the 42nd floor. Great view of lower Manhattan and Hudson River. Newly renovated rooms.'
3,'Anthony (HGVC desk) made all the difference!','As Gold HHonors members we have come to expect a certain standard. The hotel was great but the room size was a lot to be desired and this was after being upgraded. The gym was great! Breakfast was great but expensive. Not sure if we\'d stay here again if we come back to New York, would be inclined to try another Hilton.'
4,'Good Value Relative to Other Manhattan Hotels','My first reaction staying here was: Wow, what a lot of tourists! and was kind of worried that I\'d be awake all night listening to people partying in their rooms, street noise, etc. But that wasn\'t the case. My room was on a high floor and well insulated against noise. You heard some stuff, but once you draw the curtains, the room is pretty dark and quiet allowing a good night\'s sleep.\r\nMy second reaction is that the hotel is BIG. You walk into the lobby, look straight up and realize that there are something like 50 floors with what appear to be 100 rooms per floor. Probably not that much, nonetheless it\'s an impressive sight. There are glass elevators that go all the way up. Maybe a concern if you\'re acrophobic.\r\nVia the elite desk, check in was pretty fast. For guests without elite status, there was a line, but it seemed to be moving. At least, no one was grumbling ... not even a family with four kids.\r\nThis hotel obviously gets a lot of traffic. The halls looked like they\'d been redone in the past few years, but even so the rugs are getting dingy in high-traffic areas. I had a colleague with a room similar to mine and both showed wear (chipped counters, scratched furniture, etc.), though both were also very clean.\r\nRooms were large relative to most New York hotels and included a king size bed (which was very comfortable), desk and work area, a couch, coffee table, separate chair with ottoman, large dresser, and still leave plenty of room to unpack and mill about. I ordered room service (where they brought in a trolley with the meal) with two colleagues and I working in the room; there was still room to move around, use the desk, sit on the couch, etc. I visit New York several times a year -- most hotel rooms are cozy, to use a kind word, even at luxury hotels. Usually there\'s barely enough room to open your suitcase.\r\nRoom service was ok but not great. I used it several times and it was hit or miss. The food quality was fine, but the service was at times a little off. They made mistakes on at least one order, though they corrected it quickly.\r\nInternet service, workspace amenities, business center, fitness center, etc. were all pretty good. The hotel has everything except a pool. There are several restaurants ... I ate at the View which has a nice view of Times Square and one of the lobby restaurants. Both were fine.\r\nThe hotel\'s highlight other than size and space is its location. It\'s right in the middle of Times Square which depending on your point of view is either really good or really bad. Even with the change in traffic patterns (i.e., the city shut down parts of Broadway and made them pedestrian zones), it\'s still very crowded -- packed with tourists. But it is convenient for midtown business, transportation, etc. and at a decent price. I got a corporate rate that was about $275 before tax.\r\nOverall, a pretty good hotel for the price relative to what\'s available in NYC.'
4,'Very basic but location fantastic.','The reviews on here pretty much say it all. If you are in New York for a special occasion or want a real hotel experience, then this is not the hotel for you. If you want to avoid expensive NYC hotels, have a great location, and just somewhere to rest your head in-between exploring NYC then this is probably the hotel for you.\r\nIt\'s basic, it\'s very basic, but the location pretty much unbeatable. Right near Times Square it\'s great for shopping, eating, and also for public transport. If you are on a budget, and are going to be sightseeing for most of the time, then I would say book this place for sure.'
3,'Pretty Good .....','Our visit here (with 2 small children) started off being dumped on the curb by the cab with a vomiting child, nowhere near the main entrance !!!! Bad start but not the hotels fault. Cab driver claimed he could not find main entrance however told my parents the same thing when they arrived !! \r\nThe front desk service was exceptional. We were offered a free bar fridge as we had little ones and were very sympathetic with our sick little girl. Although it was early in the morning they changed our room to one that was availble there and then. We were very impressed. Small but clean rooms with pretty impressive views.We also found a laundry however it was at least half hours walk. But it came in handy. \r\nnfortunately the good service stopped at the front desk. While the bell man was awesome, the doorman service to get a cab was disgustuing and we were not happy. We were ignored, told to go out on the street to get a cab and then sent back to doorman who again ignored our request. (there were taxis lined up, he just needed to blow his whistle!!) the lovely bellman finally called one for us however we were late for our tour.\r\nThe hotel is in times square literally and has a real buzz to it. A couple of nights would have been enough though as we should have stayed more central to other attractions within walking distance. Dont get me wrong, plenty around in times square, but 2 days would have been enough for us. It is a major toursit attraction and tourists are all you will see !! \r\nThis is the main reason why we would stay elseware on our next visit to new york. ie in the west village or similar. Much easier to get cabs, wasnt touristy and locals were much friendlier. New York is not and easy place to get around if you are relying on cabs, which we did because of the kids, in my opinion it was the worst place we could have stayed for us.\r\nIt is a real touristy area and they just dont like tourists. as a result we dropped our heads and didnt see half of what we wanted to .... \r\nOverall pretty good place to stay for a couple of nights to see times square and surrounds. But wouldnt base myself there !'
3,'Excellent location!','We stayed for 5 nights at the beginning of June and this was my second stay at the hotel. Our room were on the 12th floor but my room was very different to my parents even though we were only 5 rooms apart. My room was newly refurbished,bathroom rather small but modern fittings and my parents was old and in desperate need for a make over. I found the bed to be very uncomfortable and woke up every morning with a bad back. We didn\'t bother to complain about the cleanliness of the room as we only slept in there. Please be aware that the are no safes in the room they are behind reception. The location of the hotel is perfect, 1 minute walk from the hotel and you are directly on Broadway/Times Square. The staff are very helpful and you will be asked to show your room key as you enter the hotel for security.\r\nWe didn\'t bother arranging airport transfers and we found it very easy to get a taxi from the hotel BUT we were scammed when we arrived at JFK, the taxi states a 45 dollar fee to the airport but yet when we arrived he charged us 60 and then even had the cheek to want a tip. We ended up paying 65 dollars in total which is 20 dollars more than what we paid when we arrived.\r\nIf you leave your bags with the hotel once you have checked out then they charge 50cents per bag. We stayed in 2007 and we didn\'t pay any charge then.\r\nOverall I would recommend staying at the Edison for the location alone but don\'t expect luxury rooms!!'
5,Impressive!,'On a sold-out weekend before Christmas, I was NOT expecting the perfect service we experienced at the massive Marriott Marquis. The staff -- from bellmen to housekeeping -- were exceptional in every way. Kudos to the management for maintaining such an efficient, pleasant staff in an enormous hotel in the middle of the busiest area in the United States -- Times Square. \r\nFor those who haven\'t visited this hotel for a while, it is definitely time to give it a second look. The lobby, elevators, and rooms have been renovated. The layout of the rooms are fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about our experience there.\r\nA big shout-out to Riz, our bellman. You truly are an asset to the hotel staff. Keep smiling!'
4,'NYE in NYC','My husband and I stayed here from the 28 Dec until 2Jan. On arrival check in was quick and easy very friendly and helpful. We were given a standard guest room on the 18th Floor overlooking 7th Avenue. The room was beautifully presented, yes the bathroom was tiny but functional, I used the drawer and the base of the basin unit to store toiletries. The complimentary Philosophy toiletries are gorgeous. The shower excellent and everywhere spotless. The beds are just to die for!!! Yes there was noise but after pounding the streets of NY even as an ultra light sleeper those beds just took you to dream land! Day 2 we arrived back to our room to change before heading out again to find a leak had happened in the shaft next to our room, no damage to our room but the Hotel were moving us due to the noise and inconveniene. All was taken care of with efficiency, politeness full of apologies and our bags and us were moved to a room on the 12th floor. This room was bigger, with a large bathroom and tub and walk in closet. We had breakfast at Niles a couple of times and would recommend 20\% discount for guests, and the price is no more expensive than the other eateries we sampled. This hotel has tons of character it\'s 120 years old so yes there are some rattles in the wind and such, but it is a beautiful hotel and the staff are so friendly nothing is too much trouble. Its perfect location meant it was ideal to do all the touristy trips with ease as well as wander around at leisure taking in all New York has to offer, it\'s opposite Penn Station,Madsion Sq Grdns, close to Macy\'s, the Empire State, Times Square, just over 2 mile walk from Central Park and roughly the same from the Piers and the Circle Line, we walked them all as my feet will testify! I would definitely return to the Affinia, the service was the old fashioned customer service that has long since gone in most places for that alone it is worth it, but add on those beds and wow!!! I would next time ask for a larger room/studio as although there is a coffee maker in the room it\'s not the same as good fresh coffee, and we got take outs from Starbucks across the road. All in all a great trip the only negative was NYE in Times Sq- what a let down and a rip off but that is in another review of the ticket company.'
2,'Oh My God ...','What can I say ... except I wish I\'d known about TripAdvisor before I booked for the Pennsylvania. Mind it was a bit naive to think it would be great just because Glenn Miller and his Orchestra stayed and played there - in all honesty ... that and the hotel location ARE the ONLY things going for it.\r\nI agree that the lobby was great but oh-so deceptive as when you got off the lift and onto the hallways ... well, I thought I was in a different hotel. The stains on the carpets / walls / ceilings were v.scary and led me to wonder just what had been going on @ this hotel ... immediate visions of pimps & murderers sprang to mind ... and I\'m not a paranoid person.\r\nIt got worse tho ... the rooms ... UGH! Stains were NO better and the furniture was like someting out of a bad 70\'s porno ... call me old-fashioned but peeling, filthy wallpaper just ain\'t my style.\r\nAnyway, got the room changed which was marginally better (nice beige, neutral tones as opposed to the grey / pink / splatter / strangely floral look of the previous room) ... some attempt @ rennovation had been made tho the square patch of old paint on the wall where the previous mirror had been was quite amusing. The bathroom was clean as were the beds but the carpets ... well, I didn\'t care to look that closely after the 1st room. If I\'d gotten this room in the first instance, I probably wouldn\'t have minded so much ... even not being able to close the window wasn\'t so bad in the end.\r\nOn my return to the UK - a conversation with a colleague led to the discovery that he had also stayed there years before ... we didn\'t need to say much about it, the knowing glances said it all. So there you go ... not a lot being done by the hotel / management to improve the situation.'
5,'Great Stay','My self and my wife, BIL, and SIL stayed here back in June of 2007. THis was a GREAT hotel. I have seen that the rates have doubled since last year. I was hoping for a return stay this year, but we payed 220 a night last summer and now the rates are about 500. I don\'t understand the drastic increase. The amenities we teriffic, the hotel was extremely clean. All of the staff were helpful and attentive. Just a great overall stay.'
5,'Wonderful Environment','Lobby and rooms were modern and peaceful. Only stayed 1 night and got the room through Priceline at over 50\% off internet rates on Hyatt\'s site. Parking in the hotel garage is $50/day, but we found street parking for free on Sunday, then moved to a garage around the corner that night. The hotel has an entrance in Grand Central Station, which connects to the subway system. Loved returning here at night after walking miles and miles during the day. Bathroom was a little small, but the rest of the room was spacious. Perfect for business travelers or those on a romantic getaway.'
5,'NYC again this was the best yet...... :-)','We arrived at the New Yorker at 2:30pm and check in was very efficient... The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgable. Having read a few reviews I was a little concerned but I had no reson to be. The rooms were very clean and of a great standard...they weren\'t huge but they were plenty big enough for myself and friend. We had a double bed each and the beds were so comfortable to get into after busy days and nights out seeing the sights and shopping...the tik tok diner was downstairs in through a door in the lobby which made it real easy to go get breakfast and then nip back to our room to get what we needed for the day. It was in a great location for walking to times square etc. and the empire state build was just a little further along the road. It was a sight we were greated with when we walked out in the morning, the hotel is diagonally across from Maddison Square Gardens, and also penn st station. \r\nI would definately recommend this hot to anyone travelling to New York whether it be your first time or a repeat visit there. I have stayed in a few hotels in NYC and this so far is my favourite. \r\nI would stay in this hotel again, but before I return to this one there are a few more I want to try there first. \r\nYou do need to take a debit card with you as they check it in case of any damage caused. They don\'t charge anything however...'
5,'AMAZING hotel highly suggest staying in Time Square','My husband and I had a lay over in the city. We were three hours late getting in so our time was cut even shorter. Arrive at the hotel 11:45pm – depart for the airport 1:00pm the next day. Marriott Marquis Time Square AMAZING there is no doubt Time Square is the place to stay. Our room was on the 18th floor with a breathtaking view of the Square. We went up to the revolving View Lounge I believe its located on the 48th floor of the hotel. It gives you amazing views of the city because it constantly turning. We each had two beers and with tip we spent $50.00 not too bad was expecting more. Next we hit the streets of Time Square. For $50.00 we took a 20 minute carriage ride around the Square and it was great, the man was very friendly and full of information when we asked, he took a lot of pictures of my husband and I and we were able to take some beautiful pictures along the way. Next we set off to see some of the sites, HBO building, where David Letterman show is, walked many blocked and saw all sorts of famous spots along the way and didn’t even realize they were there until we stumbled upon them. For dinner we decided we didn’t want to slow down and have a sit down meal so we ate at one of the street vendors DELISH!!!! For $12 we were able to get 2 HUGE Gyros they were the best I’ve ever eaten the man making them was super friendly as well. About 3am we called it a night but the city was still very much alive and busy. The next morning we woke up to a down pour but we didn’t care we are going out and having a blast. We purchased 2 umbrellas for $10 and away we went, still soaked but it was great! Walked to the Empire State Building, didn’t go all the way to the top as we wouldn’t have been able to see anything due to the rain but went to the simulator and that was ok not great but ok. Stopped by My Daddy’s Pizza for a quick lunch, not all that great either, and back to the hotel for our luggage. For the amount of time we were there I felt as though we were able to see quite a bit. It left me knowing I am very excited to plan a trip to New York City and really get to experience all it has to offer.'
4,'Great Location, Clean, Friendly Staff - Great Experience','When I chose this hotel, I was hesitant because of its Time Square location (most hotels in the area are subpar, at best) but this hotel is by far one of the best NYC hotels I have stayed in. Upon arrival I was welcomed by very friendly staff and was impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel. The hotel room was large by NYC standards and well appointed for $260 night. The only negative I can report about the hotel, and it\'s nothing serious, is that all beverages in the mini-bar are kept warm and you will need to get ice to chill water, wine, etc. (more inconvenient and annoying than anything). Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting NYC, you won\'t be disappointed.'
3,'Park Central - Great location','The staff at Park Central in NY,NY were extremely helpful. They assisted my mom, sister and me in getting a cab back to LGA airport. After reading the reviews on trip advisor, I requested a lower level room so I did not have to ride the elevator - they accomodated this request. My sister and mom took the elevator without any problems over the weekend. \r\nthis is a great place to stay if you plan on seeing New York and not spending time in your hotel room without needing to use a lot of transportation.'
3,'Front desk: smile and say Yes and  I\'ll see what I can do, that\'s your job, really','If you want to stay near Times Square, the park and MoMA, the Park Central is probably the best bang for your buck. But location is pretty much the only thing they\'ve got that is much better than average.\r\nWhen we got to the hotel, after a 9 hour flight that was 4 hours delayed from the start, we pretty much just wanted to get checked in quickly and with a smile, get a bite to eat and go to sleep.\r\nWhat we got was a front desk that treated us like we were a bother rather than welcome guests. That kind of set the mood for the following days.\r\nThe rest of the staff: house keeping, bellboys, room service and the car service made up for it somewhat though.\r\nAlso, $14/day for WiFi... Come on, who charges separately for internet access these days?\r\nWe got the infamous brick wall-view, but since I knew this might be a possibility, it was more like a ironic joke (stay on the 19th floor and the view is... bricks) than a real inconvenience. At least we weren\'t disturbed by lights or traffic.\r\nWe had dinner once at the restaurant in the hotel (Cityhouse), and all of us enjoyed it. It was early and it seemed lika a slow evening, so I\'m guessing the service was a little better than normal. I might come back even if I\'m not staying at the hotel.'
1,'Just don\'t stay here','I had to go to NYC during fashion week, so the pickings for hotels were slim. I paid extra for an upgrade at this hotel when I booked it. It quickly became clear that I\'d been ripped off.\r\nThe wait at the reception desk was at least 20 minutes. Upon entering the room, I found stains and a hole in the wall, plus water damage to the ceiling. The room, which was supposed to be a King size, had a double bed. The carpet was filthy. The bathroom had a lot of rust and mildew. The towels were yellowed. \r\nI called the front desk to express my concerns and was told to go back to the front desk for another room. When I went downstairs, the line was twice as long and would have taken a half hour wait. I decided to run an errand and address the issue again.\r\nWhen I returned to my room, I called a manager - a tremendously rude man who told me that my room was not an upgrade and that he wouldn\'t help me out. When I explained the problems with the room, he offered to move me to a smaller room. At this point, I didn\'t care about size - just cleanliness.\r\nA bellman brought me a new key to a room down the hall. It was smaller, but in some ways better. There was less general damage, although there were still water stains in the ceiling. There was less rust in the bathroom, but the mildew in the shower was pretty significant. The sink leaked a steady stream, and the shower dripped all night. Fortunately, the insanely loud a/c unit blocked out most of that sound.\r\nIn the morning I found out that the bathroom outlets did not work.\r\nI could not find my free breakfast but I didn\'t care. I went to Lindy\'s on the first floor of the hotel and had abysmal service, cold coffee, and an overpriced bagel.\r\nI\'ve been to very nice mid-priced hotels in NYC. This one was nowhere near the value I\'ve received in the past. The staff was rude, unhelpful, combative; the hotel is outdated and dark; and the rooms are disgusting.\r\nJust don\'t stay here.'
4,'Davvero bello e centrale,ma caro!','Ho alloggiato in quest\'hotel a dicembre 2011.Molto bello e grande ma sopratutto in una posizione centrale.Alla reception c\'è molto personale,nella hall ci sono piccoli monitor dove puoi prenotare l\'ascensore senza aspettare troppo! Le camere sono molto spaziose e la pulizia non è affatto male. Letti comodissimi,bagno piccola ma pratico.Data la temperatura fredda di dicembre il condizionatore riscaldava perfettamente tutta la camera. Sono anche molto fiscali qui,io avevo dimenticato la scheda per entrare in camera e i documenti non sono serviti per consegnarmene un\'altra,ho dovuto aspettare la security che mi accompagnasse su.....Cmq per visitare NYC è buonissimo per la posizione,ma troppo caro per dormirci soltanto.La mattina in hall c\'è un grazioso Bakery dove puoi comprare dolcetti e muffins davvero ottimi. \r\nLo consiglio sia per la sua posizione,che per la sua efficienza. Ma sappiate che tutto ha un prezzo ;)'
5,'Had a great stay','I was a little weary about staying here based on some of the reviews but since I used hotwire I couldn\'t change it. Let me say, I don\'t know what some people expect from places. I\'m sure there are some bad stories with hotels, but I really think people nit-pick everything. The Hudson staff was very friendly, there was not loud music blasting in the lobby and elevator. I would say the staff was one of the best I\'ve dealt with honestly,\r\nThe rooms are small, but it wasn\'t small enough to make me feel uncomfortable. I stayed with my wife and we had no problems walking around in the room. The bathroom is tight so if you are a bigger person you might have some problems, but I\'m sure you could manage.\r\nWe ordered room service our first night and they told us it would be 30 minutes. 33 minutes later the phone rang and it was the room service staff and they said the dinner would be free because it wasn\'t on time. Maybe 2 minutes later there was a knock on the door and our food was there. I couldn\'t believe it.\r\nAnyone considering this hotel should give it a shot, my wife and I loved and we would stay there in a heartbeat.'
5,'Excellent hotel in a fantastic location.','My wife and I stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights in early August as part of our holiday to America’s east coast.\r\nThe hotel is a very nice, comfortable and clean in a great location.\r\nAs a Hilton Honours member staying on Honours points we were upgraded to one of the re furbished king rooms. The room was superb and spacious (for a New York hotel) with a two seater sofa, flat screen TV and mini bar.\r\nThe only thing I could criticise with regards to the room is the size of the bathroom (shower only). It was very new and modern though small (this probably enabled the bedroom to be larger which suited us, however I think some may be disappointed in this).\r\nThe check in, concierge service and hotel travel centre were all fast and efficient. At certain times however it appears that there are not enough staff on the check in/check out desk and we had to queue for some time on check out. Other than this minor point we had a fantastic three night stay.\r\nGreat hotel for business or pleasure.\r\nIf you fancy a pleasant eating experience and maybe a few drinks try the oldest surviving tavern in New York. The Bridge Café is located in a simple wood-frame building erected in 1794 on Water Street near the Brooklyn Bridge, Lower Manhattan. Not close to the hotel but well worth a visit if in Lower Manhattan. Try the Buffalo burger or steak, awesome.\r\nA couple of other recommended restaurants - \r\nThe Tribeca Grill. A 20 minute cab ride from the hotel to the Tribeca area of Manhattan. This modern restaurant co-owned by Robert De Niro. Not cheap but excellent food and a great atmosphere, worth a visit.\r\nDos Caminos, a Mexican restaurant in Midtown. Probably the best fresh guacamole I have ever tasted. Excellent modern bar and restaurant with a great atmosphere and fantastic Mexican food, well worth a visit.\r\nI could go on forever, enjoy NYC.'
4,'Central Location','Just come back from 5 nights in NYC, stayed at the New Yorker Hotel. Well what can I say, it\'s location is fantastic for all the sights with subway and LIRR stations just across the road. Then staff were on the whole friendly but the belboys have the best information and the reception staff can be a bit frosty. Sure they\'ve had the same question a million times but it\'s what they are there for!!!! The accommodation is adequate but not very spacious still after a day\'s sightseeing you only need a bed....... On the whole lovely and would stay again.'
4,'Excellent location although a little expensive','Stayed at Marriott Marquis in September 2010 as the first hotel on our US Trip. Had flown all the way from Australia via LAX and we had requested a room with a Times Square view. That is exactly what we got and the view was spectacular. We found the Times Square location perfect in the middle of theatre district and relatively close to everything. We did find the person (Greg) at the check in desk rather bland and we commented quickly about his total lack of personality....this found to be the case on more than one occasion for this person. Everyone else was fantastic and the Concierge were great. Room wa spacious clean with a great view. Internet was around $15.00 per day with free wi-fi only in the lobby. We did find the room prices and the room service prices a little expensive although I am not really surprised being New York and being so centrally located..... in summary it was great and we would stay there again'
5,Excellent,'We have stayed in 6 hotels in New York and this has to be one of the best for both location and size of the room. The Receptionist said that she would take pity on my husband as we were travelling with our 17 yr old daughter by giving us a room with 2 bathrooms to go with the 2 double beds! Both were full bathrooms and the room was a good size. The hotel is in a good location opposite Penn Station, handy for a short walk to Times Square and a little longer walk to Ground Zero and Grenwich Village. All staff who we came into contact with we\'re very pleasant. We went to the restaurant on the corner for breakfast which was very reasonable. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone.'
5,Ottimo,'L Hotel e\' situato al centro...grazie alla sua posizione e\' facile giungere alla quinta strada, oltre al Park Central...Sin dal primo giorno siamo stati accolti da un personale molto gentile, e altamente qualificato come Elisabeth addetta alla reception, la quale parla diverse lingue come l\'italiano....Ringraziamo tutto lo staff dell\'albergo..'
1,'Good hotel, great location but poor security (laptop stolen from my room)','My laptop was stolen from the room while I was away watching my sister run the marathon. The hotel does not have security cameras on guest floor aisles or restrict access to guest floors by use of room key on elevators. Apparently only cleaning staff accessed the room during the period the computer was lost. I reported the loss to hotel security and NYPD. I believe hotel security did not make a serious effort to search the place for my laptop. Hotel staff adopted a defensive attitude and said the case would be handled by their insurance company. I provided documentation proving I owned a laptop as described. Three weeks later, an insurance representative left a message ( no phone # to call back) saying they could not claim liability so I will not get reimbursed. One month later, I received an -email from hotel management denying any wrong doing. My conclusion is that hotel management does not care. They will continue to do good business with their privileged location. For me, I guess their message is  Hey, what do you expect? It\'s New York. Go back to Honduras and stop bothering with your fake story. I am sure they will rush to counter this review with a generic ISO 9001 answer: we apologize for any inconvenience...My advice to you patient reader: pick another hotel in the vicinity with better security. I should have done that.'
1,Abysmal,'The Park Central hotel is truly abysmal. I had the misfortune of having to stay here on a recent 5 day business trip. (i tried to change but NY was apparently full up). On entering you are greeted by a lobby that is so busy its like being on the concourse of Grand Central station. There are faded Warhol-style prints of Judy Garland decorating the lobby - this may have been cool in the early 1980s ( when i presume this hotel was last decorated) but not now. The staff on reception are, at best, disinterested and at worst rude depending on how you catch them. On getting out of the elevator, you are greeted by a foul, worn and stained dark blue carpet. Everything is tatty, beat up and tired. If you are really unlucky, like my colleague, you may bump into a random drunk wandering the corridor - whether a guest or wandered up unnoticed from the hubbub of reception is unknown. There is a drinks machine and a water machine, which would have been useful since there is NO minibar, however they were both out of order for the duration of my stay. There was no effort at repair - I\'m guessing they\'ve been like that for months. After negotiating your way past abandoned room service trolleys left in the corridor, I then had to pass room 1046. The stench emanating from around this room suggests something died there a while ago and lies decaying and as yet undiscovered. There are a couple of positives (yes it\'s true), the rooms are large, linen seems clean and crisp and bed is large and comfortable. But the room is drab with brownish decor, beat up furniture, few pictures on the wall and is just downright depressing to spend any time in. The key card seems to wipe itself every other day, requiring a tedious journey back to reception to wait in line and face surly staff to get it reset. And all this can be yours for a mere $350 a night (plus $14 a night for wifi - with all these trials, no free wifi - really?). If you knocked the zero off, this would be much closer to what the stay is worth in my book. Needless to say, I shall not be back.'
3,'Cheap and Convenient','This hotel is ideal for a budget holiday. If you are trying to save the pennies to splash out when you get there stay here. Its in a great location (a couple of minutes to Macys, opposite Madison Square Gardens, etc), the subway is over the road.\r\n The rooms, granted, are not top rate and the place could do with an full refurb, but I would in no way call this place unpleasant. \r\n Service is as you\'d expect from such a massive, busy hotel so w had to queue for about 10-15mins to check in. The key drop meant we walked straight out (we didn\'t have any extras to settle). \r\n Lindys (the restaurant attached) is nice if slightly overpriced.\r\n If you are planning on a trip to NYC where you will spend most of your time out and about, this place is ideal.\r\n Two words to sum it up cheap and convenient.'
4,'Excellent Choix','Hôtel Art Déco vraiment à découvrir. Très bien rénové et vous avez l\'impression de reculer dans les année 40...Nous avions une vue imprenable sur Empire State Building....à pied de Times Squares....Il y a un gardien qui vérifie votre acrréditation à l\'hôtel avant de pouvoir accéder aux ascenseur..Très sécuritaire. J\'y retournerais sans hésiter. Le personnel très sympa.'
3,'There are better places and the frustration is not worth it.','This place is in a great location across the street from Penn Station, but that doesn\'t make up for poor quality. No towels on two of our three nights. It took over an hour to get them. Not fun waiting when you want to go to bed. Ice was even harder to get. No place to get it on your own. You have to call and ask for it. Over 1.5 hrs later and none. Sigh. As much as I like independent hotels, this just isn\'t with it.'
5,'Best Hotel in Times Square','Recently stayed here for my birthday weekend with my husband. It was the best expereince that I beleive we could have had with a hotel.\r\nCheck-In - Easy and Fast\r\nRooms - We booked the Atrium Room (special on Expedia - highly recommend). The room had a Mac Computer and 42 inch flat screen. It was spacious and recently revnovated. The bed was comfortable and the view was awesome. Our view was Madame Tussant and Ripley Believer or Not.\r\nAttrium Room Extras - we were able to enjoy complimentary breakfast, mid day snack and evening snacks. Free sodas and TVs everyone. The service was excellent.\r\nAround Area - The hotel was connected to AMC theater and in a excellent location. I recommend eating at Bubba Gumps, West Wood Cafe, and Lucille. You must take the Open Roof Tour it was fun\r\nThe bellman wer very knowledge and could point you in any direction for anything. I would stay here again anytime. The hotel is nice, clean and accessible to all thing times square.\r\nThe only downfall was they had construction going on during the day. It is not that loud, but enough to be irraiting at times for a mid afternoon night. \r\nOther than that highly recommend.'
4,'Great location, grand old hotel, huge suite for NYC','We stayed here for one night after a road trip to Canada, before we flew home to Australia. After staying elsewhere previously on the upper west side, we found the location of this hotel fantastic, as it was walking distance to times square, but close to a few subway stations and directly opposite Penn Station/Madison square gardens. It was also a block away from Macy\'s. My wife checked in for us, as I was returning the rental car, o when I got o the room, she told me that whilst we were supposed to have two double beds and a tollways bed, we had been upgraded to a suite on the 24th floor, which was absolutely huuuge by NYC standards, with 2 bedrooms and a queen sofa bed in the living room, plus a full sized gantry kitchen. The hotel itself is a bit old, but well kept. One huge flaw is that reception is on level 1 with no elevator, so whilst you can get luggage up to reception by escalator, if you don\'t seek baggage assistance, it\'s very hard to get heavy cases out of the lobby. We didn\'t eat at the restaurant, but it looked like a very trendy bar, so we decided to give it a miss with our kids. I had a look at the gym, which seemed quite small with some very small windows overlooking a side street, but didn\'t use it, as it was my exercise rest day. It was expensive, as is everywhere in NYC, but we enjoyed it and would stay there again if we wanted to stay in midtown.'
2,'Thanksgiving Stay Just OK','This hotel is huge! There is something to be said for smaller hotels and service. I felt very lost in the busy shuffle and found the service to be awful. I am well aware of the cost in NYC and it being high, but to couple pricy for poor service is frustrating. I found the staff at the front desk to be very defensive and hassled. The staff at Crossroads (the restaurant) was very slow in service and rude when inquiring. Keep in mind, the cost for one egg white was nearly $14.\r\nAs a reward member, who has stayed in a lot of Marriott\'s, this by far is the worst visit. All in all, look elsewhere.'
5,'The perfect place to stay!','The service is always great, the room service is respecting the privacy of the guests.\r\nThe rooms are very clean and comfortable.\r\nThe concierge is excellent and give good advices.\r\nThe location is perfect.'
4,'Perfect for me, but not for everyone','I love when a hotel isn’t just a standard room with the standard bed, lounge chair, and bathroom. I can see how not everyone would appreciate visiting the hotel only to lose creature comforts like a plush rug or a high, cushy bed. But that is what I love about it. I love the details that make your eyes wander around the lobby, made me curious to flip over everything in the room, and made me appreciate how different this hotel was. In fact, it felt like my bizarro New York apartment that was dark and smoldery, but had key design features like a window between the bed and bathtub, or a hot silver desk with a clear plexi chair. I’ve stayed here 4 times now and no two room layouts have been the same reinforcing the idea that this was an old New York building converted to a modern hotel. I really dig this contrast aesthetically, but psychologically, it also makes me feel comfortable because it feels more like a pied a terre. The location also works for me because I’m a regular in NY and I didn’t need a central location to the tourist spots, but its location is very convenient to public transportation making it easy for me to get around. \r\nHowever, while I love it, not everyone will. It is dark and minimal and some rooms are quite small even for NY standards. It also lacks the convenience of a fridge in the room and doesn’t have the best temperature control. While staying there in the winter my heater wouldn’t shut off making it unbearably hot. Surprisingly, there is such a thing when the temperature outside is in the single digits. Another gripe is that the sheets are not uber soft, or a million thread count with the fluffiest goose down feather pillows. The elevators are sloooowwwww. I will admit the hotel is not perfect.\r\nFor me though, I’ve learned to look past the imperfections because I’ve grown to like the hotel, its design, and its courteous staff. I definitely have no complaints in that department. Would I recommend this hotel to my mother in law? No. Would I recommend this to my friends? Absolutely…with a tiny little asterisk.'
3,'Great hotel, but poor service','We stayed here in june, the hotel was very clean, excellent location, but the service(concierge) was very poor to the point of being unhelpful, which, as tourists trying to get info from locals on what to do, see, eat, was most annoying.'
1,'Horible, no renovation, filthy, bed bugs!!!!!!!!!!','this hotel is disgusting, Rather than renovating, they just paint over the mold and rust, and the mold is just coming out again. the shower head was coroding in the green mold, and it was plain disgusting, as for the hotel room, it smelt alot like Rat [--] and heres the best part, bed bugs, and lots of em, me and my dad were COVERD in bites, like literally covered, we had to throw out souveniers thanks to them, This place was a PURE money scam, bed bugs, rust, mold, sticky dwars in the furnature, all for 150 a night!!!! what a deal!! its cause we threated to contact the health inspectors that they refunded us, im still thinking of doing it. Because when you have bed bugs, its because of lack of cleaning, so obviously the room was NOT CLEAN. if they cleaned often, it wouldnt have been this bad, and even if it wasnt for the bed bugs, this hotel would still be horrible, 2 of the lights in the room worked too, out of the 6...no joke, i no for a fact, that it was not our room only that was infested with bed bugs, it was obviously more rooms, it was so bad that we just had to leave and get a [--] load of calimine medicine. DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL. I signed up to this site JUST to write this. 0 stars'
4,'Gute Lage, teuer','Das Hilton New York haben wir am Ende unserer Transatlantikkreuzfahrt gebucht. Wir wollte nach dem Skyline und dem HI JFK endlich mal ein zentrales Hotel. Dass diese enorm teuer sind, ist klar. Wir haben im TUI-Katalog 2 Nächte für 390 Euro gefunden. Das kostete bei Hilton zu diesem Zeitpunkt 520 Euro. Und das alles ohne Frühstück. Ein Horrorpreis.\r\nWir hatten da noch bei Gullivers einen 200 Euro Gutschein. Mit der Buchungsgebühr vom Mittler haben wir dann 205 Euro gezahlt, das sind knapp über 50 Euro pro Tag und Nase. Ist gerade noch vertretbar.\r\nWir hatten das Hotel schon bei vorhergehenden NYC Aufenthalten gesehen. Ein Monsterkomplex. Die Vorderseite war unten grau-schwarz. Mein erster Eindruck. Das Hotel ist sehr unpersönlich. Der Eindruck verstärkte sich beim Betreten der Lobby immer mehr.\r\nWir konnten um 12 Uhr nicht einchecken. Da standen dann bei der Gepäckabgabe ganz schön viele Leute. Einen Schock bekam ich, wie ich las, dass die Aufbewahrungsgebühr pro Tag 15 Dollar ausmachen sollte. Wir haben dann aber nichts bezahlen müssen. Nicht einmal das sonst obligatorische Trinkgeld.\r\nWir sind dann 3 Stunden ausgegangen. Wir waren am Grealey Square beim KFC. Danach konnten wir nach 15 Uhr einchecken.\r\nDas Zimmer war nichts Herausragendes. So 22m und nicht spektakulär. Der Boden war grau, dazu hatte man gelbe Tapeten gewählt. Die Betten waren durch ein dunkelbraunes Nachtkasterl getrennt. Die Betten waren da doch recht hochgestellt. Das weiße Leintuch war mit einer dunkelblauen Banderole verziert. Der Überwurf war ebenso blau. Ach ja da waren so goldene Blumen drauf.\r\nDer Fernseher war in einem Fernsehschrank mit 3 Schubfächern versteckt. Leider war es noch ein altes Modell. Die Minibar hatte eine Mosaikplatte für den Kaffee- und Teekocher. Der dunkelbraune Schreibtisch hatte eine Tischlampe. Vom schwarzen Bürosessel konnte ich gleich in den Spiegel sehen.\r\nBeim einzigen Fenster war noch ein runder Tisch und ein blaues Fauteuil mit weißen Punkterln.\r\nDas Bad war klein und sehr sauber. Alles war kompakt untergebracht. Der weiße Waschtisch hatte ein schwarzes Top. Leicht abzuwischen, wenig Schmutz zu sehen. Der Wasserhahn hatte zwei Hebel, die sich in die falsche Richtung drehen ließen. Der Thron stand in einem extra ausgeschnittenen Teil des Waschtisches und des Wandspiegels. Die Accessoires stehen in der Wand in einem vertieften Regal. Der Boden war weiß mit schwarzen Sprenkeln.\r\nDer Gang war recht freundlich. Ein blauer Laufer und weiße Wände erinnerte an den Hilton Stil.\r\nVom Frühstück kann ich nicht reden, wir hatten keines dabei und für 25 Dollar pro Person ohne Trinkgeld war uns das zu kostspielig.\r\nDafür haben wir die Lobby noch etwas in Augenschein genommen. Die Bar in Silber sah ja futuristisch aus. An der Decke waren zwei orange Lichtstreifen. Die Bar hatte eine quasi runde silberne Barplatte.\r\nBläuliches Licht sorgte für Stimmung bei den Fauteuils in der Lobby.\r\nWir haben dann nach 2 Tagen ausgecheckt. Es war alles sehr unpersönlich sowie beim Einchecken. Es war zwar alles sauber, aber so eine Massenabfertigung haben wir noch in keinem Hilton gesehen.'
4,'absolutly awesome','This hotel exceeded all of my expectations. Beautiful lobby great restauarants, bars and shopping. Convienent to everything. Rooms are a little small but nothing you cant live with. Water was pretty slow to drain in bathtub but that is the only thing i could complain about. I will stay here again without a second thought.'
1,'OLD - in desperate need of renovation!','UGH. For the price of the hotel, I\'d expect a lot more. Old, funky carpets in halls and rooms. Furniture, worn out. Bathroom VERY small, even the faucets look like they are 100yrs old. The smallest conveniences were missing, no coffee pot, no safe in the room, one bar of soap and a small shampoo/conditioner and $10/day for internet service. I\'d have better accomodations at the Budget Inn. The cafe doesn\'t even compare to other coffee shops across the street. Next time, I\'ll stay somewhere else and use the subway...'
5,'Location, Location, Location!','I just loved this hotel in New York City! Before we left for New York, we heard horror stories about bed bug epidemics, high prices, rude staff, and all the other pitfalls that had befallen our friends on their last trips to the Big Apple. We had none of those problems. The staff was very helpful from check-in through check-out including two very nice concierges. The rooms were clean and spacious. The amenities in the hotel were just what we needed. But most importantly, we walked out of the door to the hustle and bustle of Times Square. I would definetly recommend this hotel, and I can\'t wait to stay there again.'
2,'Close to everything but never again','Stayed here with my husband for 2 nights in June 2011\r\nThis hotel is really situated in an ideal spot, we were able to walk to the shops as well as walk to the water. And there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance.\r\nHotel looks beautiful on the inside and the staff were very helpful and friendly.\r\nAs i had a very tiring journey i arrived early afternoon and asked to be checked into a QUIET room, i went up to the room and did not even manage to lay down for 5 min before you hear the slamming of doors, I then asked to be moved again and this time to an end of corridor room.\r\nI would not say the rooms were that great, i found the bathrooms a bit dated and in some serious need of a proper scrub down with BLEACH. And once again I am sorry to say the walls are paper thin and i could hear the couple next door going at it. So all in all if you are light sleeper or want peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you'
3,Recommend,'This hotel definetly needs a facelift but i\'d still recommend. I stayed on the 16th floor with my sister, with views directly of Macy\'s and the Empire States building from one window and Madison square gardens from the other...Our room was big, admittedly it wasn\'t changed since the last guests left but they quickly dealt with it.The bed was huge, clean and comfortable.... glad I didn\'t know about the bed bugs then! We also had a huge TV and dressing table. It was perfect for our needs and couldnt believe the views! I\'d recommend asking for these sort of qualities at check in....'
3,'Small but stylish','I stayed at the Hudson for a few days and I was amazed at how they were able to cram so much into a little space. I am a petite person and I would highly reccommend that you get a bigger room if you are tall or there are two of you.\r\nI was not impressed by the reception personnel but, the curbside baggage guys were terrific. This definately has a NY vibe but, not sure if I would ever stay here again. I was suprised that when I asked about bottled water right before going to bed they suggested I get some at the bar on the first floor. Perhaps the cool thing to do would be to bring my own water from outside. Wifi from my room was okay.'
1,'Disgusting beyond belief','Stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania. I was so disappointed. After saving for a vacation, looking at the hotel pictures of a nice hotel, it was beyond belief that this place is open to the public.\r\nI have never stayed in a place so dirty. The paint is falling off the walls. The lights had no light bulbs. The furniture was broken and missing drawers. The hotel smelled of cigarette smoke everywhere. I did not even dare walk barefoot in the room. I am so disappointed that this hotel uses its nice lobby to lure people in. I felt like I had stepped into a horror movie.'
5,'Outstanding Hotel','This downtown Chicago hotel is absolutely terrific. Upon pulling up to the hotel guests are greeted by hotel staff. Luggage is then taken away while the guest checks in. We, being gold members, received a free upgrade to the executive lounge and a 2 bathroom suite. The executive lounge was a great addition. Free soda, coffee, and light snacks all day and a larger variety (wings, noodles, etc.) from 5-7. The hotel is perfect for families as it is in the center of downtown (within walking distance from nearly everything.) The pool was small (typical of Chicago) yet very nice. I wish I had more time at the hotel. The old-fashioned charm and extremely friendly staff are what makes this hotel so very special.'
1,'cockroaches, poor staff service, tiny rooms = not returning','I was impressed by the lobby, but thats about all I was impressed with. Our room was quite small, hardly any room for luggage and my sister who stayed the whole week had an even smaller room! It just about fit the bed and a desk and thats it! literally no room what-so-ever to walk in or to hold luggage! the bathroom doors wouldnt lock properly in either rooms. And TWO cockroaches were found in our room, which is definitly not a good sign for cleanliness! The diner was alright, the food was average, the coffee tasted of water and the staff were quite intimidating and abrupt! The check out time was at about 11am, which was fine, but someone opened our door at about 6am in the morning, good thing i put the dead bolt on!\r\nStaff behind the front desk were standing in small groups talking to eachother while i, along with other guests waited! \r\nDefinitely will not be returning to this hotel!'
5,'Excellent Hotel and great value','I stayed at this hotel last week for the remaining 3 nights of my trip to NY beacsue the original hotel booked was awful we had to move.\r\nI found the hotel staff very helpful and I was upgraded free of charge to a more superior room, the room was much larger than expected, clean and very comfortable. A couple of friends had stayed here previosuly and had said it was great value and clean, they were not happy with the first room they were given, complained and were given a much bigger room.\r\nI think the higher up you go in this hotel the better the rooms, I was on floor 13 out of about 18.\r\nFor the money it\'s a great place to stay and somwhere you\'d take your parents, friends or partner.\r\nI\'d definitely book this hotel again and not bother researching others, what you see on their website (photos etc) is exactly what you get.'
4,'Poor poor reception staff','Rooms could do with a update looking a little jaded, We had a meal in the revolving restuarant the staff, the food exceptional we were treat like royalty, The location of the hotel is just perfect, The bad part of our stay was being locked out of our room and were treated like criminal at the front desk, It was there mistake but WE were treated terrible .\r\nOverhaul I suppose I would stay again but would look around at other hotels before I booked again'
5,'Muy buen hotel en un sitio perfecto!!!!','Hola, pasamos dos noches en mayo de 2012, y la experiencia fue muy buena. La ubicación aunque no hace falta decirlo, es perfecta. Está todo a mano. Yo pensaba que iba a ser un poco agobiante estar en pleno Times Square, pero no, es genial, porque puedes ir andando a cualquier sitio y en cualquier momento puedes subir al hotel a dejar cualquier cosa. \r\nSobre la habitación elegimos una estándar con vistas a times square. Fue muy buena elección porque las vistas de noche desde la habitación son increíbles, es una panorámica de times square que no puedes conseguir en ningún otro sitio. Es genial. La habitación era de buen tamaño. Es cierto que quizás tiene ya unos añitos el hotel y eso se nota, pero la habitación me pareció super agradable. La cama súper cómoda y todo perfectamente limpio. \r\nEl personal del hotel fue muy amable. No tuvimos demasiado trato, pero tanto a la llegada como al irnos fueron de lo más amables.\r\nSobre el desayuno, merece la pena pagarlo. Tanto por la calidad del desayuno, que es muy variado y completo, como por las vistas a Times Square. El restaurante hace esquina mirando a Times Square lo que lo convierte en un sitio ideal para pasar el primer rato de la mañana. \r\nEs cierto que el hotel no es excesivamente barato, pero merece la pena y si encuentras alguna oferta pues mucho mejor. \r\nEn resumen, que recomiendo totalmente el hotel, por su ubicación, instalaciones y atención del personal. Sin duda volvería a este hotel si vuelvo a Nueva York (que espero que así sea :-))'
5,'Absolutely loved Affinia Manhattan','We had such a wonderful stay at Affinia Manhattan. We had an overnight flight from San Francisco with 3 young kids and even though we weren\'t supposed to check in until the afternoon, they let us check in at 9.30am for much needed sleep. Thank you so much Affinia Manhattan! \r\nWe loved the rooms - there were 2 bathrooms, plenty of room for the 5 of us and a kitchen to cook some food - we were over take out. \r\nIt is so centrally located. Easy to navigate the city from Penn Station across the road. \r\nDidn\'t hear the fire trucks at night but asked to stay on a higher floor. \r\nWill be recommending the Affinia Manhattan to all our family and friends.'
1,Decepcionante,'No hagais caso de la valoracion de su web, este hotel no se merece mas de dos estrellas. Solo tiene de bueno un gran hall y que esta muy centrico (con el metro en la misma esquina del hotel). El hotel necesita una renovacion ENTERA, esta muy mal mantenido; las puertas, los ascensores, las luces, la moqueta, los baños,los armarios. Y sobre todo, sobre todo: que no os den una habitacion que de al patio interior: exigid una habitacion exterior.'
5,'Christmas in the New York','My daughters, boyfriend and I just spent a wonderful time in the city and Park Central was a key part. I had explained that we needed separate sleeping quarters and we were given a wonderful ,spacious concierge suite. My girls had a pull out sofa overlooking Times Square and a flat screen TV. Gladly to admit, they spent most of the time when we were in the room watching the city! Park Central is walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Radio City music hall, FAO Schwartz and Times Square. Elizabeth at the front desk was so helpful and accommodating to us. She even arranged for a late check out so we could go ice skating in Central Park. I have stayed twice at this hotel, once in the summer and now once in the winter and both of our trips have been a memorable time, we will return to Park Central as guests!'
3,'Great location, efficient & comfortable but lacks personality','Hilton New York is an efficient guest-factory in a great location. WIFI starts at U$ 14,95 per day, but is free if you pass on the housekeeping service, but with the unsophisticated WIFI access code gogreen everybody can use this amenity and still enjoy housekeeping. Stay was good and unevenfull. Having to pay for luggage storage after paying the hotel U$ 1400 for a 3 night stay, room only was an unpleasant surprise. This is what you can expect in a factory like hotel where money is welcomed warmer than guests..'
5,'Exceeded our expectations!','My husband and I have stayed at many hotels in Manhattan. This was our first stay at The New Yorker and it was a fabulous experience. The Art Deco decor, comfortable room, central location and rich history all combined to make this a wonderful hotel.\r\nThe price was more than reasonable. We would return to this hotel without hesitation.\r\nA special thanks goes to the extremely nice and helpful desk clerk named Mohammed!'

3,'Great Location','Stayed at the Edison for 5 nights in September. The hotel is old and small especially the bathroom. Apart from that I really didn\'t have any complaints re: the Edison. No problems with staff and had an easy check in/check out. You can\'t beat the location. You\'re right in the middle of Times Square as soon as you walk out. There\'s also a laundry place on the next block which comes in handy. Our room was on the eight floor. You could still hear the noise from the streets but that\'s expected. It is New York. \r\nBooked through HotelConxions.com which was a lot cheaper than other web sites. \r\nOverall, I found the Edison sufficient for my stay. It was clean and the location can\'t be beat. I\'m sure it\'s a lot cheaper to stay at the Edison than the other hotels nearby.'
5,'Amazing service','stayed there for my 22nd anniversary the reception especially the agent Vanessa did everything to make our stay memorable.\r\nI am a Gold member and I LOVE to stay with the Crowne Plaza they are always a home away from home for me.'
2,'Once Bitten.....Twice Shy','Stayed at the New Yorker, June 2011 for 10 nights, Service was ok, didn\'t like the fact that i had to leave $300 at reception on checking in, got it back when we checked out though.\r\nThe room was way too small, couldnt swing a cat in there, our view were other rooms windows and the t.v channels are the worst ive ever experienced, I\'m no novice to NY and have stayed in cheaper hotels and got more channels to watch, Tick Tock Diner is way over priced.\r\nI was bitten twice on my ankles while in bed, wasn\'t impressed, I would say the ONLY good point is the Location is perfect, Plus there are way too much bums in that area begging, overall if i was to return, I would think twice in staying here!!!!!!'
4,'like having our own apartment, with housekeeping','Location is excellent, just across from Penn station.\r\nService, everyone very friendly\r\nRoom, excellent, 2 double beds in room with on-suite and storage, sitting room and kitchen. full 2nd bathroom\r\nPrice, booked online very reasonable'
4,'A very good hotel in a great location','The hotel definitely needs updating but it\'s solid by NYC standards. It has a great gym and a great breakfast buffet if you\'re on one of the club floors.'
5,'Probably the best budget hotel rooms in NYC!','Myself and two friends stayed here for four nights and the hotel was perfect. we had a room with a kitchen (inc fridge, oven, microwave, toaster, coffee machine (no kettle but we boiled water on the hob for our tea), sofabed, tv, we had another tv in the bedroom with two big comfy beds and if that wasn\'t good enough we had TWO bathrooms!\r\nWe had breakfast every morning at the Bagel Mavern right across the street! Then we could walk straight Penn Station and the subway as they were right up the street.There are plenty of restaurants/take-aways/grocery stores within one block of the hotel! \r\nThe area was quite noisy at night but what do you expect in the centre of New York??? Nothing earplugs wont fix! \r\nThe concierge were really helpful and recommended restaurants to visit and booked us reservations and we couldn\'t fault the food!\r\nI highly recommend renting a bike and cycling around the Central Park 6mile loop - it was a beautiful way to see it! \r\nAll in all this hotel was great with good sized, clean rooms and helpful staff - we had no problems and would defintely stay here again!'
1,'Could have been much better for the price','Ok so we were a block from Time Square!! but for the price the hotel and room weren\'t great at all. We paid around $150 a night from Dec 12-15 for our wedding anniversary. Hotel was very deco style. Found the staff to not very friendly. Our room was very decent size but bathroom was a huge problem. So after using the shower the faucet decided to drip none stop. Called maintenance and they said they were in the process of renovating rooms and they hadn\'t gotten to ours yet. They tightened the facuet but it still dripped. It sucked! They were very unwilling to help. And not make matters worse we had a room right by the elevators which were noisey. Luckly we had some sandwiches bags and rigged up a way to stop the dripping and had cotton balls to put in our ears. I would not stay here again. Food was NOT good at the hotel restauratnt either and staff was not friendly. Also don\'t be afraid to ride the subway at night. We rode it at midnight and not afraid at all. Thats why we stayed at Times Square cause we read so much that said don\'t ride the subway at night. So not true!!!'
4,'Nice rooms, terrible room service, location is super touristy','I recently stayed at the Westin in Times Square for an evening while I was in town on business. I visit NY often (sometimes 2-3 times a month) and usually stay at another hotel. Since it was sold out, I chose the Westin. I had a good stay overall. The rooms are very nice and appear to be recently remodeled. It\'s a huge hotel, but never felt overcrowded. Often at the big NY hotels you have to wait forever to check in and for the elevator to come. This certainly wasn\'t the case at this hotel. \r\nMy only complaints are the room service and that the location is very touristy. Ok if you\'re there for a vacation I suppose, but it was a bit too much for me as a business traveller. I did order room service for dinner (not wanting to fight the scads of tourists to find a restaurant) and was disappointed. My steak was overcooked and didn\'t come with a steak knife and the rolls that I requested were hard as bricks. I called back immediately to get a knife and fresh bread, but they never arrived. 45 minutes later I called back to cancel the knife and bread (as I\'d already muddled through with my butter knife and finished the meal.) They said they\'d see what they could do and never called me back. The next day though, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they credited back the full amount of the meal. \r\nOverall - a nice hotel and much better than most of the big NY establishments. I\'d stay here again in a pinch, but next time it\'s back to my usual place!'
4,'Best Location in NYC!','The Marquis is a great location to stay with family. \r\nBroadway and the proximity of the Subway make it very easy to get around. It\'s also worth mentioning that over the past 3 years Marriott has been investing money in refurbishing all the rooms and the interior of the hotel. \r\nWe had a great week and we will definitely be back!'
4,'Quality hotel in an amazing location!','We are a family of four holidaying here for 6 nights mid December 2011 in a Times Square View Room. The location of this hotel is amazing - right at the heart of everything in New York, with Times Square just at the doorstep. Across the road from M&M World, next door to Hersheys with both McDonalds and Tkts within a small block. The room had fantastic views over Times Square with surprisingly little noise, we were on 40th floor. The room was tiny as are all rooms in Manhattan, however very clean and comfortable beds. The breakfast buffet was a magnificent feast with great views. The staff were all very helpful, friendly and professional.'
5,'Very good','We were travelling in the east coast for 2,5 weeks with my family (parents + 2 adult children) and chose Hotel New Yorker as our base for exploring New York city. We were very pleasantly surprised to find out that our room was on the 34th floor with amazing views towards Empire State Buidling and other skyscrapers. We had a small suite which could nicely fit our family of four. The room was clean and very quiet which provided a good sleep. Our room included breakfast which was served on the 39th floor with even better views of downtown New York. Very good experience!'
5,'THE BEST.','It was ny first time in NY and i was travelling alone. my flight to NY got delayed and my baggage got lost!!! They said this is normal in NY. Thank God for Affinia\'s staff, they really made my stay pleasant despite the fact i do not have my baggage! they provided me with everything I may need (well except clothes of course). I will never forget this hotel and will definitely come back!'
3,'Westin Times Sq Review','Stayed this hotel 3 times in 2011 the most recent in September . The location is excellent and generally the hotel is comfortable . It is let down by its service culture which is evident the moment you walk in . There are many bell hops on the ground floor who totally ignore arriving guests , leaving them to struggle with one or more bags up escalators . The front desk is a disappointment . The afternoon staff at peak hour make you feel like you are ruining their day by wanting to check in . Staff in the bar at the rear of the elevators are non existent after 11pm yet it is advertised to stay open till 12.30am. The rooms are pleasant but housekeeping continually leaves things out , glasses , towels ,laundry forms, shampoo etc small things , but all add up . I requested a laundry form and bag on four consecutive mornings and never received one until it was too late to have anything washed \r\nRoom sevice takes forever or sometimes never arrives without a call prompting . I indicated this on several TNS surveys but I never received any replies and the conditions still existed on subsequent trips . There is a distinct lack of any kind of service ethic or culture in this place and it seems to permeate from the top . I mentioned I wished to complain to the duty manager and never got a call back . With attention to detail and a greater service culture this could be a great hotel , but in the meantime I suspect there are better options.'
5,'Fab Hotel for Shopping, Leisure and Pleasure!','Dec 09 Shopping Trip with Mum- we\'ve been fortunate enough to do this in Dec for the past few years. A lot of New York Hotels are \'boutique\' type- where you couldn\'t swing a cat in the bedroom because it\'s so small and cramped....Not so the Westin Times Square!!\r\nRoom 4008 (40th floor) gave an amazing panormaic view of the Hudson River, buildings, skylines, and 8th Avenue below. It was a spacious deluxe double room with a stylish en suite- in immaculate condition- with an LCD TV and wi-fi access, etc. \r\nThe lifts were super-fast, delivering you to the 1st floor reception with exit via the theatre on 42nd street or hotel lobby on 43rd street. Bar 10 and Shula\'s restaurant complement the facilities. A 39th floor gym is also available with a $10 daily charge\r\nThe central Times Square location was amazing with the Port Authority transport station a stone\'s throw away. \r\nThis 4 star hotel comes with an accompanying price- tag but, having experienced cramped rooms in the Paramount, etc., it was well worth the money for an annual holiday experience that memories are made of......!\r\nStaff were very friendly with top class customer service!'
5,'Our Affinity with the Affinia','I travelled to New York to meet my daughter. The Affinia Manhattan will hold a very special place in my memories. Upon arrival I was anxious to call my family at home in Sydney and after a 22 hour flight I was a bit frazzled to say the least. Michael Santos, Manager, was understanding, helpful and comforting. I called him my guardian angel, nothing was too much to ask, from him and his marvelous staff. I stayed in NYC for 10 days with my daughter and we were always greeted with a smile and a eagerness to help from all of the staff. The hotel is quite pretty, excellent location, close to everything and we felt very safe there. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Considering the busy and central location of the hotel, I would not say that it was unreasonably noisy. I would stay there again, when I return to NYC and I would recommend this lovely hotel to anyone with confidence. Thank you again Michael to you and your excellent staff for our stay in NYC. We had an amazing time and will always have such wonderful memories of the Affinia. See you again soon.'

3,Meh.,'The New Yorker needs to kick it up a notch. They have a great foundation with some killer art deco architectural elements, a great location across from Penn Station and an attached restaurant and 24 hour diner, but the decor was cheap and everything needed a fresh coat of paint. \r\nAs guests enter the lobby, you can see this must have been an amazing space back in the day, but it is void of decoration and key design elements. A large hotel lobby circular couch would make a world of difference and add some flow to the room. The walls are begging for a bas relief or posters from the 30s or well... ...anything! \r\nThe room was small, poorly lit and the tv was crammed over in a corner. The bed was comfortable. The wireless was pitifully slow and there was no free wireless in the lobby. The bathroom had peeling paint and it was too small to move around. The shower had two hot and cold faucets and I could not get a consistent comfortable temperature. \r\nI would not recommend the Tick Tock Diner and I would strongly caution against Cooper\'s Tavern. The caesar salad was okay, but I was served an undrinkable glass of Malbec that was sharp and acidic. There was also a real funky smell in the bar and the bartenders were inattentive or rude. \r\nWhen we met friends in the Village for dinner and told them where we were staying they grimaced and that about sums it up. Spend a little more and stay elsewhere.'
3,'Convenient if ugly location - historic interior','Convenient to the museum, symphony and restaurants. Great Russian nearby. Street level is ugly with the elevated train nearby. The lobby is grand. Stayed in a historic looking room with 2 bathrooms. Crowded executive lounge.'

5,'Hotel pefetto, personale perfetto,','Per prima cosa, posizionamente perfetto, tra central park e time square, metropolitana passa giusto sotto l\'albergo, personale perfetto, molto gentile e cordiale, figuratevi che ho già prenotato anche per quest\'anno, visto che andro a san francisco farò una tappa a N.Y., sicuramente è un hotel da prendere in cosiderazione senza nesun dubbio.'
4,'July 8 - 11th Great stay, loved it!','We stayed for 3 nights. I was really nervous about the type of room we would get since we booked through Priceline and sounds like some people have ended up with closet-sized rooms after booking through Priceline. We called a few days ahead of time and requested a non-smoking room with 2 beds. Of course they couldn\'t promise, but noted it on the reservation. My husband was in town ahead of me and checked in at 11:30 am and they wanted to charge him $25.00 for early checkin. He went to the Hilton Honors desk and she agreed to waive it this one time (since he had booked through Priceline apparently he didn\'t qualify for regular Hilton Honors benefits). He was given a huge corner room on the 13th floor, nonsmoking, with 2 double beds, a sofa, and desk. It was a little close to the El so too noisy, so he requested to be moved further away from the El. He was given another large room on the 14th floor. The room was non-smoking, had 2 double beds, a chair and ottoman, desk, dresser and 2 closets. Yes the bathroom was small, but not unbearably. small. We could still hear the El, but not as bad as the first room. Other than the El, the room was very quiet. They have several banks of elevators for different floors so we never had to wait long for an elevator. No coffee maker in the room but the Starbucks was right at the bottom of the elevator so quite convenient. We did have to pay for wireless which I think was around $20/night - pretty expensive. But considering we only paid $80 for the room, we still had a great rate overall. Everyone was really nice, hotel is gorgeous. The room was renovated and very attractive. The beds were super comfortable. Hotel is in great location, no car needed. Easy access to El, plenty of cabs, and lots of sights within walking distance. I would be happy to stay here again.'
5,'Excellent hotel','Arrived back from spending 6 nights at the hotel. I was traveling with my 14 year old daughter. We paid to upgrade to a view room and were delighted that were allocated a large corner room with a wonderful view of the Empire state building. We found the hotel very comfortable and clean. Were disappointed that couldn\'t get in to have breakfast at the tick tock diner one morning (we were a group of 6 but the communication from the head waiter to seat us wasn\'t brilliant) however had been happy with the tick tock when they delivered room service on the first night and my daugter and i ate there on another evening. The area in the lobbly selling coffee/ muffins etc for breakfast was very good and it was nice to be able to sit in lobby and eat this if we wanted a quick breakfast option. The hotel was also in a briliant location to see manhattan. We walked to times square frequently and it was about 10 mins. It always felt very safe walking back even at night. The hotel was also ideally situated to explore the southern sites (liberty island, Ellis, china town etc). Overall an excellent break really helped by a very efficient and clean hotel.'
4,'Centralissimo e pulitissimo','Hotel in zona fin troppo centrale, quindi in mezzo al caos di Times Square.\r\nLa nostra camera fortunatamente era ad un piano altissimo e non siamo stati disturbati da rumori durante la notte. Stanza quadrupla un pò piccola ma letto molto confortevole e bagno pulitissimo.\r\nPer un piccolo disguido il managment dell\'hotel si è subito adoperato per noi e ci hanno offerto la colazione.. semplicemente strepitosa, con mille possibilità, bevande di ogni tipo, cereali, dolci, succhi di frutta, uova, toast, pancetta, salsicce, pane, burro, marmellate di tutti i tipi, davvero buonissima!'
5,'Love this hotel!','We travel to NYC once a year and always stay at the Marquis. The location is incredible - right in Times Square - and the room amenities are great. For a NYC hotel room, the rooms are a good size. The beds are the most comfortable bed of any hotel I have ever stayed in. The elevators are fast and you don\'t wait a long time, especially given the number of floors and people. We will continue to stay here!'
4,'Perfect location, nice ambiance','We stayed in the Edison the week after Easter, adn it was really nice. Sure, the bedrooms and the corridors are somewhat dated, and in need of a revamp, but as far as I know they\'re working on it bit by bit. The public part of the hotel is lovely, very swish 20\'s style decor, with appropriate music playing in the background. Literally a minute from Times Square, but quiet enough, given that fact. Of course, it\'s never totally quiet in NY, but for the location, it was fine. We didn\'t eat in the hotel, although the two restaurants looked nice. Like other reviewers, we breakfasted in Danny\'s Deli next door, which was brilliantly priced for the location.\r\nI would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to stay at the centre of things in New York.'
5,'Wow. Das ist gelebte Hotelgeschichte','Ziemlich klar ist, dass Paris Hilton eine Dumpfbacke ist. Und man kann verstehen, wenn jemand wegen der Dame gleich den ganzen Familienbetrieb meidet. Wer allerdings derart zum Hilton-Hasser mutiert, verpasst mit dem Palmer House in Chicago ein wirklich denkwürdiges, eindrucksvoll schönes und überwältigend historisches Hotel. Das Haus entstand im 19. Jahrhundert. Bau und ursprüngliche Architektur sind auf den Fluren in den Hoteletagen bildlich dokumentiert, lohnt sich, dort entlang zu bummeln. Wichtiger ist aber, dass die großen Hallen und legendären Restauranträume in Bestzustand erhalten sind. Atemberaubend, wenn man sich vom Eingang die Treppen in Richtung Rezeption hochgearbeitet hat und plötzlich mitten in den gewaltigen, mit sandfarbenem Marmopr ausgekleideten Main Hall steht, wo einst natürlich auch Onkel Al C. schon stand. Dutzende Rezeptionisten checken die Kunden ein, was bei der Größe des Hauses nötig ist. Perfekt funktioniert die amerikanische Idee des automatischen Checkouts: in der Nacht vor der Abreise schließt Hilton die Rechnung und laßt sie aufs Zimmer liefern. Zugleich autorisiert man den Rechnungsbetrag über die Kreditkarte. Für den Gast bedeutet das einen enormen Zeitgewinn, denn man muß nicht nach der Rechnung anstehen. Das Frühstück schlägt vieles und ist reiner Luxus: Alles Warme wird frisch zubereitet. Das Buffett ist grenzenlos. Allerdings kann das Frühstücksrestaurant bei hohem Andrang überfüllt sein, da braucht man dann Geduld. Die Zimmer sind klassisch-amerikanisch, sauber und (vor allem die Bäder) nicht auf dem letzten Stand der Technik. Daran arbeitet das Haus, die Zimmer werden derzeit durchgängig renoviert. Die Betten - man muß es betonen - aber sind absolute Sonderklasse, ebenso das gesamte Bettzeug und die Bettwäsche. Das Haus liegt optimal in U-Ban-Nähe (eigentlich mitten im Loop), in Walking-Distance zur Golden Mile, drei Minuten zum Millenium Park, zur Cloud und zum Seeufer. In anderen Worten: besser geht es kaum. Leisten Sie sich was, und vergessen Sie Paris Hilton - die wird nie den Stil haben, den dieses Haus hat.'
5,'Great Hotel, Great Location','All right, I am a bit prejudiced here. First time I have been here for a while, but it has always been one of my favorite hotels and certainly my preferred hotel and location in New York. Intimate and cosy it is not - this is a big international hotel set up to deal with the masses and the hustle and bustle of Times Square is either to your liking or not.\r\nI have always liked the atrium which goes up 30 floors or so from reception. The lifts only take a few seconds for the trip and the glass bubble ones are better than most fairground rides but not, I suspect, if you suffer from vertigo. When I used to come you could wait half an hour for a lift, but they seem to have sorted that out with a new computerised routing system. The galleries around each floor used to be open, but have rather been spoiled by the addition of metal guards - this was apparently necessary after three people jumped in the space of 20 months which must have upset the diners at the bottom somewhat.\r\nThere is a revolving restaurant up top which is great for Sunday brunch. Apart from that there is no shortage of venues to eat and drink in both inside and out of the hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with large safes. No robe, slippers or mini bar though which seems odd. $16.95 a day for the internet is over the top.\r\nNot a cheap hotel, but if you can get a deal I would recommend the experience.'
2,'senza parole......','Vale per il prezzo che si paga.........poca pulizia e la hall sembra la stazione termini. Di positivo c\'è solo la posizione centrale a NY ma se dovessi tornare nella grande mela lo eviterei. Buono per chi vuole spendere poco per girare tutto il giorno e tornarci solo per dormire.'
4,'Convenient to everything!','Took a family trip for Mother\'s Day to NYC. Parked the car up the river to avoid expensive parking in NYC. The Grand Hyatt was on the Hudson train line at Grand Central Station. So easy! Walking distance to Times Square, ROC Center etc. Rooms were updated, very clean and ultra modern bathrooms. Staff was very accomodating and quickly provided an addition bed for grandchild. Room rates were very affordable for Midtown. The ease of travelling throughout NYC was the greatest draw. Perched right atop Grand Central with easy connections everywhere. Next door to Chrysler building and many restaurants, including Oyster Bar at GCS. Would highly recommend.'
2,'Location, location, location','Having read various reviews I almost cancelled the booking over Thanksgiving, but discovered no where else could match the price and went ahead. The hotel is large, there is constant movement of people checking in and out, waiting in the lobby and using the elevators. The hotel is old and there is no doubt that it could do with paint as the walls are scuffed. However, the room allocated was a good size, the bed was comfortable and the sheets changed daily, the bathroom was clean, there was plenty of hot water and towels changed daily. Sure, it could do with a makeover, but it would be very hard to beat the location and the price is good. The staff at the front desk were very efficient and cheerful.'
2,'Hated it...','Just returned from N.Y. We were allocated in room 1634, a room which had not been renovated, the staff were unwelcoming and not that helpful at all. The hotel needs a complete referb. The only thing going for it is the location. I would sum the hotel up as being cheap and cheerless.......Never again'
5,'Unmatched Hospitality','After a long day and dealing with NYC traffic, we arrived at the Crowne Plaza Times Square where we were met by Evelyn. What a wonderful reception. She immediately made us feel welcome and right at home. Put us up in a fantastic room overlooking Times Square and welcomed us with a complimentary beverage. Furthermore, when they found out we were celebrating our anniversary, we were presented with a gift basket! What a great place! Evelyn made our stay super special. Thank you Evelyn! This is an incredible hotel. Strongly recommend it!'
3,'Takes some getting used to','Spent Spring Break at the Hudson with our 3 kids; the standard Queen at $145/nite was small and cramped, but comfortable; for the 3 kids, they offered us a $90 upgrade to a large comfortable corner room. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The hotel does not have much to offer in terms of dining or healthclub facilities. Got our exercise walking around Manhattan! If your looking for a clean place to sack out, and spend the rest of your day outdoors, at a decent price, I\'d recommend the Hudson. Its tiny facility should make the Brits feel right at home...size comparable to 3-4 star lodging in London!'
5,'Great staff and Service, Excellent Value','My fiancee and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and decided to book a hotel room in the city and the Crowne Palaza looked like a good choice. Upon checking in we were greeted by the Lobby Manager Leo and he asked what brought us to the hotel that day. We explained that it was our 5 year anniversary and we wanted to just relax and enjoy our evening. He congratulated us and sent up a bottle of champaign to our room - this made our night! The room was beautiful and the view was terrific! I would absolutely go back!'
4,'mega hotel','uno de los mas grande hotel de New York, el trato es un poco impersonal, pero pasa, su restaurante giratorio es deslumbrante sea de dia o de noche, pero el costo cuantidad precio no es de lo mejor, mejor comer afuera se eres goloso jejejejeje. no tiene internet gratis en las habitaciones, pero estas son inmensa limpia , las camas son super confortable.'
4,'Pleasant stay, but expected more...','Recently stayed with my mom, aunt and brother in a two double bed suite. Though the view was terrific (directly above Times Square!), I was not impressed by the size of the room, especially since they called it a suite (seriously, what made it a suite?). \r\nHad good dealings with the staff, doormen/bagboys/valet were all very courteous, and the front desk was friendly and helpful with I requested a late check out and when I had a dispute with a charge on the bill. Was very surprised and disappointed at the lack of free WiFi and the $17/day charge for in-room internet. Also no mini-fridge and no microwave in room.\r\nOver all, very pleasant stay but expected more for the price and the reputation...'
4,'Fint hotel','Ramada New Yoker er et lidt ældre meget ikonisk hotel med 37 etager. Værelserne er ikke for store med hyggelige og fornuftige. Hotellets service er effektiv og venlig og der er check på hvem der kommer ind og ud. Meget tilfreds med opholdet, der varede en uge og vi befandt os på 25. etage med direkte udsigt til Empire State.'
5,'Second time around - still very happy with this hotel','We arrived in the morning and our check in was at 4 pm. Although we waited to check in by 4, the front desk associate was extremely kind to us. We were in a party of four and he was able to assign two rooms by each other. You can\'t beat this location. We walked every night to times square and never had to fight for a cab. The concierge was very helpful. Our overall experience was very positive.'
5,'Hilton New York @ Av. of the Americas was amazing!','My best friend and I stayed at the Hilton Club located on floors 34 and 35 of\r\nthe Hilton New York... Everything I say is to be understated because this hotel\r\nis great!!! \r\nWe both visit NY frequently, at least once a year, and it has been, by far, the\r\nbest place...\r\nThe room was huge!!! and by NY standards even bigger!!! the bathroom was like a\r\nroom by itself. With a shower and a huge tub. \r\nThe service was amazing also. \r\nThey serve breakfast and cocktails and the food was delicious. \r\nCheckout was easy and efficient and I didn\'t have to pay for the internet\r\nservice. \r\nBesides, the location is amazing!!! great shops and museums just 1 or 2 blocks\r\naway!!!\r\nDon’t forget to visit the really famous Arab food stall right on the corner...\r\ndelicious!\r\nL!'
4,'Location and View!!!','First let me tell you that we did not pay for the room we went as a work trip for my husband. \r\nSecondly the location was amazing, from our room window we could see times square, it was beautiful. When you left the hotel you are the center of it. walking distance to most sights and subway is very close. \r\nThe room its self was ok nothing special but it was mostly the view and the location that would make me stay there again. \r\nStaff was very nice.\r\nthe elevator is amazing too.'
5,'Great hotel with central location!','Wonderful staff. Got a free upgrade to a spa-inspired room. Decent size rooms-very clean and nice bathrooms. Loved the beds-were wonderful to get into after a long tiring day. Massaging chair in the room did a great job in relaxing sore muscles! \r\nWe had an amazing time there. Would recommend this place to everyone!'

1,'Beware! They tried to throw us out because they couldn\'t read account.','We had a very unpleasant 3 days of a 6 day stay and have lodged a major complaint. Beds were quiet and comfy, location is central to good food and sights. Safety, noise and acess were issues for first 2 days.- tiles up in shower and loose entry carpet. Then upgrade was better for our mobility issues. Avoid the hotel bistro. Last 3 days were punctuated by very in your face discussions with the reception about our incorrectly calculated account. (They wanted to charge us twice and then throw us out at 8pm on Saturday night.) Problems continued 3 days. Reception and Concierge were worst I have experienced in my life. Other service staff - doormen, housekeeping and the rest of NYC were good, our sanity. Cheap deal went sour.'
5,'Super Hotel in zentraler Lage!','Das Preisleistungsverhältnis stimmt, alle Zimmer sind frisch renoviert - die Innenausstattung der Zimmer schafft ein angenehmes Ambiente. Mehrere U-Bahnstationen befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nähe (2 Gehminuten) und der Times Square ist nur ca. 15 Gehminuten entfernt. Zu Fuß erreicht man das nahegelegene Emppire State Building ebenso, wie den Central Park, das Rockefeller Center, das Chrysler Building, die Grand Central Station und auch ein großer Busbahnfof für die Strecke zum Flughafen oder in andere Städte ist quasi um die Ecke. Alles in allem auf jeden Fall zum Weiterempfehlen und ich werde bei meinem nächsten New-York-Trip gerne wieder dieses Hotel wählen!'
4,'Mob-luxury, but outdated service too!','This hotel is perfect stopping off point for walking around Chicago and visiting many of the most famous sights. They are all within shouting distance of the main entrance. I booked through Priceline and they accepted just $76 per night - usual rate $199, so no complaints there. The rooms are luxurious looking, but the fixtures and fitting are all very old. There\'s a Starbucks in the lobby so no coffee/tea facilities in the room. If you can get it through Priceline for something like I paid for it it is perfect, but their standard price would be far too much!'
5,'Loved Chicago','Chicago is a clean, exciting, trendy city...but most of all I felt like I was safe too!!\r\nLots to do from lots of museums to discover to shops to spend your money in or keep it cheap and check out the parks and have a picnic by a fountain...what ever your budget gooo gooo gooo!'
3,'Superb location -- Full of European charter bus folks and tired furnishings','This is probably one of the best central locations in NYC. You can walk out the front door and be in Times Square in one minute. This property is owned by an Eastern European (Polish family, I believe) and is one of the few remaining family-owned properties in NYC. I expect one of the big chains will purchase it in time.\r\nDue to the Eastern European influence, the hotel attracts loads of Europeans. The hotel is Art Deco and built in the 1920\'s or 30\'s. There is always renovation going on and, if you\'re very lucky, will get a newly-renovated room. If not, you will get something that looks tired and dated. Even with the renovations, the bathrooms still look old and they did nothing to them. The tile grout in the floor and shower is often dirty and moldy.\r\nIf you plan on doing nothing but using this as a staging area, it\'s a great price. If you\'re looking for luxury and location, find another hotel. It was seen in one episode of Seinfeld and many theatre producers, writers, NYC, and locals frequent the downstairs cafe. \r\nJust don\'t get on a floor where the charter folks are or you will never get sleep. We have had a mouse in our room on two occasions in the last six years. We have not seen roaches, but have heard recent tales of bed bugs from others. It\'s always a good idea to check mattresses and headboards for bb signs before unpacking your bags. You might need to change rooms if there is an infestation.\r\nOutside noise goes 24 hours. You are in the heart of NYC with ambulances, fire trucks, police sirens, garbage trucks, etc. Learn to live with it and you will be fine. Not a cookie cutter hotel as all rooms have different configurations.'
5,'I absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone!','My partner and I stayed here from February 2nd to February 5th and we adored our stay at the Affinia Manhattan. The Location Is Perfect! You are literally a 5 - 6 minute walk from the hustle of Times Square in addition to being just around the corner from Macys (Which had a sale on!) and of course, minutes from the Empire State Building.\r\nThe concierge are really helpful and any questions that we had were answered and they were really helpful with buying metro tickets and finding our way to the Brooklyn Bridge for some photos.\r\nWe didn\'t have dinner in Niles restaurant but had lots and lots of cocktails in the bar which is a really busy vibrant bar in the evening.\r\nAll in All.....I would definitely come back to this hotel.\r\nJimmy\r\nLondon UK'
3,'If you like to be pampered...','stay somewhere else! I stayed here with several friends over a weekend. The check in process was a nightmare. They would not permit me to check in despite having a confirmation with my name on it! My friend made the reservation and requested that my name be added to the reservation. Despite having written confirmation, my name evidently did not appear on the screen that the vapid reception clerk saw. Later, when the rest of the party arrived to check in, we were told that our request for adjoining rooms which had been confirmed would not be possible and we would have to have a king bed, rather than two doubles and a cot for the room. We agreed to this and then they made us change rooms after one night! The first room had an inoperable telephone, no remote, no towels, no robe, etc. It was like pulling teeth to get any kind of service out of the staff. The room appeared worn and the cold black slate flooring was not appealing. The crappy metalic stand in the bathroom for amenities missed the mark on an attempt to appear trendy and practical. For the price of the room at this hotel, I would much rather stay somewhere else next time, but in the same vicinity.'
2,'more like a bus station','staff had no idea of what rooms they had..asked for a room with two beds,told that they did not exist in the hotel.then room got change to a room with two beds??? no bath robes ,no glasses all had to be asked for.. the entrance an interior is more like a car park...lift system .well ..when busy just did not work..once in the room great .great location..we have been to times sq before and would stay at previous hotel..great gym'
1,'To be avoided at all costs.','This hotel is to be avoided at all costs. We arrived at 8pm (having made reservations for three rooms and having phoned and confirmed them in advance) and after waiting in line for an hour were told that the rooms were not ready as they didn\'t have any cleaning staff. We were asked to wait in the bar until 1am! As we\'d travelled from the UK we had been awake at that point for 23 hours. The reception staff were rude, evasive, unhelpful, aggressive and even foul-mouthed. They basically told us that it was tough luck and we\'d have to wait. All the European guests were left till last to be checked in and reception looked like a refugee area. When we finally got a room it was a dump. We\'d requested a king size bed but got twin beds. The sheets weren\'t clean. The carpet was dirty. The safe didn\'t work. The internet connection didn\'t work. The light in the shower had water in it. The bathroom was mouldy. The shower handle was snapped off. The TV didn\'t work. I could go on and on but frankly it\'s too depressing to even think about it. In short, the Park Central is a pathetic excuse for a hotel filled with staff whose idea of customer service is to be rude and surly.'
5,'Perfect Weekend Getaway','We had a wonderful stay at the Affinia. Starting from check in to check out, everything was flawless. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The rooms are nicely modernized and spacious with a nice size kitchen. We were on the top floor and the view was spectacular. Very convenient location to everything. Definitely will come back again.'
4,'Superb location and value','Stayed four nights in October in excellent 2-Queen bed studio on the corner looking towards Penn Station and down to Times Square. Booked via travelrepublic six weeks ahead and got a great deal.\r\nRoom was clean and bright, Huge fridge in well resourced kitchen. There is a shop for groceries two doors down. Restaurants aplenty nearby. We breakfasted mostly at Andrews Coffee Shop three blocks away: great diner with all the classic favourites with a mixed crowd.\r\nOver the road is Harrington\'s bar and restaurant. Went for lunch to watch a football (proper football=soccer) match from London (Fulham v Roma). \r\nGot a metro pass with $20 loaded on and it lasted four days. Walked to Grand Central, Empire State (book ahead), Times Square (Lion King was amazing) and Macy\'s (two blocks away).\r\nA BIG shout to the women at the concierge desk in the lobby: incredibly helpful and knowledgable. You can print off your boarding pass there too.\r\nI would definitely go there again, especially if you can get the deal.'
5,'Excellent Hotel but Beware of Car Valet Service','My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a couple of days (October 11-13, 2012) I thought the location was great for our needs and we thoroughly enjoyed walking through Grand Central Terminal. The rooms were nicely decorated and always clean. Requests for additional towels and pillows were satisfied very quickly. The staff were courteous and helpful; all of which you should expect from a 4 star hotel.\r\nHOWEVER.......As the title suggests, there was a major problem with the car valet service. The problem was not discovered until we were well on our way home, but nonetheless was extremely disappointing. Approximately $20.00 in change was taken from a closed compartment. Now, I know that one should never leave valuables in your car, but I thought that there wouldn\'t be a problem. We never used the car while in NYC. Obviously this theft occurred by the individual initially parking our car, or the person returning it when we were leaving. This was not a lot of money, but I felt violated and quite upset. The moral of this event is NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING IN NEW YORK. The fact that this could happen at such a fine hotel is disturbing. This alone, would prevent me from staying there again.'
4,'Great location and hotel, no complaints!','My first trip to NY and so glad I stayed here. In the heart of the action, situated with Central Park at one end of the road and Times Square both 5 mins walking distance away. The hotel was nicely decorated, clean, and reasonable price for a 4*. Rooms good size and quality. Desk staff very helpful and friendly, recommending things to do and not to buy tickets through them as it\'s cheaper to do it directly at the box offices. Had no complaints at all!'
5,'GREAT HOTEL-IN CENTER OF EVERYTHING','Hotel was clean, spacious. We expected it to be a tiny room given the city and its location. It wasn\'t, it was close to many activitites and GREAT restaurants. Would definitely go back!'
2,'Don\'t stay just for the POOL!!','My family stayed at this location for one night before the tree at Rockafeller Center was taken down. From the outside, the hotel looks great and is located in a prime location - literally 3 blocks from Rockafeller center. Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square with plenty of sights to see.\r\nWe picked this hotel mainly because it is one of the few in NYC that has a pool. Since we were traveling with two children ages 7 and 8 it is always good to have in case of bad weather, etc. \r\nUpon entering the lobby, we were impressed, very nicely decorated, clean, and rather impressive. Check in was fine and even though I booked a room that was to be on the 44-46 floors, I was placed on the 42nd. No big deal there, still had club access. I believe that this is a waste of money. We did not use it enough to make it worth the extra money paid.\r\nWe had two rooms each with 2 double beds. My room had a fabulous view of the river and the cruise ships, One of the major problems was that the window would not close, so the wind would be howling and whistling until the engineers came up to close it. Our other room had the same trouble with their window as well. The room was a good size, bedding was not up to par with Marriott, and was a little on the hard side. The room appeared to be renovated, but the bathroom was an obviously last done in the 80\'s. Dark Brown painted cabinets, flourescent lighting in the ceiling, mirrors everywhere, and old fixtures. Clean but just not new or updated. \r\nThe biggest complaint I had with the room is that the entire hotel turns off it\'s air conditioning in the fall and doesn\'t let you cool your room until they turn it back on in the spring. However, when we were there it was over 60 degrees during the day and the room was so hot that it was nearly impossible to sleep at night. I was able to open up the window about an inch but it did not cool anything. So, a couple nice days and you may be very uncomfortable. And there is nothing that you can do about it. However, the other room that we had that was down the hall was not as warm, so maybe the temperature varies in the different rooms? \r\nThe kids were excited to go to the pool which was on the 15th floor. So we went. That was when we realized that we were going to an actual NY Sports Club not just a pool for the hotel. Upon checking in at the front desk the kids were given swim caps that were mandatory. ??? They had never been asked to wear those before. Anyway, the pool was about 20 feet long and 4 lanes wide. There was a lovely (NOT) lady that appeared to dislike when children use the pool. She told them to stop at everything they were doing. No Kidding. They couldn\'t do anything without getting the evil eye or a warning. It was not very fun for them nor was it relaxing for us. We left after 20 minutes or so. SO if you are staying at this hotel for the pool DON\'T. Stay at Le Meridian, or another hotel. \r\nAll in all it was a decent stay for 1 night. Would I stay here again, probably not. There are many other hotels in the area that are cheaper and nicer. Sure they may not have a pool, but maybe there are enough things to do that you don\'t need a pool anyway.'
4,'Goed hotel, centraal gelegen, fantastisch uitzicht!','Goed hotel, midden in NY, op loopafstand van Times Square en shopping district.\r\nKeurige kamers, mits kleine bijbetaling upgrade naar grotere kamer (35e verdieping, met Empire State building view). Aanrader!'
4,'Thanksgiving parade participant','This hotel is in a great location. It\'s within walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, shopping, theaters, Rockefeller center, Radio City Music Hall, etc., and there is a subway entrance (F) to the north at 57th & 6th Ave.\r\nWe didn\'t have a car to park, so I don\'t have a report on the parking situation.\r\nThere was a deli (53rd Street Gourmet Deli) across the (side) street that probably gets most of their business because of this hotel. We bought drinks & food there and avoided the hotel restaurant. \r\nNeedless to say it was crazy busy because this was the host hotel of the parade participants in our group (probably at least 1,000 high school girls along with their families!), but from what I could tell the hotel handled things great. We had zero problems with the room, checkin or checkout. There was sometimes a wait for the elevator, but completely understandable because of the sheer number of people staying there.\r\nEvery hotel employee I interacted with was friendly and professional. There is even a boarding pass printing area which was free of charge. This hotel is in a great location and upon our eventual return to New York we will stay there!'
4,'Un tres beau sejour dans cet hotel','Nous avons sejourne dans cet hotel pendant 3 nuits et avons ete tres satisfaits de celui-ci.\r\nLe service de chambre etait de grande qualite. Les petits dejeuners tres bons et bien complets, avec de nombreuses viennoiseries aussi bonnes qu\'en France.\r\nNotre chambre etait tres spacieuse et tres propre. \r\nCet hotel est tres bien situe.'
3,'Great Value for Location','Stayed three nights with my sister for a shopping/sightseeing excursion to New York. Got a great deal on a double room through via Trip Advisor web site and thus my review will be more biased based on price paid. Hotel entrance gives one impression of a much more modern hotel and once you step out of the elevator, it is likely stepping into a totally different place which is definitely a disappointment. Hallways are narrow and dark. The room itself was, as expected, an very average room with two doubles but it was very clean and free of bedbugs which was a relief. We did a complete check of bed, sheets and between mattresses with no signs of the little critters and no bites in the morning. We did find the room temperatures too hot at times but as there was no air conditioning running in hotel, the only way we could cool it down was to open the windows. The service desk offered to send up a fan and a service man came within 20 minutes of our complaint to show us how to open the windows. We were happy enough with this resolution. The service was excellent in the hotel, check-in was fast and pleasant, the concierge was extremely helpful in assisting us in best ways of getting to airport and the cleaning staff were always very pleasant in the hallways. We did not eat at the hotel. The location is the best feature of this hotel, walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue - you can\'t beat it. Metro Stations very close by and surrounded by many restaurants.'
4,'Good Location - OK Place','The hotel is a bit tired\r\nIt is clean but could use a little updating/polish\r\nThe staff is minimally attentive and not very polished either\r\nIf you can get it at the reduced rates, it\'s a good deal'
5,'excellent hotel)., great service','I travel to New York at least 4 times a year and prefer to stay on the Upper West Side (Beacon) if I am in town for more than two nights. Recently my stays have been just one or two nights and I have stayed fairly regularly at the new Staybridge Suites Times Square (qv). Last week they were sold out but I found a room at a good rate at the Crowne Plaza Times Square. I was a little nervous at the potential noise/Times Square \'madness\' having stayed here 10 years or so ago.\r\nI was very pleasantly surprised on several levels. My check-in was smooth and friendly - I had a room \'pre-blocked\' on the 25th floor but the clerk immediately offered to give me a higher room if I would like it. I ended up on 41 with a superb view over the westside to the Hudson. Another nice surprise (unprompted) the clerk advised that as I am a Platinum member with IHC I was entitled to free internet and free breakfast buffet (worth at least $50 a night).\r\nThe elevator bank is split into 1-25 and 26 - 45 so again very little wait time (even with a sold-out hotel) and super-fast elevator service.\r\nThe room was spacious and well designed. Two double beds, super modern bathroom, mood lights, huge flat screen TV, opening windows (a huge benefit to me) and individually controlled air-con/heating.\r\nFor the occasional visitor or first time tourist the location really couldn\'t be better - the TKTS TKTS booth is outside the door, all of the mid-town highlights are easily walkable and there are several subway stations within a block or two and Times Square/42nd Street five minutes walk at most.\r\nI am back in the city in November and won\'t hesitate to stay here again.'
4,'H....come Hilton','MI è capitato solo una volta di essere stato in questo Hotel e devo dire che me ne è rimasto un ottimo ricordo...\r\nSicuramente uno dei tanti Hilton...però con una marcia in piu\'...\r\nCamere accoglientissime,tutti i servizi e i confort a disposizione...\r\nLa colazione è da provare perchè offre variegatissime sfumature internazionali adattate ad uno stile cosmopolita e di qualità adeguata,\r\nper la sera poi impossibile non provare il bar interno...pieno zeppo di gente anche estranea all\'hotel con una vastissima scelta di distillati, cocktail e quant\'altro...\r\nUn\'ottima scelta di lusso a NEW YOrk'
5,'Stylish hip hotel, beautifully designed public spaces and very helpful, friendly staff','I stayed in the Hudson hotel after checking out early from the quite appalling \'On the Ave\' hotel on a weekend visit to New York with my partner.\r\nAfter enquiring at the front desk, we were told that there were rooms available, but that they couldn\'t match the discounted rates we had seen on their website, though handily pointed out there was an internet cafe around the corner from the hotel if we wanted to book online.\r\nWe had intended to book a \'Loft Room\' but as non were available booked into a \'Double Double\'. The room was lined with dark wood paneling and came with modern furniture, desk, chairs, flat screen TV, HiFi music system and an iPod dock. The room seemed freshly decorated and was incredibly clean, the beds were very comfortable and the bed linen of very high quality.\r\nThe public areas of the hotel were all well designed and had a modern urban look. Although it has been open for some time now, the design has not dated and is well maintained. \r\nAfter a days shopping or sightseeing it was a genuine pleasure to return to this hotel, every single member of staff I had contact with was genuinely friendly and seemed concerned with ensuring guests had a good stay. \r\nAt peak times there was quite a long line at the front desk, but a cheerful member of staff managed this, speaking to those waiting and ensuring everyone was kept well informed and that no one cut in. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. After having such a poor time at my first hotel (On the Ave) the Hudson hotel and its staff turned around my weekend and made it one to remember for all the right reasons and not all the wrong ones like \'On the Ave\'.'
5,Mrs.,'Everything & everybody was so nice, close to everything. Easy check and check out. Will hold luggage for you. Great rooms and views.'
4,'Not fancy or large but great value and location','I have stayed here twice, once in 1991 and again in 2010 (it wouldn\'t let me select that far back) and had the same experience both times. There is something to be said for consistency. It is a great, old, art deco hotel. The rooms are small and the views are nothing to write home about. However, the location is GREAT. You are close to subway stops and just steps from Times Square. They were remodeling rooms at the time so they may have improved since then. This is a budget-friendly, convenient, New York City hotel. I would stay there again.'
4,'Great Location - Good sized lobby','As all other reviewers have stated, this hotel has an amazing location and is within easy walking distance of a wide variety of tourist destinations. The rooms are standard Westin - clean, comfortable with a touch of luxury. I had a beautiful view of Times Square and it was very quiet. I was here for business and the lobby was large, with lots of seating where I was able to hold some one-to-one meetings with no issue. The only complaint that I have was that one night as the restaurant was closed, I ate at the bar and had a mediocre and rather expensive meal. Otherwise, everything else was excellent.'
5,'Lovely stay at the Palmer House','This older grande dame was a wonderful location to spend Mother\'s day. The lobby is beautiful, staff very helpful, corner room with two windows and nice view given how packed the hotels are in the loop. The bed was comfy and the room was spotless. The location is perfect for walking to Millenium and Grant parks, the Art Institute, around the loop, or up Michigan Avenue. I got a great rate by doing a little searching on the net...can\'t be a better combination of comfort, elegance and value.'
5,'Excellent location for family holiday','If you are a family of 5-6 persons, you should rent a New Yorker suite. One large room with TV, small kitchen, a large dinner table and a double sofa bed. The other room with two double beds and television. Two bathrooms (Only one with shower). Next to Penn station, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building and Time Square. Resonable prices if you order some days in advance and for minimum 5 days. If you stay for a week, you should also order the New York City Pass from the internet (Pick up point 10 Minutes walk from the hotel), and buy a 7 days Metro card. This will give you lot\'s of nice attractions.(9/11 Mem, boat trips, bicycle, ESB +++)'
4,'Great location, good friendly service','We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. All the staff have been polite & helpful. They responded swiftly to our email enquiries prior to our arrival and followed up all our requests at check in without prompting. \r\nWe decided to upgrade to a room with a view and although small it had the promised view of the Empire State building & other iconic Manhattan land marks. As I said the room was small but when all we wanted to do is sleep in it, it was more than adequate. The bed was comfortable & the air con blissful! The bathroom was also on the small side and the only negative thing about our stay was the shower temperature fluctuated a lot! Which made for an interesting shower! \r\nThe housekeeping staff were lovely & whenever we saw them, enquired if we needed anything else. \r\nWe never had to wait more than a few minutes to get a lift to the lobby, we were on the 31st floor. \r\nWe used the Tick Tock diner on numerous occasions for breakfast, dinner & cake and were very impressed. The staff are pleasant & the service is very efficient. It is great diner food with generous portions. We can thoroughly recommend the Fudgy Wudgy Chocolate cake !\r\nThe hotel is in a fantastic location, literally five minutes from Macy\'s, 10 minutes to the Empire State Building, Times Square and many other tourist attractions. We walked a lot but the subway is just outside the hotel. \r\nThe concierge booked us two dinner & show packages for Stomp & One Man Two Guvnors, these were great value & great seats. Although opt for Alfredos as a place to eat over Jacks. \r\nWe are now off to Washington, which is going to have a lot to live up'
5,'glad to return','very glad to return to the Park central stayed here in 1984 \r\nvery large room excellent service and close to the park.\r\nBreakfast bar on ground floor was staffed by a delightful lass and the offering was wholesome\r\nwould not think to stay anywhere else in NY'
5,'Amazing hotel just off Times Square with everything you could ever need','The Westin is a gorgeous plush hotel with amazing rooms in a very modern comforable style. \r\nThe hotel is about a 2 minute walk from Times Square so the location is perfect. \r\nOur room was on the 45th floor and had 4 windows - something of a rarity in New York and the views of the city were stunning.\r\nThe room itself was really comfortable and had a huge bed and the bathroom had an amazing shower (over the bath).\r\nRoom service is also great and the portion sizes are rather large. We had take out breakfast which was also great.\r\nThe hotel bar is very nice, but can work out expensive compared to other bars in Times Square (but then most hotel bars are normally quite expensive)\r\nThe hotel also has its own cinema complex.\r\nA great stay in a great place - I would definately stay here again.'
4,'Excellent location,value for money','Stayed at this hotel recently on a leisure break with my wife.We booked hotel online and got very good price for 5 night stay.It is in an excellent location just a short walk to Times Square and right beside Broadway.Our room however was dated,but very clean.Could not fault hotel overall,breakfast was very good in the Edison cafe and the Rum House is perfect for a drink or two after theatre.This hotel is ideal for a short break in NYC,you cannot beat the location and is excellent value for money in my opinion.'
4,'Perfekt hotell för oss','Läget var kanon, nära central park, T-bana, delis och allt annat man behöver. Vi fick ett rum på 32:a vångingen vilket barnen blev överlyckliga över. En annan viktig sak är att rummen är stora vilket behövs när man reser 2 vuxna och 2 barn (Twin bed plus bäddsoffa i kingsize) Utsikten mot central park var fin men man fick ha tur med vädret för att verkligen se det :)'
4,'Nel centro del mondo!!!','Avevo prenotato direttamente sul loro sito con una buona tariffa senior siccome viaggiavo con i miei... ci e\' stato offerto un upgrade per pochi $ in piu\' a notte per una stanza con vista su Times Square e ne e\' valsa davvero la pena!!! \r\nOttimo hotel, stanze ampie e buon servizio in camera....\r\nSarebbe bello pernottarci a capodanno...chissa\'...'
3,WIFI,'No tenes posibilidad de usar WIFI gratis ni a un precio razonable en la habitación, solo en el desayunador.'
5,'It was stunning','From the lobby when we walked in I was overwhelmed by the beauty of this hotel. Stunning, jaw dropping beautiful. we had an executive level room. 2 bed & 2 bath with everything we could ask for. the beds were full, fluffy like a pillow bed should be. Slept great! the sound of the train was low and actually worked as a white noise, enough to let my 7yr old sleep all night & morning. The food was amazing, the staff accommidating, & pleasant, The pool was warm, the hot tub even hotter. We rarely left the large room except for walks around this grand hotel. Breakfast & hor dourves for us every day for free. The negatives: Our view was lacking, next time I\'ll request the corner room. Our only disappointment was housekeeping. Hard to catch them & took 2 days to turn our sheets, had to ask for towels, & they forgot to clean the 2nd bathroom. Otherwise, I\'ll never go anywhere else. Wish you had a book so I could just look at the pictures and remember my wonderful time. Thank you'
5,'Great hotel - fee for wifi lets it down','This is a nice hotel with rooms large enough to relax in (and not just perch on the end of the bed). The decor is modern and there\'s no sign of chintz. The location is perfect, right on Times Square, and in the theatre district. It\'s also next door to the Book of Mormon which came in handy for entering their ticket lottery.\r\nOur biggest gripe is the lack of free wifi. It is incredible to me that large hotels such as this still insist on milking guests for internet access. We seemed to find a loophole in that wifi was largely free in the lobby and on occasion you would then be able to access it for free when you took your device (phone/iPad) back to your room. However I suspect this was an aberration. Come on CP, give your guests free wifi!'
4,'Great Hotel','The four of us shared a room at the Westin around New Years and it was great. Very clean, well stocked, with excellent food and room service. The lounge was beautiful. Delicious drinks and appitizers and a very nice staff throughout the hotel. On New Years eve, the city blocks several streets off including the street in front of the Westin which made it easy to walk the one block right up to where the ball was dropped for a perfect view. I\'d recommend the hotel for its location and all around great service.'
5,'Wonderful Spa Room','We arrived very hot and exhausted after fighting the trains and subways from Jersey City with luggage at rush hour, (dragging everything through the masses in Times Square) in 98 degree humid weather. Check in took no time at all, and we were upgraded to a Spa room on the spa floor. It was wonderful. The bathroom was fabulous (and huge), with the best hairdryer I have ever used at a hotel. The robes were plush; the massage chair was sleek and powerful (so much nicer than the chairs you typically encounter at Sharper Image and nail salons). We had a panoramic view of the city without the obstruction of any large buildings within a block. The bed was fabulous, and they even provided tranquil spa-type music to aid in relaxation. From the bustle of Times Square, this was a very well-thought-out oasis in the middle of a bustling city.'
4,'Great hotel with perfect location!','Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and had a fantastic time, The loaction is perfect with everything you need close by.\r\nCheck in was smooth although they were a little stale in their approach - could have been a little more friendly.\r\nThe rooms are fab and large, i have been to a number of hotels in ny and rooms are usually very small.\r\nHotel bar is great with an area overlooking time sq, very pricy for drinks but you pay for the location. We had breakfast on the 8th floor one morning and its overpriced for what it is, better just to get some coffee and pastries from the little shop and eat in the bar area. Great place to eat just outside the hotel (cant remember the name) but it was great. \r\nIt is a conference hotel as well so the whole time we were their they had delegates with badges etc walking around but didnt cause any problems.\r\nWe ate on the top floor which is the View Restuarant - set menu which was fine and we waited a little while for a table by the window which was worth it. nice mix of people so you didnt feel out of place, the service however was a little rushed which you dont expect for the price you pay. They also do a buffett which looked great and this is in the bar area so give this a go if you dont want formal and you dont need to book.\r\nOverall it was great and would stay here again.'
4,'A decent hotel. That could be fantastic if their customer service improved.','Great hotel, with a great location. The hotel were aware that it was my partners 40th Birthday. Despite knowing this they did nothing at all to acknowledge this which was dissappointing. The conceriege staff were great though and helped us to plan trips and suggested bus and boat cruises which were great.'
4,'Great boutique hotel in downtown manhattan...','My boyfriend and I stayed here on a recent trip to Manhattan and had a pretty good experience. The room (which was a suite) was much larger than other NYC hotel rooms I have stayed in. The concierge was incredibly helpful and very resourceful. Loved the Philosophy bath products in the bathroom. We only had a few glitches. When my boyfriend and I checked in we had been on an all night flight from Costa Rica so we were hoping to check in early. The woman at the front desk told us that we could check in early to a suite for 30/nt more. She confirmed she was giving us a great deal as it would normally be at least 50/nt more typically. We confirmed that we would be able to change back to our original room the following night as we were traveling on a budget. My boyfriend later looked online and realized that we could have upgraded to that room online for 15/nt more. Not a huge deal, but not ideal either. However, the next day when we requested to move back to the cheaper room and my partner communicated what he had found online, they told us we could stay in the room we were in at no additional cost. The other thing that was a major downfall of an otherwise awesome room was a ghetto air conditioner. The air conditioner was clunky, loud and would often just erupt with noise in the middle of the night. Also a bit frustrating for a NYC hotel is having to pay for wireless when there are 15 starbucks\' around the area where it is free. I would however recommend this hotel as for Manhattan it is a great deal and definitely lived up to its 3.5 star hotel especially in the upgraded room.'
4,'Stayed with the family. Can\'t wait to come back.','I stayed here in a room with 2 double beds. The room was clean, comfortable, a decent size for manhattan, good amenities, and good size bathroom. The hotel was furnished nicely and has an amazing location. It\'s pricey but so is every other nice hotel with this proximity to time square and other attractions. There are theatres on the same street, a subway station entrance on the corner, stores, restaurants, and nightlife all within a few steps (literally) of the front door to the hotel. I\'d definitely stay here again.\r\nA couple of things to note. I drove here and when I pulled up there was only one staff member outside and he was handling the cabs so there was no help with our bags. I left my wife with 3 kids and the bags. I asked the staff member where the hotel parking was since it\'s half the price of the valet ($27/day vs. $55 with valet) and he said just park at any lot. However before I arrived I asked the hotel if they had parking and they said they had a lot with an agreement for a discounted rate. The staff member was of no use so I called the front desk from my cell and they gave me directions. I found it no problem. Too bad the doorman was too lazy or incompetent to provide decent instructions. When we left we just walked a block to the parking lot with our bags down the street since it was less of a hassle than going to get the car and trying to find one of the limited spots in front of the hotel.\r\nI\'d go back for the location alone. I also go free wifi, not sure, but when I checked in they told me it was free. I had to accept the charges but I never got charged. I am a gold preferred guest so that might be why but it was a bonus.'
3,'No wifi, expensive, not especially clean.','I\'ll keep this short: for $500.00 per night internet SHOULD be included. Furthermore, wifi should be the internet. It\'s absurd in 2010 to have to plug in one computer when Apple et. al. sell millions of wifi enabled devices. And, I repeat, for the price, it really should be included. Frankly, it just leaves a lasting bad impression when one feels nickle and dimed to death.\r\nThe room was a nice size, but wasn\'t especially clean. The bathroom, for example has trays to hold shampoo and facial tissue. Both were filthy. We stayed in room 1750 at the beginning of December 2010. We\'ve stayed here before because of the location, but we\'re done.'
2,'I’m clearly missing something','Let’s start with the positives. Correction. Let’s start with the positive. (Singular, not plural.) \r\nMark at the front desk was helpful and exhibited the best customer service I’ve experienced at any hotel. The best! \r\nAs for the rest of my experience at the Hudson – insert virtual eye rolling – I think I was being punked. I’ve stayed at other Morgan hotel group properties including the Royalton in NYC and the Mondrian in West Hollywood. The Hudson is awful. Just awful. The bathroom is about the size of a refrigerator. The rooms are about 8 ft. x 8 ft. I realize that NYC hotel rooms are tiny, but this is prison cell small. \r\nI had to ask the housekeeper for a top sheet for my bed. She said the duvet was standard but she would honor my special request for a top sheet. A sheet is a special request. What the bleep?!?! Plus, there’s no restaurant. Yes, you read that correctly. No restaurant. Instead, there are vending machines on each floor and a continental breakfast in the hotel’s library.\r\nHow is this considered a trendy boutique hotel? When did prison cell style living become uber chic?'
5,'Loved New Yorker!','Hotel is in perfect location to see all the sights. Felt very safe walking around this area at night. Upgraded & got brilliant corner room on 22nd floor with lovely view of Empire State. In hindsight, really in NY all you want of a hotel room is the bare minimum as you definitely won\'t be spending any time there with so much to do & see so it\'s probably not worth upgrading. No safe in room, just safety boxes in Reception but they are not big enough for an ipad - that\'s my only moan! Otherwise it was perfect. Tick-Tock Diner serves great food quickly. Lovely fluffy pillows & quilt, great big lobby & free wifi in lobby & room - what more could you ask for!!'
3,'Great location','The best the Edison has is it\'s location at Times Square and clean rooms. We have stayed during the Christmas season for the last 8 or 9 years and it is perfect for our needs. We love to go to the theater, but have also visited the Lincoln Center performances, and toured many other places easily accessed with the subway close by.\r\nYes, it is tired, rooms are small and yes some of the staff is tired, but over all good value. Breakfast in the connected restaurant, while not fancy, fast and good. Coffee available at 6am. Sophia\'s restaurant also connected (but not part of) is very nice for lunch or dinner, but make reservations.'
1,'The Twilight Zone','This was, by far, the strangest place I have ever stayed. I was first struck by the trendy (and cool) facade that lacked any indication that I was at the right place (no name on the building, no address on the door). I was told by a staff member that this was to increase curiosity and draw people in. Once I got in, I wanted nothing more than to get out.\r\nLet me elaborate. I like to be pampered, but pampering I did not get. Instead, I got a tiny room with just inches between the wall and the bed. I got funky lights (decorated with nightmarish body parts) that worked only half the time. I got a hidden thermostat, requiring a secret trick to access (many thanks to the wonderful housekeeper who took pity on me while I was freezing and shared the secret). I got a television almost too small to see, that would not stay off. Really. I\'d turn it off, and a few seconds later it would come back on. No one seemed to be able to fix it. I got a tiny bathroom with only a sheer curtain to separate it from the rest of the room (okay, there was a door, but there was no wall between it and the rest of the room. I had to close the shower curtain for privacy). I got some weird metal tray, which looked like a soap holder, sticking out of the wall, which injured me as I tried to walk past it (was it for a housekeeper\'s tip?). I got a tiny bedside table just big enough for a phone, and a little stool underneath it that I pulled out to use for my water glass. Nothing else would fit on it. I got a hallway that made me feel like I was on my way to my execution. I got no towel racks, save the little buttons sticking out of the wall. I got no ice bucket. I got no drawers. I got no blankets, until I called housekeeping. What I did get, however, was good service from the staff. They made my stay somewhat bearable.\r\nThe lobby is trendy and cool. The bars are okay, but overpriced and meat-markety (I truly thought I was going to be able to read in the library; much to my chagrin, it was just a trendy pub, albeit with hilarious photos of cows in stylish hats).\r\nOverall, this place is just plain strange. It is uncomfortable and overpriced. Luckily, my friend and I had a good laugh at each new eccentricity we found. However, I will NEVER set foot in the place again.'
1,'Horribly odd experience','We arrived at the Hudson excited for our New York adventure to begin. We checked in without any problems, and the staff were relatively polite. We got on the elevators which seem abnormally small only to get to our hallway which was dark, dirty and a little scary. The carpets seemed old and there was a weird stench in the hallways. It was a scene straight out of a cheap horror film - I was waiting for someone to jump out and start chasing us (that feeling never went away). We got to our room and opened the door only to find that it was TINY. The entry hall was not even the width of our luggage and we had to move them in sideways to get them in the door. The bed was extremely low to the ground, close to the walls on both sides, and not particularly comfortable. There was one small table in the room that we had to move to the closet to be able to accomodate our stuff. The bed faced the bathroom, which enabled you to literally see (thanks to a glass wall) the other person in the shower and in the bathroom itself. The bathroom was so small I could almost turn on the water in the shower, use the toilet, and brush my teeth simultaneously (not even an exaggeration). My husband and I could not fit in the bathroom at the same time. My husband, who is 6\'2, had to use the toilet sitting sideways because his knees would hit the wall in front of him - it accomodated me but I\'m only 5\'2. It was SUPER loud and noisy at night and we had trouble getting to sleep at night. I guess it\'s a big party place sooooo the party happened just as we were retiring for the night from our long day out. Air conditioner sounded like a swamp cooler in that small room. \r\nThe positives were that it was conveniently located and had easy access to the subway. Staff was accomodating when our flight was delayed and held our room/reservation. \r\nI\'m sure this is just a hip new atmosphere I\'m not familiar with, but I\'d never stay there again.'
5,'Great staff great place.','I love the location and the staff I will stay again. The hotel is in a great spot to step out and catch a cab and in NY that is a must very close to Times Square. There is a deli a cross the street that just takes the cake they are very friendly and the sandwiches rock.'
4,'Immer mittendrin am Times Square','Einfach KLASSE!!!\r\nEin Hotelzimmer in der 43. Etage ermöglichte uns am 4. Juli, dem Independence Day, einen grandiosen Blick auf das Feuerwerk über dem Hudson River. \r\nUnd auch sonst konnte das Hotel Punkte. Super Zentraler Lage (besser gehts echt nicht), und trotzdem angenehm ruhig. \r\nZubvorkommender und freundlich Service rund um die Uhr, freie Internet, saubere sanitäre Anlagen, bequemes Bett und einfach der Ausblick machten den eigentlich viel zu kurzen Aufenthalt unvergesslich. \r\nZwar ist das Hotel preislich gesehen eher in höheren Kategorien angeordnet, wird seinem preis aber in jeder hinsicht gerecht! \r\nAlso wer sich von anstrengenden Shoppingtouren durch Manhattan einfach nur noch erholen möchte ist hier genau richtig!'
1,'Sub Par Front Desk','Checked into an old, worn out room with falling apart furniture. This should have been an out of order room. FD moved us to another room which was acceptable. FD agent could not have cared less. Location was great but did not make up for zero customer service.'
4,'Bonne situation, bon rapport qualité/prix','En lisant les différents avis, j\'avais très peur de la taille des chambres, New York ayant une réputation d\'avoir peu d\'espace et des chambres d\'hôtel très petites. Finalement, j\'ai trouvé la taille de la chambre convenable, d\'autant plus que vous passerez sans doute la plupart de votre temps dehors. Ne vous attendez pas à un palace. \r\nNous y sommes restés en tout 4 nuits. Notre chambre au 17e étage (pas de vue, malheureusement) était propre et contenait un lit confortable, un bureau, une télé. La salle de bain était aussi convenable, bien que légèrement vieillie. L\'hôtel a sans doute voulu conserver les équipements d\'époque pour conserver l\'esprit art/déco. \r\nJe recommande fortement le restaurant de l\'hôtel, qui sert des plats de cuisine locale qui sont délicieux. Il est idéal pour les jours de grande fatigue où vous préférerez sans doute ne pas sortir de l\'hôtel. Le personnel du restaurant y est très aimable.\r\nPoint négatif : les personnes à l\'accueil sont un peu froides. \r\nPoints positif : l\'hôtel est extrêmement bien situé, à côté de toutes les grandes attractions et de Times Square, Penn Station n\'est même pas à 5 minutes de marche.'
4,'Enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker','I stayed at the New Yorker for four days and ti be honest didn\'t know what to expect but I was pleasently suprised with the New Yorker\r\nThe hotel staff on arrival were more than pleasant and my room up on the 20th floor (2065 to be exact) was satisfactory, though the first night I arrived was at the end of a tropical storm and I needed the air con, this was a bit on the noisy side and had to be turned off before I could sleep, the bed was very comfortable, the room and bathroom clean and I felt secure\r\nThe view from my room was of a wall, another section of the hotel, and the light didn\'t exactly pour in, but I didn\'t go to New York stop in the hotel all day\r\nThe location of the New Yorker was better than I thought, it is situated just across from Penn Station, Madison Sq Garden and down the street from Macy\'s and the Empire State, it is in walking distance (I can walk it) from Time Square\r\nThere is no restaurant in the hotel, but this is more than made up for by breakfast and endless cups of free coffee at the \'Tick Tock\' diner through the connecting door from reception\r\nIn conclusion:\r\nI use hotels as a base, somewhere clean, where I can leave luggage safely and feel comfortable in, The New Yorker fitted the bill and I have no complaints'
5,'Great Location!','We stayed in the grand Hyatt New York for 4 nights in December 2008... First of all, New York is a great city, this was my 3rd trip but my girlfriend\'s 1st, there\'s too much to see and do there but staying at the Grand Hyatt made it easier thanks to its fantastic location. It\'s very well located downtown, a short walk from 5th Avenue and Times Square. A longer walk up to Central Park, but that\'s OK because walking around is what we do in New York, right?\r\nWe were lucky that we were upgarded to a suite thanks to a friend of mine who works for the Hyatt Group having made the reservation for us, but I would guess that the quality of the furniture, fittings, bathrooms is equal throughout the hotel. And that quality is top class.\r\nIf there is a downside, it is that the hotel is very very big, and that makes the lobby a crowded and busy place at times, but you have to love the multi cultural nature of New York and being in such a big place meant hearing different languages every day in the lift... Another downside is the costs of additions, wi-fi access in the room was $10 per day and a Starbucks coffee delivered to the room worked out at almost $15 including the room service charge, I\'m no scrooge but clearly that\'s ridiculous, a morning walk into the neighbouring Grand Central Station sourced the necessary morning kick off for a couple of bucks...\r\nWe used the gym every day, it is well fitted out and was never too busy. The room was great, overlooking the Chrysler building from the 17th floor. The room was well cleaned every day and a good size. All in all, we were extremely satisfied, again, as a base to tour all over New York, the Grand Hyatt is an excellent choice.'
3,'Location location location','So I\'m a little behind in my hotel reviews as our family (4) stayed here in September of 2010.\r\nThe hotel\'s lobby is one floor above ground level and was quite busy. Nevertheless a reasonable wait of 10 min. got us checked into our room without incident and with friendly service. It must be understood that this isn\'t the Trumph Soho and we had no expectations that it would be. Also, the price was reasonable considering part of our stay was over a holiday weekend. Room was furnished well, confortable beds and reasonable sized washroom for mid-town Manhattan. Yes, it was clean. We were concerned about some of the poor and terrible reviews on this site before booking. I suspect that there are various levels of renovated rooms in the hotel, maybe we just lucked out. \r\nOur expectation was that noise would be an issue considering we were facing Broadway with a view of Times Square nearly 40 floors up. Such wasn\'t the case (yes we heard some sirens but they were muffled) and we had a restful five nights. Whenever we had questions the concierge was pleasant and quite helpful. The gym and pool were a bonus for this location and we used it regularly but beware it\'s not for those under 16. The pool is only for lap swimming and does not accomodate young families. \r\nWe didn\'t eat in the hotel under the assumption that it would be outragely expensive (which I gathered from other reviewers that it was), so there\'s no comment, but there\'s plenty of eateries within a short walk - Manhattan priced but not hotel priced. Which brings me to the main point - the hotel is either walkable or a short subway ride to everything. The car didn\'t move for six days. As our family had such a blast for five days, we decided to extend our stay by a night. Although quite full, the hotel was quite accomodating and let us stay where we were. \r\nAs it seems to be a recurring theme of my reviews here, I\'d give this one a three and a half it Trip Advisor would allow me, but alas, I must round down yet again.'
1,'épouvantable - tres bruyant - chambre minuscule','très bien situé mais très bruyant , grace à la clim dont le plit est à moitiée dans la chambre\r\n-si on ouvre la fenetre, on a le bruit des autres clims qui crachent à coté ou la sono des soirées dans la cour de lhotel\r\nsans parler de la mauvaise insonorisation globale de lhotel\r\ncet hotel a la cote car le lobby a été refait par starck et il est vraieq ue ca en jette\r\nles chambres sont miniscules sans aucun rangement, on peut à peine faire le tour du lit\r\non peut largement preferer le hotel THE STANDARD, dans le meatmarket district, meme si cest moins central\r\nle service est tres moyen, nous avions fait un late check out, quon a essayé de nous faire payer au prix d\'une nuit supplementaire, et on est venu nous deranger toutes les dix minutes pour savoir quand on partait...\r\na fuir donc'
1,'bien placé mais a éviter','mal reçu, sale, literie en mauvais état, systeme electrique pendant et dangeureux, climatiseur avec une odeur de pourriture, personnel mal embouché, trés mecontente en tout point de l\'hotel. wifi payante, pas de coffre personnel'
3,'Stylish hotel to visit not to stay at...','Just stayed here for my 40th bday, always wanted to go to new york and chose this hotel from virgin holidays. On arrival very impressed with location and stylish interior, had read room sizes were on small side but thought would be able to cope with it.. Initially we did but as stay went on it got on our nerves. Our room was freezing! Window wouldnt close properly and there was a permanent draft, i alerted reception and was told the heating wasnt allowed to be turned on for another 2 weeks (never been told this before) was offered extra blankets to be sent to room, an hour later these still hadnt arrived. Rang down again and was told there was a backlog on blankets and they would be sent up. They never arrived.... Also our room safe didnt work. I think it is such a shame for such a beautiful hotel to be let down like this on simple points. It wasnt cheap and it spoiled my experience of a what was otherwise a great city break. Luckily we didnt spend much time in our room!! All in all a beautiful hotel to visit but not to stay at unless you get a room upgrade. Luckily we didnt do our shopping till end of stay as once we had we couldnt move around the bed!!!'
3,'Great value','I take theater groups into New York every year. I have been using the Edison for 18 years. It is an old hotel, but the service is good for the money. The rooms are clean. The location is wonderful! The food ok, but the breakfast is probably the best value in New York. I always recommend the Edison due to it\'s location and the price. In fact I will be taking 60 more people there this December.'
3,'as long as you dont pay full price its fine','I was hoping to share the room with my children.\r\nnot going to happen.\r\ntiny tiny rooms and sillly clear glass wall in the bathroom but\r\nfor discount room in the summer ok\r\nas long as you do not have to spend any time in the room\r\nit is clean, the staff was fine and the outdoor deck was great so\r\n1. get a discount\r\n2. go in the summer\r\n3. know it is 2 to a room'
3,'Not as bad as we thought, Great Location!','After reading the reviews on here we were a bit worried to say the least, so i thought it would add my views on here as it wasnt as bad as we thought at all. When arriving we were amazed how good the location was and its right opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, Check in took a while but it was Thanks giving day so i guess there was alot of staff off that day as it was a bank holiday, we requested rooms close together as there were 4 of us travelling and that was no problem, we had rooms on the 14th floor and were a bit worried about what we were going to find behind the door when we opened it, we found that it was very basic but was actually ok compared to what we thought it was going to be, it is basic, old and dated but the bedding was clean and changed every day so the maid service was good, the bathroom wasnt the best but there was hot water which was good, i would go back here as the location was excellent and really close to the empire state building and time square is only a short walk away. Also we were hardly there because we were out all day so it was just a base to keep our stuff and get out head down at night.'
5,'Excellent location,great hotel','My boyfriend and i stayed at the Southgate Tower for 5 nights beginning of February and we can\'t fault the hotel one bit. We arrived there at 10pm at night after a delay at Heathrow airport and when we told the receptionist he upgraded us to a suite which was great it also had a view of Empire state building!. The location of the hotel was brilliant for shopping, Times square, Empire state building 5 mins walk away and Madison Square gardens/Penn station is just across the road! The kitchen was fully equiped with fridge freezer, oven, microwave, toaster,coffee machine and all the utensils you need. The bed was so comfy and a choice of pillows it was bliss. We certainly would recommend this hotel to anyone who\'s going to New york.'
3,'Expensive breakfast','Breakfast at $35 seemed a bit steep; not surprising the room was mostly empty at prime time. Other reviews captured the rest - good location, reasonable rooms, expensive internet, not much personal service - but good functional place to stay.'
5,'One of the best hotels I\'ve stayed in','The Palmer House Hilton in the heart of the Chicago Loop really is a joy to stay in. It has a superb central location. Its architecture is glorious. The lobby and bar in particular are wonderful, but there are architectural, decorative, and art pieces throughout the hotel.\r\nMy room was very comfortable, with a good bath and the usual excellent comfortable bed. I was on an Executive Floor, and unlike some other guests here it was completely quiet apart from the occasional distant rumble of a train. Robes were supplied (but not slippers).\r\nI ate and drank in the Lockwood Restaurant and Bar. What a l\r\nMy only quibble is the same as many others; the WiFi is a rip-off. What with it being essential for work, and free WiFi available in so many places, it really is a cheap and nasty way of earning a few extra dollars. Go down to the lobby and pick up the free Starbucks Wi Fi.\r\nOther than that, I recommend it without hesitation.'
5,'Can\'t wait to get back to Park Central!','I stayed at this hotel three years ago. I got a great price and didn\'t have to suffer for that. The room was spacious and seemed newly renovated and we had no problems either with the staff or the room.\r\nI\'ve stayed in several 5-star hotels, and of course these are better. But if you consider what you get for your money, this hotel is as good as it gets!\r\nI\'m going back to New York for a romanitc vacation in February, and we\'ve booked 4 nights at the Park Central.\r\nI can\'t wait to go back!'
5,'\'Great Location friendly, helpful staff','Stayed for a two night stay 08 Sep12 and again for one night 11 Sep12. Location is great, easy walk to Times Square and theatre district, opposite Penn Station, and much more. Rooms modern, very clean and had everything you would need - coffee machine was a pleasant surprise. The second stay was in a deluxe room which was very roomy (large). Only had one meal in the restaurant (late lunch) and that was good. Staff at every contact point were very friendly and helpful. Would stay here again and the location for us (first timers to New York) was perfect.'
4,'Good Stay','We stayed at the New York Hilton during a long weekend in June. The hotel is very well situated for all the sights in the city as there is easily accessibility by taxi or subway. However, be warned that during the hours of 6:00pm – 7:00pm the taxi queue at the hotel is very long and you may wait a long time to get a taxi. Keep this in mind when planning your departure times.\r\nThe hotel is very busy and there are always large crowds in the lobby however on this occasion it did not cause us too much trouble and we were able to check in easily. We asked for a change of room while checking to something as high as possible and this was done without any fuss and we were given a room on the corner which was good as we then had two windows – also we were on a side road so the noise from the outside was not a problem.\r\nThe room was nice and well decorated with a small bathroom. There was nothing special about it but it was clean and well maintained. We unfortunately did have noisy neighbours who insisted on shouting and talking loudly to past 1:00am. We called downstairs and asked for them to be stopped and security must have done something as eventually the noise decreased.\r\nWe did not use any of the restaurants, room service or gym as there are plenty of restaurants in the area so cannot comment on these amenities. We did use the concierge to arrange for a car to take us to the airport and that was done quickly and efficiently.\r\nThe hotel was nothing to write home about but it did provide us with a decent place to stay in New York city at a decent price.'
3,'Correct !','Niveau rapport qualité-prix, il est préférable de prendre l\'hotel Carter, qui est moins cher et de même qualité..'
5,'Retro glamour in great location','My husband and I just stayed at the Palmer House on a Friday and Saturday night while in town for a wedding. Beautiful hotel! We were upgraded to a suite that was stunning. Excellent workout facility. Great location to check out downtown on foot. I\'d highly recommend this hotel.'
1,'A scary Halloween type place.....','We booked our room online, and were obviously fooled by the photos from the website. The lobby is not a good indication of what kind of room you will be getting! Once you leave the lobby and get off the elevator at your floor you will step into a horror film. The carpets are dirty and coming apart and are taped down with duct tape in places. The walls are filthy and the doors to the rooms are the strangest things I have ever seen in a hotel....and they are all stained and crumbling. And all this is before you set foot in your room! When me and my wife set foot in our room we both almost burst out crying..it was so bad. We didn\'t expect any luxury for what we were paying, but what we did expect was at least a clean place to lay our heads at night. This was NOT that place. The double bed was tiny, delapidated and the mattress was worryingly stained. The bed linen was awful with a heavy, itchy old blanket on top. The room itself was shocking...paint was peeling everywhere...the walls, doors and carpet had stains all over them. The A/C was busted. The bathroom was actually not bad in comparison althougth I must say I tended to squint a bit when I was in there so I didn\'t spot anything that might have freaked me out. They were very random with the clean towels...some days we got some, some days we got none. \r\nIt was a good job we were to spend minimal time in our room...we got up early and stayed out very late most days just so we could be away from the place...so much for a nice, relaxing, lazy weekend in New York! \r\nThere were always long lines at the front desk and check in seemed to take forever. The staff were kind of unfriendly as if they were doing us a favour by checking us in at all. \r\nI\'m glad we only stayed here for a weekend because I couldn\'t imagine being there any longer than that. Anyone that goes back to stay here after one visit much be a masochist! I would never stay here again...and would definitley advise anyone I cared about NOT to stay here. Do not be fooled by the online photos or the location, spend a bit extra money and go and stay somewhere else. This is what we will do next time. This place is daylight robbery and I\'m surprised that people can get away with running such a dump of a hotel in this day and age.'
4,'Huge hotel, convenient to Central Park and Times Square','I spent 2 nights in November \'12 at this Hilton. The standard king bed room exceeded my expectation. It was an easy walk to Central Park, Broadway, and Times Square. I am Diamond with Hilton and I enjoyed the lounge. If you are Diamond with Hilton, be sure to ask for your meal vouchers because they can be used anytime at the Starbucks and hotel restaurant.'
1,'TERRIBLE= downgraded room, new room was dirty, over charged, played games with','I checked into this hotel and placed into a room on the 12th floor. As soon as I got in, I was told I need to switch to another room, then downgraded into a dirty and musky room. They gave me the runaround to switch my room saying nothing is available, and then overcharged me when they finally put me into an appropriate room. \r\nDO NOT STAY HERE'
1,'Find another hotel','Our first room was on one the sixth floor so it was very very loud, loud enough that you couldn\'t sleep even with the window closed. The street outside constantly had people yelling, cars honking, garbage trucks banging. The room itself was tiny and there was mildew all over the ceiling. That\'s why we asked to be moved to another room higher up, which the hotel agreed to. While we were out in the city the hotel staff without our consent or presence went into our room and moved our belongings to another room. In the process my friend had her purse, shoes, make up, basically whatever was of value that was not locked up in the safe stolen. When we reported this to the security it was like talking to a wall and we were sent in circles where each staff referred us to another staff who referred us to another staff, until it was time to leave the hotel and go back home. How much luck do you think we had once we tried to get this looked into after coming home if they were useless while we were talking to them face to face. Do yourself a favor, find a reputable hotel even if it costs a little more or is a little out of the way.'
3,'Location is great, yes the rooms are small, but it\'s NY','Like other reviewers I agree the rooms were small, but we knew that having read the trip advisor reviews.\r\nAlong with small rooms, there were a couple of other things that could have improved our stay. The down escalotor to street level was broken, and it wasn\'t that clear how to get out... other than use the lift.\r\nGym equipment was broken and there are no toilets on the gym level.\r\nBreakfast is expensive for the choice/range you get. \r\nWhat you can\'t fault is the location. First timers to NY we loved the location of this hotel, as we walked to so many things and found the area safe and easy to get to.\r\nAlthough the room was small it was comfortable, very clean, quiet and the toiletries of good quality. Besides we weren\'t in our room other than to sleep.\r\nThey also make very good use of the small space and what they manage to get in. Although I suggest you pull both the curtains in the bathroom, so you can\'t see in from the bedroom!\r\nBut not so sure about the nightclub in the area off reception that is pumping on a Monday night.!'
3,'Slightly less than just OK.','The room is clean but the bathroom is extremely old and the tub/shower kind of disgusting. The room has a view of a brick wall. There is no room service menu, no channel line-up for the updated but small TV. The wi-fi is not working. There are no extra blankets, no cozy bathrobe, and no coffee maker!!!! You have to ask for anything you might want which to me, goes against everything a good, expensive hotel should stand for. I travel often and am staying here because a conference I am attending is here. I would not stay here again, nor reccommend to a friend. Stay at the W. Better service. Bigger, more updated rooms, and they do everything they can to please. You feel like another number ha the New Yorker. A number that they want to deal with as little as possible.'
4,'4 star hotel','I found the grand hyatt to be a very good hotel, the staff were all friendly and helpful should you need anything, the rooms a little basic but due to have a refit about now, but the lobby is gorgeous with eating breakfast with the waterfall by the saide of you was excellent. We went between christmas and new year and although one of the bars were closed due to quietness i presume there was more than enough places to eat and drink. Only thing i would mention about food is it was a bit pricey, i recommend unless you havent eaten all day try the kids menu cheaper and plenty of food. Cheesecake is to die for superb.'
4,'Very cool!','E\' un posto molto sofisticato dal design molto Stark, molto alla moda. Ovviamente se vuoi un soggiorno classico con una bella camera con vista non vai all\'Hudson, se cerchi invece vita e glamour questo è il posto giusto. \r\nPersonalmente per più di un paio di notti non ci resterei però il consiglio è quello di provarlo anche per i prezzi non da fuori di testa.'
1,'Waste of money, much better hotels out there for less','The rooms are so small you hit your knees off the bathroom wall when sitting on the toilet, staff were really unhelpful although they often smiled whilst being unhelpful. I had a business meeting booked for 11.00am in the lounge and was told I would have to wait until 12 to order coffee, after running around the hotel I did get coffee served in paper cups and charged almost 30 bucks them, the waitres refused to carry them to the lounge so spent another 10 mins hanging around the kitchen door. My room had cobwebs in corners and wasn\'t cleaned properly in bathroom. No information is provided in the rooms (basic stuff really) so called down to ask where the sky bar was and was told the 13th floor .... There is no 13th floor .. I stayed here almost 10 years ago and had a great stay but this place has truly lost its shine, I would never come back here again much better hotels out there for less money and with much better service'
5,'Perfect spot for NY visit','The Marquis is located in the heart of Times Square and smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. I was there for the Big East Basketball Tournament and spent most of my time around Times Square and the Garden and this location was perfect and LOVED the elevator system; seldom ever waited. Rooms are terrfic would definitely return.'
3,'Lovely Phillippe Starck lobby, but no room service?','For those of us in dire need of good interior design as part of one\'s holiday surroundings, \r\nThe Hudson does give you a quick fix as you first walk in and reach the reception desk. \r\nTheir terrace, lounge bar, library and restaurant are sharp and will not dissapoint you. The design of each space is bold and the dim lights in the lobby will actually help you get over the fact that you are in Manhattan and that your room is rather small.\r\nService was quite welcoming and friendly at the reception and concierge, but I was disappointed when I did not get a reasonable explanation as to why the hotel does not offer room service.\r\nThe cilantro conditioner and other uber cool amenities in my room were much appreciated, but really no room service?\r\nAlso their 60 dollar (or so) breakfast buffet is outrageously priced. Loved their muesli, but give me a break. Would I go back? Yes, but please can I have a sensibly priced bagel with cream cheese?'
4,'Merece la pena','Nos alojamos durante una semana en el Grand Hyatt, su situación para mí resulto ideal, nos alojaron en el piso 28 con vistas al maravilloso edificio Crysler, la habitación era amplia, el baño adecuado. En recepción no tuvimos probemas encontramos una persona que hablaba español. \r\nDesde el mismo hotel accedes a la Grand Central Station, lo que facilita el coger el metro.\r\nEl único pero a la estancia es que te cobran dos dolares por maleta si las dejas en la consigna del hotel'
3,'Our stay at the big apple','The hotel is conviently located with easy access to subway stops. \r\nHowever, there were not enough towels for two of us. We did not have a great view from the window, but we did not care since we were hardly in the room. In the mornings, catching the elavator was a big problem. We had to wait for a long time. The price was reasonable.'
1,'AVOID AT ALL COSTS','This was one of the worst hotels I\'ve ever stayed at, bar none. The room was smaller than a jail cell, the bathroom flooded when the shower was used (again, way too small), the staff was ambivalent at best. It would have been a more pleasant stay if I\'d slept in my car. The noise level was so high all night long, there is obviously no soundproofing anywhere. Miserable, miserable, miserable experience. I am unable to submit this review without checking at least one circle, that\'s a shame because it deserves something lower than a terrible rating.'
3,'Great service, paper thin walls, upgraded room big, regular rooms tiny','Just got back from four nights at the hotel, tagging along with my wife who was staying at the hotel while attending a convention in town. As indicated by the title of my review, it was a very mixed experience. The bottom line is that because of the very thin walls I wouldn\'t go back there, though otherwise it was a pleasant stay.\r\nOn the positive side:\r\n1. Since I am a Hilton Diamond, we were upgraded to a very large, comfortable room on one of the top floors.\r\n2. Especially since this is such a huge hotel (1700 rooms?), the service was very good, starting with check-in and including almost all other interactions. Picking up the phone to get room service, housekeeping, etc., I rarely had to wait at all to speak to someone and even if I did wait it was quite brief. And everyone I dealt with was helpful, efficient and polite.\r\n3. Decent lounge and minimally adequate buffet breakfast spread upstairs.\r\n4. Very large, well equipped fitness center.\r\n5. The hotel seemed to offer a pretty good suite upgrade deal to Hilton members, of about $90 (including tax) to get into a very large suite of about 1,000 square feet. It wasn\'t available when we were there since the hotel was full. But good to know about for less busy times.\r\n6. Easy phone check-out system\r\nOn the negative side:\r\n1. Perhaps the thinnest walls I\'ve ever seen...or really, heard! We could very clearly hear the televisions and conversations from the adjoining rooms on both sides of us. And it did not sound like the folks next door were shouting or being excessively noisy. My wife, who is a very sound sleeper, had to put in ear plugs. I would have thought that such an old, classic hotel would have had more solid walls than usual, but that was not the case. I did notice that there were doors connecting our room to those on either side of us, so perhaps that accounted for the noise. But I don\'t know if our room was unusual in that respect. \r\n2. While our room was fine, my wife\'s colleagues reported that the regular rooms were tiny.\r\n3. For those who love views, most rooms here just look out on interior courtyards; and some (as other reviews have noted) overlook the noisy elevated train line.\r\n4. Even though I\'d requested it in advance, I only got the nice upgrade when requesting it upon check-in. Kudos to the nice reception agent for putting us into it, but my point is that the Hilton automatic upgrade system for available rooms was not so automatic.'
2,'Sigh... disappointed','Our room was not ready. Was ok with waiting as our room was on the 23rd floor and we wanted a room on one of the higher floors due to noise concerns. The front desk attendant told us they would keep our luggage for us when readying the room and would deliver it to our room when we got back. They Subsequently gave our room to someone else who had complained about their room, and gave us their crappy one.\r\nPlaster peeling off of ceiling, dirty walls. Air conditioner smelled horrible. Towels were used and maintenance men kept knocking on the door as a result of previous occupants room complaints. We bid on Price Line and were forced to upgrade before arriving, resulting in higher bill for one week stay than had I paid full price elsewhere for a 4 star hotel (Times Square)\r\nNot happy. Had a seven night reservation and was forced to stay as I had paid through Priceline (no refunds), and another hold for the additional charges for the required Hudson Hotel room upgrade on my credit card. \r\nWill not bid in this area/star level if I ever decide to bid again. I would never stay here on purpose.\r\nLocation is good.'
4,'Good for the price','This is a good hotel for the price. Clean and the gym is really nice. I do not believe the pillows were the typical westin pillows. No upgrade as a Platinum member. Will be back in two weeks, will let you know if they upgrade or if no upgrade is standard and about the pillows.'
4,'EXCELLENT VALUE','Travelled to New York in April to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday and chose the Edison after reading previous reviews as it provided a central location in the city. We were still amazed on arrival to discover just how close to Times Square the hotel actually is,literally 50 yrds away.\r\nOur check in, despite arriving quite late was very smooth and we were allocated a room on a higher floor as requested. All staff from the doorman to desk and security were polite and very helpful. We had a family room with two queen beds, it was spacious and very clean and had a great view of times square as we were on the back of the hotel. The room was serviced every day with clean towels and sheets provided. The first night we did struggle with noise from what appears to be a heating system at the back of the hotel but after that it didn\'t bother us at all. The hotel in general despite being busy was very quiet from a noise perspective.\r\nI would recommend the Edison Diner for breakfast , great choice and very reasonable, might even see an odd celebrity or two as we did !! We didn\'t eat in the restaurant as there is a vast amount of diners and restaurants close by, be aware that being in the theatre district they all get very busy before and after shows. I could highly recommend the Triecolori Italian next door to the hotel, fabulous food and great service.\r\nAs a base for your trip to NYC I don\'t think you could beat the Edison for value for money, it may be in the process of a refurbishment and yes a lick of paint on some of the corridors wouldn\'t hurt but it was clean and staff were excellent. Would definately return in the future. \r\nIf travelling to NYC for a few nights take a look at the New York pass , saved us a fortune on location visits and tours.\r\nAlso don\'t be afraid to use the subway to get to the hotel from JFK, we arrived late Friday night but it was safe and quick to travel into Manhatten from Jamaica Station and cost half the price of a return taxi.'
4,'If you need space for your family and get a great price grab it','I needed space for four of us, my wife and fully/over grown teens, and practically gave up on finding a hotel in the heart of the City that would allow a rollaway with queen beds. This hotel has a double sofa bed with every room, whether with two doubles or a king, and thus fit the bill with room to spare. The comfort of the sofa bed was sufficient. As for ours, it was okay but I like Hampton\'s better. Also got a incredible price for an apparently off weekend, though they said they were full when we arrived. This was somewhat offset by the $55 a night valet parking fee and the $10 in and out fee. If you are not going to move your car (and you do not want to do this in the City) and are not worried about leaving your keys and security issues, you can find coupons on the web for parking a couple blocks away for about $40 and about ten blocks away for $30 for 24 hours. But for convenience and security... Oh, and they won\'t let you take a cart to take any luggage to your room yourself, lest they lose their tips. Fortunately, everything we had was on wheels. The speed of the elevators made up for the occasional wait of which others complain. Also, if you have any issue with walking (but then why are you in NYC?), ask for a room near the elevator, because ours was on the other side of the open interior of the hotel and that extra first walk from or last walk to the room... whew. Overall, good experience. Can\'t get closer to theatres or Times Square, but about four blocks from any subway in any direction.'
5,'What a week away from the kids . . .','This was the best hotel that I have stayed in while in NYC ever. I travel once a year and usually with the husband and kids. This time I stayed with my best friends for 6 days and everyday the staff was terrific! They made us all feel feel right at home from the minute we checked in. We were fortunate enough to get a room on the 28th floor and it was quiet and restful.\r\nI can not say enough about how great this hotel was ... I hope we can stay again next spring!\r\nThanks again Affinia...it was a great 40th birthday celebration week.'
1,'Some many things to say… but one word: DISASTER !','First of all, to check in we had to wait almost 30 minutes, the front desk is huge but there are only 3 employees. They don\'t really care about the customers and they\'re not particularly helpful and friendly.\r\nWe took the old and dirty elevator to our room on the 10th floor and what a surprise! Dust, mildew in the bathroom, the toilet is not even clean, I don\'t really wanna describe it… We called the front desk and asked for a room move.The person who answered first put me on hold without a word which is very upsetting!\r\nWhen we saw the 2nd room on the 4th floor, this one was worse than the first!!! I really thought it was a joke! There was smell of tobacco, dirty foot print on the bathroom floor… As you can understand we became very upset, and they gave us another room on another floor, nothing changed, I guess nobody cares about sanitary conditions in this hotel.\r\nWe asked to see the manager, but she could not give us something better, she was rude with us and told us that if we want something better we have to go somewhere else…\r\nGuess what we did?\r\nOf course we found another hotel near Times Square, cheaper and just renovated! (I\'m gonna write a comment on this hotel too, a good one!)\r\nI understand that a hotel is old, but I can\'t take a nasty place like that! \r\nDon\'t go there if you don\'t wanna sleep with rats!'
1,'What a Mess','This place is a mess. I am a platinum Hyatt member and just checked in the other day for 3 nights. They stuck me in a handicapp room. I have to kneel on the floor to hang my clothes up. When I use the toilet, my feet do not touch the ground. The room had no face clothes, no room service menu and the bathroom fan runs continuosly providing a water torture effect while trying to sleep. And this after their big renovation. I have tried to always stay at a Hyatt but now I am changing to the Marriott program as soon as I check out.'
3,'Buono ma non il massimo','Ho pernottato in questo albergo modaiolo nei pressi di columbus circle durante la mia honey moon per 4 notti in agosto.\r\nIniziamo dalle cose positive:\r\nLocation, vicinanza con la metro, central park, 5th, time square...\r\nHotel dove al primo piano è presente un pub esclusivo e un club frequentato da gente veramente bella.\r\nCose negative....\r\nLa camera in assoluto,\r\nSembrava di essere in una cuccetta dell\'interregionale milano/messina.\r\nSpazi vitali ridotti all\'osso, con la perla dell\'impianto di condizionamento posto sulla testata del letto, che dire, meno male che a new york stare in camera è tempo perso...e in questo a caso, direi, a maggior ragione!!!!'
2,Fuja!!!,'O hotel é horrível, está caindo aos pedaços! O pessoal da recepção é extremente mal educado, acima da média dos novaiorquinos! Os quartos são minusculos, as paredes sujas parecem não ver tinta há anos. O banheiro é antigo e minusculo. Contudo, a localização é muito boa, em frente ao Madison Square Garden e a alguns poucos metros dos teatros da Brodway. Pelo preço pode-se encontrar outras opções melhores, sugiro o Hamptonn inn Empire State Building (bem próximo), que tem free internet e café da manhã incluso na diária.'
4,'centralissimo a due passi da .... tutto!!!!','sono stata all\'Hilton di N.Y. a novembre . La posizione è perfetta per chi come me si è recata per la prima volta a N.Y. Vicinissimo a tutto quello che secondo le guide è d\'obbligo visitare :\r\nmoma,times square, rockfeller center, central park ecc. La camera che mi hanno dato era un poco datata e bisognosa di qualche manutenzione, ma vista la posizione dell\' hotel, in camera sono rimasta poco solo per dormire.'
5,'Perfect Location. The room was large with a stunning view...','We had a fantastic week-long stay here with our small children.\r\nFirst, the location: It could not have been better. The hotel is in the heart of Times Square and a couple blocks from fantastic restaurants in Hell’s Kitchen. The subway is a block away and there were always waiting taxis as when you got downstairs. It made getting around very easy.\r\nThe highlight of our room was its view. It had a floor to ceiling view of Times Square. Despite the perfect view, the room was so well-insulated, we never heard either the street or our neighbors. Our two-bed room was very large by NYC standards and had no problem fitting two full-size cribs (provided by the hotel) and our two strollers. The furniture was clean and relatively up-to-date. There was a 42 HDTV. Our favorite part of the room was the two comfortable chairs by the window – we spent hours sitting in the chairs just looking out at amazing view. If you’re staying at the hotel, definitely ask for and pay for (if applicable?) the rooms overlooking Times Square.\r\nWe all around great service. Check-in was a breeze. Our luggage was all handled by the bell staff – we didn’t touch a thing. The cribs we ordered were waiting and set-up in our rooms. Everything was perfectly friendly and efficicent.\r\nBased on reviews we read here, we never bothered with the hotel restaurants or room service. Besides, Hell’s Kitchen is two blocks away – there’s dozens of great restaurants to choose from there. But, here’s a good tip – right at the base of the hotel (on 46th) there’s a little hole-in-the-wall pizzeria called Patzeria. They were perfect if you needed a fast, easy, cheap dinner or lunch in your room. They’re reviewed here:\r\nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d778986-Reviews-Patzeria_Perfect_Pizza-New_York_City_New_York.html\r\nWe will definitely be back to this hotel.'
3,Disappointing,'My fiance and I had some appointments in the city, and hhonors points to use, so I convinced him that we should use them at this hotel. My parents had stayed in the past, and it was highly recommended.\r\nCheck-in was a breeze with the separate area for HHonors, which was great because it felt like there were at least 3-4 wedding parties having pictures in the lobby area.\r\nWe ended up on the 9th floor, and when we got to the room (the elevators are very slow at times), we found it to be very clean and decorated nicely. There was no view, however, and it didn\'t have things you\'d expect in a hotel of this class (only a single sink in the bathroom, no coffee maker, no mini bar, etc.).\r\nWhen we went to bed, we found the biggest downfall of the hotel -- there is absolutely no soundproofing between the hallway and rooms. When one of the wedding parties hit our floor around 2am, neither one of us were as excited as they seemed to be.\r\nOh, something else curious...the bathroom appeared to share a vent with the room next door, and light came through it all night.\r\nOverall, we\'ve been to better places in the city.'
3,'Nice lobby but small guest rooms, tiny bathrooms','The Palmer House Hilton is one of the old, classic hotels in the downtown Loop section of Chicago. The best things about this hotel are its grand lobby and its convenient location within an easy walk to the Art Institute of Chicago, Millenium Park, Grant Park, buses and trains, and plentiful restaurants and stores.\r\nThe front desk check-in was efficient but not warm and friendly. The hotel is huge so I had a long walk from the lobby to my guestroom. Many guestrooms are noisy due to the close proximity to the El trains whicgh run right next to the hotel so if you\'re a light sleeper you can ask for a room away from the El. My room was an interior one overlooking a non-descript courtyard. The room was very small and the bathroom was so tiny I could barely close the door without hitting the toilet ... probably the smallest bathroom I\'ve seen in North America and even small by European hotel standards.\r\nThe hotel charges for using its WiFi signal and the while there is a Starbucks on the ground floor of the hotel, this Starbucks does not have a free WiFi signal either for Starbucks cardholders. The hotel does have a business center which allows guests to print their boarding passes for free.\r\nThis hotel would not be my first choice but the convenient location is indeed a plus.'
2,'Tourist Trap Hudson','The Hudson has pleasant communal areas, the rooms are tiny but stylish. My problem with the Hudson was the way they dealt with payments and charges. They put a hold on my cc for double the amount of the room - it took 3 phone calls to get it taken off. We had $45 of minibar charges - we didn\'t use the minibar (these were taken off when we complained), my i-pod went missing from the room - we complained they sent back a very formulaic email. valet parking was $46 per day! - the most I\'ve ever paid in NYC. I have stayed in many NYC hotels and this totally put my back up. They have a lot of tourists and it seems are not interested in repeat business.'
4,'Perfectly comfortable hotel!','We stayed July 11-13 2011 and were quite pleased. Great price for a room so centrally located. We had a queen bed (w/ excellent mattress) desk, fridge, small chest of drawers with a 19 flatscreen. Bathroom was perfectly adequate with instant HOT water. This glamouous old hotel gives you the feeling of the early 20th century. Nothing wrong that a paint crew couldn\'t fix. All the door ffames were needing a touch up from years of maid service. The chest in the room was also beat up at floor level, so at least you know they religiously vaccum. Kenneth at the front desk was a complete pleasure to deal with, but avoid the front desk manager because he truly is an [--]. I will admit there was a long check-in line. There were three people working it, but there was a huge amount of people checking in, too. One tip -don\'t go on vacation in NY and expect cheery, because New Yorkers don\'t do cheery. No Howdy Ya\'lls. New Yorkers are extremely friendly and helpful but don\'t push them. They have had enough of us tourists. Overall, I\'ll stay at Hotel Penn again and again!'
4,'Great location','Crowne Plaza is in a wonderful location if you want to walk to see a play, go to Rockefeller Center, shop on 5th Ave., see the sights in Times Square, enjoy Central Park, or catch a red bus for a tour of the city! It isn\'t a kid-friendly hotel . . . but who hangs out at their hotel when they are in New York City! If you are staying on the lower floors, the rooms are okay. I would only recommend staying their if you can get a good rate. I wouldn\'t be worth $300 or $400 per night.'
5,'Highly recommended','I visited the Hudson Hotel with my girlfriend at the beginning of June. The rooms are small, but extremely comfortable. With all the horror stories I\'ve heard about dirty hotel rooms in NYC- the Hudson was such a relief, the room is incredibly clean and well maintained.\r\nThe Hudson Bar was such an amazing place to hang out in the evening, it\'s a really upscale night club with great music, drinks, and the atmosphere is really unbeatable. The ambiance of the entire hotel is just one of a kind and you come to appreciate it really fast.\r\nThe hotel is really trendy, and if even for a couple days- it really makes you feel like a celebrity or someone special.\r\nThe breakfast was a little pricey, but well worth it- the food at this place is second to none.'
4,'Size matters','We knew we had a room problem when front desk answered my question has it a view with it has a window. Who says they don\'t do irony in the States. The room was tiny, just a queen bed and carpet space sufficient for our two cases to stand upright. We almost had to take it in turns to breathe out. But we were rescued from this problem by ? Biquet. I requested a paid upgrade but there was nothing until Biquet thought, checked , then offered a much bigger room (very comfortable queen, armchair, fridge, desk, chair, plenty of floor space, huge bathroom). Biquet, you saved our next two days. Many thanks. Air con was central, piped, quiet and effective, a huge plus given the 95F heat wave on July 24 / 25. Bed was very comfortable and Art Decor furnishings nice and modern. The view was over to Hudson River so only a little bit of NY street noise intruded, with sirens, taxis plus some drilling at 5am out on the streets, but hey this is New York.\r\nLocation is brilliant for walking Central Manhattan and also quick for the subway. Penn Stn a block away and Port Transit Authority was walk-able. Empire State Building was in your face when you looked up ... loved the sign stating the obvious pointing to ESB.\r\nSecurity around the lifts was reassuring rather than annoying. We were never asked for our room cards but good to know someone would stop routine access to guest areas. Lifts up to floor 20 seemed to be taken by students. Hotel guests seemed to be floors 21 & higher using the opposite bank of lifts. On leaving we took a yellow cab back to Newark airport from the rank outside hotel. Standard fee of $68 inclusive of tolls but not tip. We were too late to book with the in-hotel limo franchise, but to be honest we could then go when we wanted rather than worry our car wouldn\'t arrive.\r\nWould go back.'
4,'Fantastic location','My boyfriend and I stayed at the Park Central during the first week of November 2006. Having read the mixed reviews on this site we were slightly nervous, but we needn\'t have been, the hotel was great.\r\nThe location is perfect, a couple of blocks from Central Park and from Broadway, and most importantly only a few minutes walk from Tiffanys!!!\r\nThe room was great value for money, good size and facilities and we had a great view.\r\nThe only negative I can give is that our keycards for our room failed to work on a daily basis. And the reception staff kept blaming us - we heard numerous reasons - we\'d kept the cards too close to our visa cards, we\'d been to too many shops so the security sensors had \'de-activated\' our cards..... really annoying having to trudge back and forth to Reception to get a new card. \r\nOther than that, can\'t fault the hotel and would definitely stay there again.'
4,'Great views and a few downsides','I stayed here on the 27th floor for 3 nights. There was a lot to like about this hotel, especially the fantastic location with great views and the oversized (by New York standards) guest rooms. The room was very clean and the staff were all pleasant and helpful. I also liked that there\'s a Starbucks on the 1st floor--that gives a quick and relatively cheap option for breakfast or coffee. The beds were comfortable and even on St. Patrick\'s Day there was less street noise than I expected. The room had lots of outlets and things that are helpful for a business traveler.\r\nThere are a few downsides. One is the cost, especially when you add in $16/day for internet. And the wireless internet service was spotty, which was annoying. I ended up switching to wired. The physical layout is also a bit odd. The check-in lobby is on the 8th floor, and the elevators, while fast, use a system which takes some getting used to (and which seems to confuse a lot of people at first). And of course there\'s none of the charm you\'d get in a smaller boutique hotel.'
3,'Good location, clean and friendly','I stayed at this hotel for four nights whilst on a business trip to NYC. The hotel staff were very friendly and the room was clean and even had a view overlooking part of Manhattan. For the price I had expected more though, in particular a larger room. Having read so many reviews by American visitors to Europe complaining about the small size of rooms in European hotels I was quite looking forward to seeing an American hotel room for the first time! But I realise New York (and Manhattan in particular) is not representative for America.The bed was comfortable and the location quiet yet central. Cleaning was very good, but the room had seen better days and the door was often difficult to open and close. Hopefully this room was going to be renovated since I understood many rooms had already been done up. \r\nI did not try breakfast in the hotel, but heard from others that it was good. At night time the hotel became a popular bar and meeting place, the lobby even felt like a club. But once you went up the elevator to your room it was quiet and I experienced no disturbances. The only noise (which was quite loud) was the collective sound of all the air conditioners in the courtyard. I did see the business centre downstairs as we had a meeting there. No complaints there and again the staff was very friendly.\r\nThe location was good - a few minutes on foot from Central Park which was lovely. It was also easy to walk to the theatre district and many other parts of this fascinating city.'
4,'tolle Lage, ordentliches Zimmer','Das New yorker Hotel hat eine traumhafte Lage, direkt am Madison Square Garden und der Post. Man kann zu Fuß zum Herald Sq (Macys) und zum Times Square gehen. Außerdem gibt\'s eine metro ststion der blauen Linien A B C direkt in der Straße und eine Straße weiter die roten Linien 1 2 3. Man kommt also überall super hin.\r\nDas Hotel hat eine tolle grpße Lobby (gut klimatisiert). Unser Zimmer war gut. Zwei große Betten, jedoch nur ein kleiner Gang zum gehen, was aber ok war. Ausblick war toll, Blick nach vorn auf Madsion Sq G., das Empire State Building und Chrysler Building. Fenster kann man öffnen und die KLimaanlage funktionoiert tadellos ;)\r\nDas Bad war ok, die Badewanne schon etwas alt, benutzt, aber alles sauber.\r\nFazit ist, dass New Yorker ist eine gute, empfehlenswerte Adresse für New York!! =)'
5,'Cannot go wrong here','Excellent time at this hotel, top service, centrally located 1 block from radio City and a few from Rockefeller Center.\r\nMake sure you upgrade to executive level, many perks including Continental Breakfast and better views.\r\nStayed in December to see the Christmas sights, and had four in the family, staying on the 41st floor (ex. Level) and paid just over $300.00 per night plus taxes (high in NY),, Look around, use the Hilton Honors website for best pricing..'
5,'Wonderful Getaway Experience','We return to the Palmer Hilton for an anniversary getaway as we had got engaged at this hotel in 1999. Once again from walking in the door to exiting on our last day, we were treated like royalty. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is exceptional in taking care of your needs. We were also upgraded to a Suite room and enjoyed the spacious room overlooking State Street. The lobby takes your breath away and the rooms have the character of an old world charm with all the modern day ammentities and expectations.\r\nThe location is perfect and only a few minutes walk to the majority of the things (restaurants, shopping, entertainment/theaters) that bring you to Chicago.\r\nWhen we left the hotel we accidently left our keys on the bed. About 10 minutes on the train to the airport we realized it and jumped off at the next stop. We immediately called back to the hotel and were informed housekeeping had found them and turned them into to security. Upon arriving back at the hotel, we were meet within a couple of minutes by security with the keys and were back on our way within 10 minutes. Now that is exceptional customer service and care.\r\nWhile a bit on the pricey side, we will definitely return to the Palmer for another visit and this hotel will continue to be our only choice when staying in Chicago.'

5,'Ottimo: pulito, grande, pratico, a due passi da central park e time square','siamo stati 7 giorni in questo hotel: veramente ottimo: stanze grandi, bagno grande, tutto pulitissimo, asciugamani venivano cambiati anche tutti i giorni se lasciati sul pavimento. Hotel molto grande ma molto silenzioso. Molto pratica la sua posizione a due passi da Time Square e vicino a fermata della metropolitana.\r\nConsigliatissimo!'
3,'Ok Stay at Park Central','The best feature of this hotel is its close proximity to Central Park, Columbus Circle, Times Square, and the Subway. The hotel lobby is beautiful, however I wish they would put the money into renovating ALL of their rooms. The room I stayed was an older one with scratched furniture. Housekeeping was also slow. Had to call them twice for extra towels and wash clothes.\r\nThey also charge a fee to hold your bags until your room is ready. This is the first hotel I\'ve ever stayed in that does this.'
4,Decent,'Good hotel. Let me check in early and check out late, front desk staff was helpful. Valet parking was fine, but we had to go around the block b/c we didn\'t realize what street we could access the valet on. Surprisingly quiet in room for times square location. Expensive, but company paid. If I was paying, would not be staying in Times Square but instead a boutique spot in the village probably.\r\nElevators were efficient and fast, but glass side and speed of drop made me dizzy.'
4,'City Noise','My teenage daughter and I stayed one night 11/2009. We were on the 17th floor facing Madison Square Garden and the train station.\r\nThe one negative about this hotel is the street noise. You can hear it loud and clear. Ask for a room in the back away from the street and on a high floor. The room was clean and yes the bathroom was small but I was not planning on speding a lot of time in there. TV was an old model, but it worked and we were not in the city to look at TV. Staff was friendly and helpful. They do have a locked room for your suitacases , if your room is not ready. Room was clean and somewaht outdated in decor. For less than $200 a night for 2 queen beds and a kitchenette it was well worth the money.'
5,'La mejor ubicación, excelente servicio','Cuando uno tiene un problema en algún hotel, a veces no hay que quejarse tanto, sino ver la capacidad de resolución por parte del mismo. Al hacer el check in nos dieron una habitación fumador, nada grato debido al olor conocido que producen las alfombras. Instantaneamente nos pidieron perdón por no tener disponible las habitaciones no fumador y nos dieron varios vouchers para utilizar en el restaurant del hotel, que siendo una parada conocida de los after oficinistas y por cierto nada barato (pero el que convierte no se divierte), fue una grata recompensa. No perderse de tomar por lo menos un trago en la barra del bar. Al otro día, nos cambiaron la habitación (y con mucho mejor vista), nada grave. Que decir de la ubicación, es magnífica en pleno Times Square, a distancia media de todo lo que se le ocurra a uno y más teniendo en cuenta la proximidad de las estaciones de subte, que funcionan bárbaro y combinando se llega a todos lados. El wi-fi lo cobran, pero esta disponible en las habitaciones. También se puede usar gratuitamente las computadoras en el hall principal (esta medio escondido en una esquina el business center, pero basta con preguntar). La habitación era de las más accesibles dentro de las posibilidades que ofrece el hotel, y no hay nada de que quejarse, el servicio de limpieza es un 10 y las camas muy comfortables. La habitación era twin como habíamos requerido y creo, creo que queen size (no llego a recordar, quizás eran king). en fin, grandes camas. TV, a quien le importa, estas en NYC, pero de todos modos funcionaba como todos los hoteles con mucha publicidad de tours, shows y vender y vender; y los canales estándar. Para el que vaya en auto, el hotel tiene una entrada lateral, mucho más cómoda y a pasos de las escaleras que llevan al primer piso y hall central del hotel. Si se busca lugares baratos para comer en la zona, en frente del hotel en la esquina hay una cadena conocida y no es la de los arcos, que es una muy buena opción para abaratar costos. En la esquina, sobre la misma vereda del hotel, en dirección a Central Park se encuentra un restaurant italiano con buenas pastas y no muy caro también (pero es mucho mejor hacerse una escapada a Little Italy, de una). Para finalizar y destacar el perfil servicial y ejecutivo sobre todo, del hotel, tuve que mandar un correo a otra dirección de EEUU y en cuestión de segundos lo pude enviar, obviamente con un costo(pocos dólares), pero fue una solución buenísima.'
5,'Visit The Palmer House in the Spring','Chicago is in FULL BLOOM in April with tulips everywhere. Be sure to visit Michigain Ave. with millions of tulips blooming in the median. The Palmer House was dazzling with displays of Pink Tulips EVERYWHERE. Huge floral displays in the Grand Entry.\r\nWHAT A SIGHT ! Bring your camera.'
2,'Average hotel, so so location','I chose the Affinia Manhattan among other suite hotels primarily because of its excellent tripadvisor rating and also because of the layout of the suites (the hotel website shows the one bedroom suite has the bathroom outside of the bedroom and just off the kitchenette and living room area. As I was travelling with my partner and mother-in-law it was essential to have the bathroom in a neutral zone!\r\nI booked 3 nights directly thru the hotel and got a somewhat reasonable rate so I thought. I then noticed a few days later on their website that the price went down for the first 2 days and called the hotel to get the lower rate for those days. On the new confirmation the 1st 2 days were lower but the 3rd day was at a higher rate than originally booked! I questioned this upon check-in (at midnight) and was told that the overall rate for the 3 days was still lower than the original booking!? I left it at that but should have spoken with the manager the following morning.\r\nThe initial room assigned to us 1806 had a great view but the bathroom door which was impossible to locate was right next to the king size bed and night table! Luckily the housekeeper (who was called to make up the sofabed) mentioned that there are rooms that have 2 bathrooms(!) so we requested one and moved to 2112. This is an old hotel (circa 1920s) and the rooms all seem to have different layouts. The 2 bathrooms were ideal for us despite being quite small. Aveda amenities are a nice touch. (A previous guest\'s pubic hair in the bathtub was gross but easily enough to get rid of.)\r\nDuring the night the street noise especially honking cars is loud and earplugs a necessity if you are a light sleeper. Windows are not tightly sealed due to the A/C units and were a tad drafty.\r\nThe 7th Ave/W 31st St location is great for shopping however its close proximity to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens also means an abundance of transients, young kids hanging about and undesirable characters at all hours.\r\nAffinia should provide a boarding pass service instead of telling guests topay $5.00 plus a printing fee to use the internet in the business center. It doesn\'t cost the hotel anything to provide this service and it would make it so much easier for guests who have a plane to catch.\r\nOverall I was not impressed with this hotel considering its very high tripadvisor rating. The rooms are okay, the location could be better and the service adequate. I will be back in NYC next year for exactly the same purpose but will book a suite somewhere else. The Affinia Manhattan sadly didn\'t cut the mustard for us.'
5,'Great time in Times Square','Our stay at the Westin NY was absolutly fantastic the service was great the rooms were really clean the staff was always helpfull if we had any questions or concerns. We could walk to alot of the NY City sites but the subway -bus station is right across the street. The location of the Westin is great with all the lights of Times Square right around the corner, serveral diners and restaurants within walking distance and of course Shulas steakhouse in inside the motel.This was our second stay at the Westin and will definitely stay again our next trip to NY City.'
5,'A Grand Hotel.','After a really dreadful flight with Virgin Atlantic (an over rated airline) the comforts of this hotel were most welcome. This was our honeymoon, so we were praying our stay went well, and it did. The room was fantastic, the maid service was super. The staff are a credit to the hotel, always friendly and warm. A spotless and clean hotel, situated in an ideal location. If you are looking for a trouble free place to stay, then you will not go far wrong at the Grand Hyatt. We spent 7 nights and would return again. But NOT with Virgin Atlantic, the return flight back to the UK was WORSE than the outward leg. Delayed flight, rushed service on board, rude ignorant stuck up cabin crew. If at all possible choose BA or a US airline.'
4,'Great Experience','We stayed December 17-20th, 2006 at the Grand Hyatt, and for the first time actually staying in Manhatten, this was a perfect location! The hotel room was beautiful, clean and the right size. The staff was very friendly and the location can\'t be beat. We simply walked downstairs each day to the Grand Central Terminal and were able to ride the subway anywhere we wanted to go. There is a great market iocated in the shops of the Grand Central Terminal and we bought breads and fruit and cheeses and had our own very nice breakfast in our room for two of the mornings we were there. Great coffee bar located in the terrminal as well, as the coffee in the lobby of the hotel was not good.\r\nThere were other times we wanted to walk to our destination and being so centrally located to Times Square, Rockefeller center and Macy\'s, this hotel was a breeze to get around Manhatten. I would definitely stay here again.'
4,'Nice stay at the Marquis','Came with a group of about 25 people, had 7 rooms. Rooms very spacious for NYC, clean, and fresh. Beds very comfortable. Arrived around noon, but could only check into 3 of the 7 rooms, the rest of us had to wait until after 3pm. \r\nHotel is very spacious and roomy. Didn\'t have to wait too long for an elevator, but be careful not to overload the elevators they will get stuck.\r\nI would recommend this hotel to other travels but only if you can get a good rate, which we did. Otherwise you\'re not in tthe hotel long enough to enjoy the extra money you are spending. The location was excellent, within walking distance to so much. Subways are also very close to use for longer distance traveling.'
4,'Un ottimo grand hotel','Si tutto come da aspettative il nome non ha fallito la catena hyatt e\'in tutto il mondo con ottimi risultati!l albergo e\'un grattacielo dotato di ogni confort dalla palestra alla SPA ai ristoranti le ascensori sono veloci e molteplici(in altri alberghi di new york ho aspettato ore per prendere un ascensore)il personale e\' tranquillo e all occorrenza gentile certo non aspettatevi che vi corrano dietro l albergo e\' enorme e pieno di clienti quindi non hanno l occhio su di voi il tutto e\'molto dispersivo ma questa cosa molto newyorkese quindi vista così la cosa mi sta bene!l ubicazione e\' abbastanza buona io che sono alla mia terza esperienza a new york l ho scelta per visitare un po\' la zona mid towen ma se volete un consiglio la zona sempre migliore e\' quella a ridosso di time squere specie se si hanno figli al seguito...'
5,'Fabulous hotel, staff were wonderful, couldn\'t have been better.','This is the first time I have written a review, but felt that we had such a brilliant time at this hotel, I should share the experience. The staff were so helpful, they ensured we had rooms next to each other, and made the whole vaction really special for my mother . The rooms had fantastic views, were spacious and always clean. The location was perfect so close to Times Square, easy to walk everywhere.\r\nWe all enjoyed eating at the Gourmet Deli just across from the hotel, also the Green Deli, where I found lovely Gluten free cookies. I can\'t wait to return to New York with my husband, and will definately stay at the Westin again.'
2,'Like a bad book with great cover art....','The good points first - great lobby, bar, and restaurant scene. Interesting ambiance, lots of personality, decent service with some wit and a little attitude - all good. \r\nOnce you get passed this - the functional part of the hotel is tired, cramped, claustrophobic, dark, worn, shabby, uncomfortable and depressing. My rooms was a closet. The bathroom was so small, you can barely turnaround. The flooring in my room was loose and had puckered in a way that when I walked the three or four steps that the room allowed I made a loud sucking sound. A small TV was randomly mounted in the middle of one of the side walls. While I don\'t watch TV, this seemed like a rather odd arbitrary design choice. Nothing about the cramped space seemed thoughtful or designed to make someone feel relaxed and comfortable.\r\nI suppose the defense of this design is that the price is supposed to make up for the lack of space and amenities. If they were charging hostel rates - this quality of room would be acceptable - but they aren\'t, not even close.\r\nBasic recommendation - if you are in the area, stop by The Hudson for a drink or meal - but stay in one of the dozen or so other hotels in the area where you can be comfortable.'
4,'Nice and Clean','We stayed here in July for 2008 to see a couple games at Old Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium. Upon arriving, we had to wait 3 hours for our room to be ready but once we go in, it was a normal sized room with a big screen T.V. Very Clean for what it was. Excellent location from everything you might want to do in NYC.'
3,Impresentable,'Es un hotel viejo con malas reparaciones. Imposible banarse con agua caliente, y las habitaciones son diminutas. De todos los hoteles que visite en NY....el peor.\r\nEl mejor de los detalles...me dijeron que tenia un cuarto con cama King al contratarlo..cuando llegue me entere que NO TIENEN NI UNA CAMA KING EN TODO EL HOTEL!!!!!!'
1,'This place is a dump!','All these reviews are right, this place is all about location. Be prepared when you go in to be deceived by the lobby. As soon as you get off the elevator you know you made a bad decision. Welcome to a scene from The Shinning. As you proceed down the hallway you\'ll pass door after door that look like coffins. The room instantly smelled like urine and the cigarette burned comforter was nasty. We took it off the bed immediately. The rooms are small and noisy. You can easily hear your neighbors. On the flip side, the staff was nice and friendly. \r\nNote: we did not stay in a renovated review.'
1,Avoid,'Hi,\r\nI stayed at the Grand Hyatt in NYC for a solid month.\r\nA customer was paying the cost so I should not complain too much.\r\nI had trouble sleeping.\r\nThey installed very strong door closing springs in the door hinges.\r\nThe springs are designed to close the doors HARD.\r\nI can\'t sleep through the noise of doors getting slammed shut every 10, 20, or 30 minutes. \r\nI\'ll try to avoid the Grand Hyatt (and other Hyatts).\r\n-moi'
3,'I resent paying for Wifi','when i can get it free in a bar around the corner.\r\nI am a hyatt member and have used many of their hotels - moscow, paris, milan.\r\nGrand Hyatt NY is OK. I had heard of big refurb but wasn\'t too impressed by it. The entrance looks grand, the bar is a little shabby already. Rooms ok size for NY as was bathroom\r\nService was very good however and any problems rectified quickly.'
4,'Explore New York City','Our room on the 11th floor had comfortable beds, a fridge, and lots of fluffy towels each day. Combined with a location on Times Square and close to restaurants and theatres, what else does one need for a great New York City experience......'
5,'HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!','I loved this hotel! And the staff was so awemazingly polite and helpful! After we left the Mansfield hotel this is where we checked in. And we could not be more happy! The rooms where, perfect, light, good temprature and big enough. The diner (Tick-tock diner) was awemazing as well! I\'m definitively going back to this hotel!'
4,ottimo!,'hotel oltre che centralissimo, ben servito da mezzi di trasporto, vicinossimo al macy\'s, ottimi i servizi all\'interno. I bagni lasciano un pò a desiderare, non sono nuovissimi, ma la doccia e i servizi funzionavano perfettamente, il fon era rotto, ma abbiamo avvertito e hanno provveduto alla sostituzione (le mensole erano ballerine...). Per una vacanza in cui prevedi di stare in camera il meno possibile ovvero solo a dormire o a riposare un pochettino il pomeriggio, va benissimo. effetivamente non è luminosissimo ma ricordiamoci che siamo a ny e in mezzo ad altri grattacieli... per quello che costa è ottimo. Perciso che va bene anche per famiglie con bambini, noi con il piccolo non abbiamo avuto problemi ci lasciavano dormire un pò di più la mattina e tardavano nel farci la camera. Alll\'ingresso dell\'hotel è presente un info desk per prenotazioni e per informazioni efficente più di un infopoint. Per la colazione ottimo a 2 isolati verso nord sempre sulla 7th il locale andrew\'s.... fantastico, ottimissimo rapporto qualità prezzo.'
4,'Hotel was great, would stay again','Just back from my first trip to new york. I stayed at the new yorker hotel on 34thst 8th avenue. Before my trip i checked out many hotels on the internet and couldnt make up my mind which to choose as some of the reviews were off putting. I reviewed the new yorker and wasn\'t a 100\% sure about it but then a friend recommended it to me, so hence i went on that recommendation. The hotel is really central to everything, the room was clean and the maids were in everyday to change the towels and bedding. The staff were really friendly as was the security at the hotel. They have a diner which is opened 24hrs and just across the road they have a 24hrs pizza place and mcdonalds. Penn train station is only a 5 min walk away and if you want to go to newark airport its only $12.50 where a taxi or shuttle will cost you about $80. There is a 24hr pharmacy on the corner if you need any medicines. From the hotel you can walk straight up to 42nd street where u will find times square on the right. Further up leads you to the designer shopping area and central park or u can grab a taxi for about $7. There are mass amounts of diners and restuarants to choose from. My average meal bill for two people including starter , dinner and bottle of wine was $120. I found the drinks to be quite expensive. I paid about $40-$50 for a bottle of red. If its your first time in new york and you are female---well my god your gonny love the shopping lol. I found new york to be pretty clean given the amount of tourists that are there. If you want to go to empire state building then go early in the morning to avoid the queues. The subway system takes a bit of getting use to but is a good means of transport from downtown to uptown. Once again if you are female and planning to use the subways just be alert. I probably wouldn\'t recommend using the system at night time. If you look quite young but are over 21 you will need to take your passport with you to get an alcholic drink. Back to the hotel facilities--- Clean , very friendly , helpful and staff are quite informative. You can book your shuttle/ taxi/ town car back to the airport from the hotel. If you need any more info on the hotel or whatever you can email me at-- redbarron123@hotmail.co.uk . Overall i would recommend the hotel as my experience was great. enjoy new york you will love it.'
4,'Very Nice','I wasn\'t sure what to expect since this was our first visit to NY. The Westin is in a perfect location if you want the NY experience. We never needed to take a taxi anywhere other then roundtrip to the airport. Subways are close by, Times square is right out the front door. The rooms were large, comfortable and had a fantastic view of the city. The house cleaning was not the best but not bad enough to complain. The check in was fast and front desk staff was very friendly. We chose many restaurants that were within walking distance and all of them were fantastic! The hotel is pricey and Shula\'s restaurant very pricey. There were several restaurants to walk to close by for breakfast etc. I would stay at this hotel again. It was just a lot of fun!'
4,'SIN LUJOS PERO RECOMENDABLE','he viajado varias veces a nueva york y honestamente recomendaría el hotel pensilvania por su inmejorable ubicación¡¡¡... no es un hotel de lujos pero debe recordar que en nueva york todos los alojamientos son costosos y este resulta realmente bueno en cuanto a su relación precio/ubicación, pues apenas caminando estás cerca de todo, en pleno manhattan... recomiendo reservar por página web las habitaciones del club penn, pues aparentemente son las que están más renovadas y esas son las que yo he reservado, por lo cual debo decir que el servicio de habitación en este particular es bastante bueno... las habitaciones son pequeñas (como es lo común en el estandar de nueva york) pero a mi me resultaron bastante óptimas y buenas en relación con la fantástica ubicación que es inmejorable, además que en nueva york es más el tiempo que se pasa fuera del hotel...'
3,Correcto,'Hotel con muchas habitaciones , por lo tanto mucho tránsito de gente , el trato es correcto pero escaso , eres uno mas del montón, a mi me gusta el trato mas ameno y en hoteles mas pequeños pero dadas las caracteristicas de este , no estuvo mal. Estuvimos en una suite , no muy grande pero con dos baños . Es un hotel de tránsito , muy bien ubicado , subte afuera , frente a la penn station, a pocas cuadras del empire state'
5,'Marvelous Stay','Stayed at the Westin Times Square for 1 night before and 1 night after a cruise. Beautiful room in a wonderfully located hotel. Walked to Times Square in just a few minutes. The staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. They seemed to like their jobs and were always serving with a smile. Beds were extremely comfortable and double-headed showers were refreshing. There was nothing to even vaguely complain about as everything was top notch. Will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.'
1,'This hotel was a traveller\'s worst nightmare.','I have traveled the world and this hotel is the worst. It took me 45-minutes to an hour to check in... the long line reminded me of the line to go to TSA security at an airport. The staff were rude and overwhelmed. There was so many people swarming the lobby -- day and night -- just like a train station or a huge bus station.\r\n The numbering system for the rooms is so screwed up, it took me two phone calls from a courtesy phone and 20 minutes for me to find my room on the third floor. The lighting in the hallways is extremely dim, the room doors were rusted and scratched and the paint peeled everywhere, and there was this foul, smell everywhere.\r\n Inside my room, I was speechless by the filth. The carpet was dark-colored and looked as if it hadn\'t been cleaned in ten years. The bathroom installations were rusted, the ceiling rusted and stained, and there was a huge plumbing pipe left underneath the toilet.\r\n The water was brown-colored and had a nasty smell, smelled like sulfur or some sort of foul gas. The view out of my window was dreadful. All I saw was a brick wall. \r\n The television reception was filled with static. There were no wall plug outlets available. The air conditioner barely worked and I looked inside of the vent and saw it was covered in grit, grime, mildew, paint chips and who knows what other filth.\r\n The bed sheets looked liked they came from a barn. The bed must have had micro-sized bugs because my skin became very itchy when I got in it. \r\n The front desk let the phone ring endlessly before they answered and rushed me off the phone (they sounded extremely busy).\r\n Internet is not available in the rooms. They have a business center in the lobby which requires you to pay by the minute, although WiFi was also available in the lobby -- for a charge.\r\n Bottom line: AVOID this hotel at all costs. It needs to be demolished.'
5,'modern comfort','This hotel is a cut above the rest. We received a great deal through the starwood website where we got our third night free. We were allowed to check in early and it was a breeze. Everyone we spoke with at the hotel was helpful and very friendly during our stay. Upon check-in we asked for a corner room and it was amazing. The whole room is full of windows, even the bathroom. And the view was the highlight. Don\'t be afraid to ask for a corner room, it\'s really worth it! The interior of the rooms were nice, the beds were comfy and the bath was spacious. I was very impressed with how clean everything was and the size of the hotel room. The location was excellent for our needs with 24 hour action just a stones throw away to Times Square. The subway is a minute walk away. I come to nyc about once a year and won\'t even look anywhere else after such a great stay at the westin. I could complain about a few minor things, but nothing worth mentioning. Enjoy your stay!'
3,'Trendy too far','We booked the Hudson through priceline because of the price, $105 for the night. \r\nThe Good: The rooms were as described here, small but clean and small is fine since this was New York. The bathroom was clean with very nice toiletries. We had a queen size bed which was comfortable. The staff was extremely nice and the location was perfect. Out the door to the left was a great little place to eat and out the door to the right was the subway station.\r\nThe Bad: The rooms and hallways are so dark that we (both lawyers) came up with this saying... They are one light bulb away from a negligence suit. Yep.. it was that dark. We wanted to read in our room but we didn\'t have a normal white light. We had a blue light, a green light, and some lights with creepy faces on it. I\'ve included some photos of the room and the lights.\r\nOverall, I would stay here again for the location. However.. I wish they would just put in a few lights!'
2,'What? 400.00 a night for THIS?','Okay. Granted, you are in New York City, but COME ON! We went for Westminster and stayed here 3 nights. What a waste of money. Pay the 400.00 a night and stay somewhere else. Cracked plaster walls. Beds that have mattresses that have not been upgraded since the hotel opened 100 years ago. NO INTERNET SERVICE IN YOUR ROOM. When we arrived - 3 people and 2 dogs - they tried to give up a single room. Not gonna work. So they did get us another room. Tiny. Outdated. Horrible beds. So what if this is the hotel everyone supposedly stays at when they come to Westminster. I certainly won\'t stay here again.'
1,'A EVITER !','Bien sûr la déco starckienne est époustouflante… Mais le service n\'est pas au niveau d\'un hôtel de cette catégorie : chambre avec un bruit de clim extérieure épouvantable, on a l\'impression de dormir dans une gare, air glacé sur le lit malgré le chauffage, d\'où l\'obligation de murer les fenêtres avec des oreillers, filet d\'eau tiède dans la douche, staff agressif et incompétent… Bref, cet hôtel ressemble à un cinq étoiles mais on vous traite comme des chiens ! Et en plus, on vous facture une nuit supplémentaire sans s\'excuser ! Allez-y pour visiter ou prendre un verre ! Mais c\'est tout !!!'
5,'great romantic stay which ended with a proposal','Me and My girlfriend stay at the hotel for a romantic evening to celibrate our two year anniversary of dating when we arrived check in was fast they send us to our room the first room we got was very small i am 62 and my legs were hanging off the bed so my girlfriend called down and the manager came up and gave us a bigger room which we were both happy with. The concierge lady i believe her name was maureen was very nice i had to ask her a question about my surprise that i had planned for my girlfriend and she said that the rose petals and flowers would be in the room at 9pm i said cool . Niles Restaurant next door to the hotel was excellent the food and atmosphere was amazing so we went to our show which was spiderman when we got back from the show my girlfriend open the door and see the flowers and rose petals and was in total shock then i got down on one knee and proposed to her she immediatelly said Yes. The Next day we got room service which was on time the server was very nice also the bellman who came up to help us with bags was also very nice and helpful we ask him if our ride was here and he went to check he said yes so all in all great stay thank you to everyone there my only complained is we got beer in our room and no cork screw came with it we had to call down for one.'
5,'If you love the big box reliability, this is your place','I hate the boutique hotels when I am on business in the city. Too much variability and too much hassle. When I go to NYC on business, I almost always stay here. The location is perfect, beside Grand Central, steps from the 456, right in the heart of Midtown. The rooms are small but aren\'t all rooms small in midtown? They are clean. The service is great in my opinion. The staff is kind and the concierge is knowledgeable and tries to help. Wifi is free in the huge renovated lobby.The elevators are fast. The gym is a bit lacking though and is always crowded especially in the mornings. I break meetings midday now and return for a quick workout. 5 out of 5 from me.'
2,'OK. Less grand than then pictures','Spent one night (thank God). Got out of the elevators and the room corridors were dank and musty. Oh Oh!! Room itself was OK. Bathroom and room clean but both had a very tired look - grouting coming off, veneer missing in room table. Had one small hand soap for both bath and wash basin. The elevators were inordinately slow - fortunately, I was deemed a mere mortal and thus given one of the lower floor rooms. For once I was thankful I was considered lower-than-Thou, and so I was able to use the emergency stairwell. Huge check-out line, so just gave my key to the concierge, so hopefully paid just the $ 230 (inc AAA discount). Massive $ 14 + tax for 24 hrs of internet - No-No. Fine for a night, but fortunately it WAS for a night.'
3,'Practical..For someone who\'s out most of the time','I stayed at the Affinia in October for 9 days. \r\nBig Hotel, hundreds of rooms but nothing great. A little bit old fashioned but under renovation. You don\'t need to set your alarm clock because the construction work will wake u up anyway...Thinking of sleeping in? Forget it.\r\nThe location was fantastic. Walking distance to midtown, chelsea, NoHo, TimeSquare . Right Across Penn Station. Restaurants, grocery stores everywhere. On the main street. I loved it! \r\nA few bad experiences but I would still go back. It\'s good value for money and I cannot stress how convenient the location was for me. Perfect base if you enjoy walking the streets of NYC.\r\nThe ladies at the reception were nice, but just for the heck of it. I wanted to ask one of the ladies a general question she totally dismissed me and said I had to wait in the long line where guests were checking in. It was just a general Question that would have taken a few seconds of her time.. However, when this other guy showed up from out of the corner and skipped the Q, she was very responsive. We waited an extra 5 minutes until she finished flirting.\r\nWhat annoyed me one night was when I was interrupted by this drunk loser\'s attempt to open my door at 3AM. He didn\'t know where his room was. So much for a good night\'s rest.\r\nI was not impressed by how tiny the bathroom was compared to the room. The room was SOO Spacious, I wish they could have used some of it for the bathroom. It was the size of a closet with lmiited room to maneouver. The shower was unbelievably small, I struggled every night. Also, the faucet in the shower was broken. \r\nWindow AC that did not completely cover the hole in the wall which gave room to outside air. What bothered me the most was that I could smell BBQ from the sharwarma grills down 12 floors!!!\r\nAlthough the buidling and interior looked oldfashioned such as the elevators, carpets, lighting,etc.. my renovated room was modern, Plasma TV, (all channels) art work, wall paper and lighting. No bedroom slippers. Lots of closet space. Like 2 closets and a whole study area.\r\nI am not sure how often my room was cleaned because I did come back to unremoved litter I left on the table (sometimes On purpose) and a spoon I used that had NOT been replaced nor washed for a few days. The towels in the bathroom were replaced regularly.\r\nIn general, it\'s average and uncomparable to modern boutique hotels that are filling up NYC. \r\nValue for money? Yes. I would check in after they\'re done with the construction work.'
4,'Economical luxury','July 20, 2006\r\nMy family went to NY for the first time and stayed here, it was a very comfortable hotel. Location was excellent , within walking distance of major tourist attractions. We would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again!!!\r\nTravelers tip: Do not book ground transportation through Golden Touch transportation.'
4,'No Broadband connection!','Chicago was mostly sold out the weekend I stopped so ended up here. On Exec floor, room was good and bed very comfy, bathroom small.\r\nHowever Exec lounge dingy and no view outside. Valet parking worked well. However no broadband! I was very surprised and disapointed. I thought all Hiltons had Internet.'
4,'Carmelo The Bellman','I had a great experience staying at the hotel, but i have to admit that the best part was to find someone who cares a lot about you as a guestt, that was Carmelo The bellman Did, i want to congrats him in public, because in big city like New York you\'ll not find people like him. \r\nThank you very much to did our experience in the hotel best and funn!'
5,'Superb hotel and excellent service','We married in New York and stayed 7 days at the Affinia Manhattan. We had a suite on the 26th floore with at huge balcony. We had 7 rooms for all the guests and they were all very pleased with the stay. The rooms where big and nice and the service from the staff was incredible!! Best hotel ever stayed on in the U.S'
3,'Good and Bad','This hotel really isn\'t too bad. The location is pretty central--a few blocks from central park, the time warner center and a few minutes from Times Square. The staff is friendly and helpful. The amenities are clean. The room we stayed in was just renovated so everything was new. It\'s not too spacious though and this was a suite room. The hotel is pretty busy so expect to hear a lot of noise within the hotel, whether it be traffic (streets) or people in the hallways/lobby. The walls are not paper-thin but I wouldn\'t say sound proof either. This is my second stay at this hotel. My first trip was the same neutral experience. Truthfully, the hotel wasn\'t really part of my stay much because I was out in New York most of the time and was only be in the hotel to sleep and drop my stuff (shopping) off. So if you\'re not picky, I would say this is the hotel for you.'
1,'Squallore e decadenza','Di clienti ne avranno sempre grazie alla location, quindi possono permettersi di non cambiare nulla nelle camere.\r\npro:\r\n1) location (anche se NY è visitabilissima anche facendo base in alberghi meno centrali, prima di andarci non avrei creduto)\r\n2) Vista dalla finestra della camera\r\nCONTRO:\r\n1)Camera Vecchia, mobili ammaccati, niente frigobar(!!!!!!!!!!!!!), solo il letto accettabile. Impianto elettrico da brividi.\r\n2)Bagno vecchio, l\'unica cosa recente sono i rubinetti del lavabo (casualmente nelle foto sul web), per il resto vasca ingiallita con tendina e doccia fissa sul muro, WC di plastica leggera scricchiolante.\r\n3)Pulizia a dir poco approssimativa.\r\n3)Prezzo altissimo per i servizi offerti.\r\n4)Scortesia di quasi tutto il personale, e grazie a Dio che parlo inglese.\r\n5)WiFi a pagamento (14 dollari al giorno!).\r\n6)Mettono fretta per di più senza scusarsi mentre si fa colazione (il buffet è nella media) dato che hanno una sala non sufficiente per la capienza dell\'albergo. Hanno 3 persone a servire e 4 a controllare non si sa bene cosa.girando per i tavoli.\r\n7)Lobby deserta\r\nNon lo consiglierei a nessuno...ci siamo andati per l\'ottima impressione che ci ha fatto il Crowne (the City) a Londra, ma tra loro sono come il giorno e la notte.'
1,'It really is a DUMP!!!','We booked last minute and alot of the hotels that received better ratings were booked up and if you wanted to spend 350.00 and up we could have found something better however we found a deal for the hotel at approx. $184.00 per night and thought well how bad can it be? It was bad. First the hallways are very run down paint chips dirty looking depressing. Then you get to the rooms with old brown carpets and paint chips marks on the wall dust on the windows. The sheets were clean and we got clean towels everyday some with holes but clean. We did try to upgrade our room but the rooms we were shown were no better and $50.00 more for the same depressing room. The staff are not very helpful they are probably tired of all the complaints they get. If you can find another place to stay you should. If not bring slippers so your feet don\'t have to touch the carpets and don\'t look under your bed!'
4,'Nice room near Times Square','This hotel is right around the block from times square and within walking distance of quite a few places. MOMA, Central Park, Broadway, ... it\'s an all around centrally located hotel. Room was clean and the staff helpful. There are vendor carts outside and restaurants literally all over the place. No free wifi. It\'s a nice stay in the heart of of downtown Manhattan.'
2,'Size does matter...sometimes.','I recently stayed at the Hudson Hotel in New York. My first impression from the lobby of the hotel was a chic trendy hotel, but when I got to my room I felt a bit like the giant Alice in Wonderland. I travel to New York often, and this by far was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. For example, when using the toilet, my knees hit the wall, and I am not unusually tall (5\'9). My bed was a queen, which had about 4-6 inches on either side. The room was, for lack of a better word, a shoebox. The room was also quite loud and I could hear noise from my neighbors and the hallway. I do compliment the hotel for using the vertical space in the room- however, there wasn\'t much vertical space to use. I recommend just visiting the Library Bar or the Atrium and skipping a stay here. You can find better rooms for your money.'
4,'Hotel bien placé','Le plus important quand on est dans une ville comme New-York, n\'est-il pas d\'en profiter un maximum à l\'extérieur de l\'hotel ? ... Donc ma critique tiendra compte de cet aspect. Hotel super bien placé, très bon accueil, chambre confortable.'
1,'Sty away','Old and dirty!!'
3,'Fine for an individual, but...','this wouldn\'t be my first choice for a hotel in New York City.\r\nPluses:\r\nThe staff was very good; friendly and genuine.\r\nThe location was incredible, less than a block from the 59th Street/Columbus Circle subway station. Just a few steps beyond that is Central Park.\r\nMinuses:\r\nYes, the rooms are incredibly small, even for New York.\r\nEverything is very, very dark. It got a little depressing after a while.\r\nI should note that I was at the Hudson through Priceline. I paid $160 a night for a standard room, which was close to half of the rack rate during my visit.\r\nI arrived late Friday night. Thanks to googlemaps, I knew what to look for, as the front of the hotel has no name or number showing (I was walking; if you were in a cab or car service, this wouldn\'t be a problem). The big yellow window across the width of the entire hotel made it pretty easy to find. The lobby is up the famous yellow escalator. It is quite amazing, with the moss or ivy growing across the ceiling. Unfortunately, it is directly next to the Hudson Lounge, with no wall in between. The music from the lounge made it necessary to literally shout with the woman at the front desk as I checked in. She would shout a question, and I would shout my answer. Not exactly a tranquil way to check in.\r\nMy room was on the 12th floor, so the noise from the lounge was not an issue. I was next to the service elevators and stairs (a result of reserving through Priceline?), but I was not bothered by noise from those, either. \r\nI\'ve stayed as some hotels with really small rooms, but I think this is the smallest room I have ever seen. The entire room is 150 square feet; there are large mirrors on both sides of the room to give the illusion of more space. There was really no place to put my suitcase; when I put it on the floor, it made it very difficult to walk around the bed. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was fine, but I am certainly glad I was not here on business. The room, even with all the lights on, was really dark. I tried to call the front desk to set up a wake up call, but the room was so dark I could not see which button on the phone was for wake up calls! I finally just punched 0 for the hotel operator. The desk in the room was so small, it really wasn\'t suited for any kind of work. Not to mention the lighting wasn\'t suited to working, either. I didn\'t have a computer with me, so I can\'t comment on the internet access in the room, for which there is a charge.\r\nThe head of the bed is up against the heater/air conditioner (as mentioned in other reviews). It was a bit loud, which didn\'t bother me, but I can see where light sleepers could be bothered. What I don\'t understand from other reviews are the mentions of the air blowing directly on people as they slept. At least in my room, the bed was lower than the fan unit, and the air was blowing straight up, so I don\'t understand how that could be a problem. The configuration may be different in other rooms, however. As to the air conditioner itself, it was not working very well the morning of my departure. I don\'t know, however, if that was my unit not working, or if it was the entire hotel. The outdoor temperature had been over 90 degrees for three straight days, so maybe the entire hotel was warm; I don\'t know.\r\nThe bathroom was larger than I had feared it might be, which was a relief. The products supplied were nice, and the shower worked well. I should point out there is a large window in the wall separating the bath from the bed area (to make the room seem larger?), with only a sheer curtain to block the view. If two people are sharing this room, they had better be really close! If you don\'t want to see your roommate using the bathroom, this probably isn\'t the hotel for you!\r\nThere were plenty of elevators, so I never had to wait long, but, oddly enough, they were very warm, uncomfortably so. Again, I don\'t know if the air conditioning was not working properly, but it was weird to get on the elevator and get hit with a blast of hot air.\r\nI didn\'t visit any of the bars or the Hudson Cafeteria, so I can\'t speak to any of them. I was planning on grabbing a quick breakfast Monday morning at the Cafeteria, but the line was down the hallway, and I didn\'t have time to wait, so maybe next time.\r\nAs I didn\'t have a computer with me, I was planning on using the business center to quickly check email once or twice a day. There is absolutely no mention of it on the website, but there is a charge to use the computers: $6.95 for fifteen minutes. On the plus side, if you want to check in for any air travel online, there is no charge to do that; the computers are set up to allow that without having to purchase time, which is a good thing.\r\nTo summarize, I would consider staying here in the future if I was visiting on my own, and could get a good deal. I would not pay full price for this hotel, and I definitely would not stay here with my wife, unless I got a larger room. But I should reiterate, the staff was wonderful. I had a lovely chat with the doorman as I waited for my car to pick me up. He had to be hot, and he was very busy, but he still chatted with me as he worked, which he didn\'t need to do, and I thought spoke to the effort the staff makes to please the guests.\r\nAll in all, an average stay at an average hotel.'
5,'Habitación espectacular','Me alojé durante tres noches en este magnífico hotel y la experiencia fue espectacular! La habitación era enorme con dos camas queen size super altas, cómodas y con multitud de cojines (un verdadero trabajo salir de la cama cada mañana)! El baño era precioso, muy moderno y con todas las amenities imaginables, incluido albornoz y zapatillas! Y como no hablaros de su immejorable situación a 5 minutos a pie de Times Square, rodeado de todas las tiendas, luces, teatros, bares y de más que Nueva York te ofrece. Atención muy correcta por parte del personal del hotel y muy limpio y cuidado en todas las instalaciones comunes. Sinceramente un gran lugar para hospedarse mientras se visita NYC!'
4,'Very Nice Accomodations, Great Location!','I\'ve stayed here twice, both in the fall of 2007. We had adjoining rooms both times and brought our kids. The location can\'t be beat! The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are a good size. We did not have any meals in the hotel, so I can\'t speak for the service or the food..... too many other options around! The front desk staff were very polite and accomodating. The bell staff could be a little friendlier! I had forgotten about their rudeness until I read some other reviews on here. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat! \r\nEnjoy!'
5,'Great location','This hotel is in a great location. Madison Square Garden is across the street, tons of pizza joints nearby. You can walk to Times Square. The hotel is clean and the rooms have mini-kitchens, which comes in handy when you want to take leftovers back and eat later. The staff is very helpful and I\'ve never seen a bug or a rodent there (unlike other NYC hotels).'
4,'Good overall but annoying extra charges and few amenities in standard room','The Palmer House is a very nice hotel, perfectly located for the Loop and Art Institute of Chicago (or walks along the lake and Grant Park). The people on the staff are extremely helpful and pleasant.\r\nIt\'s an older hotel, and the standard rooms are nothing special (although certainly pleasant enough). You can control your own thermostat, the beds are comfortable, and you get the things you expect in the bathroom. The TV in my room was large but old style. I was surprised that there was no refrigerator or coffee maker, but you can ask and get a coffee maker for free. (Well, they said they usually charge but wouldn\'t.)\r\nThe extra charges thing is a bit annoying. Internet works fine, but they charge for it. (They were having some problem collecting charges, so they gave me 3 free days--probably because they weren\'t able to figure out who was logging on). The gym cost extra. I guess these things are typical of more expensive hotels, but I don\'t know if customers should just accept this since cheap motels usually provide free internet and a coffee maker and often even some recreation space.\r\nThe walls were a bit thin, and I could hear when the next room turned on the water (but I didn\'t hear noise...maybe they were just quiet or else the walls did insulate sound).\r\nOverall, I enjoyed staying there. The Loop may not be the preferred place to stay for many people (restaurant scene in the Loop was disappointing...best places are elsewhere), but if you do want that area, it\'s perfectly located.'
4,'Just fine','All the reviews are very realistic. This hotel is in a Great location. That is undisputed in every review I have read. As for the contradictions...\r\n The rooms are typical Marriott rooms, excellent bedding, flat screen TV,nice bathrooms, clean and spacios.\r\n Yes I heard a toilet flush and a door shut but I hear that in my own house. I also heard \r\n the odd siren and I was 28 floors up.\r\n This hotel is so big that it is somewhat impersonal. The lobby is on the 8th floor and i saw it at check in and check out. If you are looking to meet new friends stay at the Cassablanca and sit around all afternoon and share stories. I have enough friends at home so I\'m not going to N.Y. looking for new ones.\r\n As for the elevators they are fine. I thought they worked very well as they are like express elevators that don\'t stop on every floor to let people get on and off. Some reviews think they are confusing but I think the people themselves must bet confused because it was very simple.\r\n The rooftop bar was just O.K. We went for a drink after the show and it was $8 a beer and $16 for a martini. At those prices I can\'t believe they have a cover charge for people not staying in the hotel. I guess thats why it was half empty. The decor here was mediocre at best.\r\n As for the gym it was very nice but we had no time to use it.'
4,'The reviews are accurate','The NY Hilton rates were the highest rate I\'ve ever paid for a hotel room. Was it worth it? Yes and no. As a child, I lived down the street from the hotel and it was part of my daily scenery. I therefore, attained a special satisfaction, staying there.\r\nThe room was spacious and clean, with all the fixings one would expect from Hilton. Checking in and out was quick. The personnel were pleasant enough. The location is perfect, close to Central Park, Times Square and the subway. I liked that we weren\'t IN Times Square where traffic is so often at a stand still. I liked that there was a curved driveway, where we could exit/enter a cab with out feeling rushed. \r\nFor $400+ a night free WiFi and breakfast would have been nice.\r\nWould I stay here again? Probably not.\r\nDo I regret having stayed here? No, not at all. I read multiple reviews and was aware of the pros and cons and it was exactly as advertised and reviewed.'
1,'Worst Three Star Hotel In New York. Stay Somewhere Else!!','I was in NY for business and my agent booked this placed. This hotel provides extremely poor customer service along with dirty room for a 3/12 star hotel. If I wanted bad service along with dirty room, I would have booked somewhere else for much less. After one night I switched over to the Novotel. What a difference!!'
1,filthy,'myself and three friends stayed in the Pennsylvania hotel for 5 nights! we booked two rooms and the first room we were given on the 13th floor was filthy dirty, the curtains were black with dirt, there were stains on the carpet and the room smelled even though they had the window open when we went into the room. So we went straight back down to reception and demanded that they change our room, we did get changed to the 8th floor, our room there was a little bit cleaner but not much. The wallpaper was stained from smoke and someparts were peeling off in the corridors. This is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in, we even saw some people had pets in their room which i think is disgraceful in an 18 story hotel!!!! the only good thing about the hotel is the location (5mins from Macys). I would not recommend anyone stay in this dirty hotel it is in serious need of a renovation. We had some friends visit us in the hotel and they said they stayed in a hostel in NYC that was nicer than this hotel.'
4,'Da conoscere','La hall la riconoscete .. Ci hanno girato molti films .. Con le sue piante rampicanti il parquet, il buio e l\' arredo antico in contesto moderno. Le stanze sono funzionali e minuscole come detta l\' ultima moda.. Paralumi design sui comodini, micro etto, microarmadio, microbagno.. Ma non ci si sente soffocare e c\' e\' perfino l\' asse da stiro.. All\' inizio ci si sente in Giappone e un Po di claustrofobia si fa strada.. Poi, una volta capito che e\' trendy ci si abitua e anzi si apprezza molto la praticita\' dei newyorchesi.. Ottimo lo spazio business e il cortile per gli aperitivi, molto sex & the city .. Un Po stolidi nella hall.. Ma cortesi..'
4,'Great lobby, room was small but clean and comfortable','We booked this hotel at a tour operator in Germany at a great rate. We liked it a lot. The room was small but clean and comfortable. We did not hear our neighbours or suffered from a small bathroom. Everything was fine. We had dinner at Potter\'s Lounge (a bar style restaurant) which was fine with good cocktails, burgers and salads. Ther lobby in art deco style is just amazing. The hotel is located within the loop and close to everything. It is just a short walk from the Art Institute and Millenium Park. We liked it a lot and will come again.'
5,'Great Place , great service!','Our family of four just got back from 3 great days at the Westin. The room was awesome (make sure to request a corner room, great view!). The service was great. The staff was always ready to help with a smile! The location is perfect. What else can I say?\r\nI would go back there, and would highly recommend it.'
4,'Luxury loved it','Fabulous place, rooms, location & views. Just off Times square. Stayed there for one night on a business trip. The modern, spacious and airy entrance set the tone for the hotel. The staff were courteous and my business companion was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite free of charge. There was a mistake in the booking but this was resolved immediately. The room I stayed in was on the 16th floor couldn’t fault it for a minute, everything was spotless and seemed new. The type of room that feels you were the first person to ever stay in it. Fantastic views over the Hudson river so much so I slept with the curtains open so I could wake up to the view.\r\nUnfortunately cannot comment on food or breakfast as had to leave early. \r\nWould love to come back here for a few days.'
4,'un sogno diventato realtà','Ho soggiornato presso l\'hotel pennsylvania dall\'11 al 20 giugno 2011 con mio marito, mio figlio, mia figlia e il suo fidanzato. Praticamente era una vita che desideravamo fare questo viaggio e finalmente quest\'anno siamo riusciti a realizzarlo.La scelta dell\'hotel pennsylvania è stata fatta anche in seguito al budget che ci eravamo prefissati, viste le tariffe inferiori che presentava questo hotel rispetto agli altri. Avevo letto le recensioni piuttosto negative riportate in internet ed ero pronta ad affrontare qualsiasi problema fosse insorto, visto il grande desiderio di visitare la grande mela!\r\nArrivati in hotel, il check in si è svolto nei migliori dei modi, personale qualificato e disponibilissimo.Le camere a noi assegante erano al quarto piano, grandi e spaziose con due letti da una piazza e mezza. La camera assegnata a me e a mio marito pero\' si presentava con il bagno non pulito e con la moquetta sporca....dopo una nostra lamentela abbiamo capito che la camera non era ancora stata riassettata. Usciti per un primo sopralluogo nei dintorni, al nostro rientro tutto era in ordine! Certo l\'hotel è datato, i mobili sono d\'epoca ma devo dire che le pulizie della camera avvenivano tutti i giorni, con asciugamani e lenzuola puliti.La sua posizione è ottima, si puo\' dire di avere tutto a portata di mano, l\'Empire è dietro l\'angolo, Time Square a 500 mt, metro\' e treno si trovano fuori della hall, e con la metro car puoi girare facilmente questa magica città .\r\nIl mio sogno si è realizzato e sicuramente ritornero\' nella grande mela in un prossimo natale, e soggiornero\' ancora presso questo Hotel!\r\nEmanuela'
5,'Tom the Concierge went beyond anything we ever expected','My wife and I Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square October 13th through October 15 and had a wonderful weekend with The great personal care given t us by Tom the Concierge Host at the front desk. Upon check in Tom was very friendly and had inquired as to our stay In NYC that weekend. We told him we came up from Atlanta to Celebrate my Wifes Birthday and upon hearing that he Immediately changed our room to a Corner room with Views of both Times Square but Also we were able to see the Hudson River and the Skyline of NJ. If that wasn\'t enough when we returned to our room after Dinner there was Both a chilled Bottled of White wine and also Strawberry Cheesecake waiting for us in our room all with the Compliments of Tom. In addition after checking out I had a need to print Our Boarding passes a few days later and Tom again came to my rescue and allowed my access to their Business Center so that I was Able to print our Boarding Passes prior to arriving at the airport. What can I say Tom made a great trip Fantastic. My greatest Thanks and Appreciation to Tom for his gracious Hospitality Sincerely Scott.'
4,'Great Hotel','On arrival the lady at reception was rude and unhelpful. She gave us our room key and I asked directions to the room. She told me to look at the card she gave me. I looked at it and said it has 2238 written on it but that doesn\'t tell me anything. With attitude she told me it was room 38 on the 22 floor.\r\nMy friend and I were staying there for 8 nights and we both had large suitcases. The room we were given was extremely small, there was just about room to wheel our suitcases in but no where to unpack for the both of us. We went back down to reception to see if we could change our room. On this occassion we spoke with a lady called Rayvonne. She was extremely polite and helpful. She gave us a much larger room with two bathrooms and was ideal for us.\r\nThe rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The hotel is close to all of the main attractions. \r\nThis was my fourth visit to New York and out of the other hotels I stayed at this one comes top. I would definitely recommend this hotel, but it was a shame that the first receptionist I spoke to was rude.'
5,'Best hotel in America!','If you are staying in NYC, stay here! Centered in Times Square has to be the best location. Although sleep can be a little hard especially on New Years! Great food and service, also very clean. Lastly, the elevators were probably what my kids liked the best;)!'
4,'Great Location and a Good Deal for the Location','Rooms are really big for New York Standards which I appreciated. I had a room with an anteroom separated from the sleeping area which I enjoyed. Although I booked very last minute I still received a room with a nice view from the 18th floor. This is a very large hotel so it was busy but I found that the front desk staff, management and concierges were able to answer any questions if needed. The room despite its very central location in the city just 2 blocks from the park was extremely quiet inside and the bed was very comfortable. ( I stayed 9 days).\r\nI need to disclose this negative aspect however and that is that a guest will be charged 14 dollars per day for vey weak internet access unless one is willing to spend their time in the lobby hoing to pick up a consistent W-Fi- signal. Most hotels offer this free to their guest in my travel experience.\r\nAs for the location it could not be a more central one and any provisions required are within a block o r three'
5,'Marvellous Marriott Marquis','Excellent hotel situated on Times Square. WE had an amazing view overlooking the Square and Broadway. The room was spacious, significantly larger than other NY hotels I\'ve stayed in such as Thirty Thirty or the Hudson. Experienced no problems whatsoever with elevators unlike some other reviewers. Everything you would want is in walking distance or just hail a cab.\r\nWould definately stay here again and currently first choice compared to other NY hotels'
5,'Comfortable and Convenient','I was very fortunate to land a very nice rate at the Crowne Plaza for three nights over President\'s Day weekend. The room I was in was terrific - well appointed, very large for NYC, great TV, a chaise lounge and an ample-sized bath with nice amenities. I had no issues with noise at all. Hotel staff was very pleasant and non-intrusive. Only small peeve is that the elevators are fairly slow, even though the two elevators banks are split and the elevators themselves are designed to be express It still takes time, especially during peak hours. Do note that there is a charge for wireless Internet. All in all, however, a really superb stay.'
1,'terrible hotel, avoid if you can','on returning from my stay i felt i needed to inform future goers on what they are gettin themselves into! the location is indeed satisfying however the hotel itself is a hugh let down and also some of our clothes( just bought) where stolen from our room! my reccomendations would be to avoid this hotel'
3,'Great Location','We arrived at this hotel early Sunday morning 7/8 and couldnt check in until 1:00pm. Took our luggage down to be held until we could check in and went to get something to eat and do alittle shopping at Macy\'s. Once we were able to check in the line was not long and we got our room in less then 10 mins. The room was really small and did need some updating but it was fine for us. My sister did have a issue with not having internet access in our room. If you are looking for a cheap hotel in a good location this is it. I would stay there again.'
3,'Not worth the price!!!!!!!!!!','The location is very famous,but because of this the place in front of the hotel is very crowded and almost impossible to walk with tranquility like a tourist in vacation.\r\nThe lounge employee is a rude and impolite woman that i talked in my entire trip,she forgot, her position there is possible because of a traveler like me,who paid almost $700,00 for a night,what a disgusting person!\r\nThe front desk act as a subway ticket sale person,with no pacience for nothing.\r\nWe paid for a times square view,but when we arrived in the room 75\% of our view is the back of the lighted panels and some old buildings,what a dirty trap!!!\r\nBe careful when book a room in this conditions,cose they send you to the oposite of your request!!'
4,'EXELENTE UBICACION','Impecable hotel, exelente ubicacion, impactantes vistas desde las habitaciones y confiterias, ya sea la del piso 8 y mejor aun la del 48.'
2,'OK For One Night, But Disappointing Considering the Cost','I have to agree with the recent negative reviews on this hotel. First off, I want to make clear that it\'s not that the hotel\'s quality is terrible, it\'s more so that the PRICE and star rating considering the quality is terribly deceptive and way off. This is considered (I guess) a four star, and runs over $400/night, and I would say it is really only worth $150/night. Secondly, the staff was really helpful in dealing with my problems. That said, if you really need and value a genuinely clean and modern establishment, these rooms might not be for you. Then again, it\'s a huge hotel with over 30 floors and I can\'t let my experience speak for all the rooms. The lobby looks like a palace, but the rooms were another story. When I checked in, the concierge was very polite and I happily went up to my room, only to wonder why the toilet seat was closed (they are typically open in a cleaned hotel room). I open it to find a huge amount of fecal matter and dark urine. I even decide I\'ll flush it and stay, but when I do that, it doesn\'t all go down and at this point I\'d need tools to clean the toilet. So, I went downstairs and the next staff person quickly provided me with a new room. This second room was also not clean. The toilet seat was down, but I was in no mood for anymore surprises, so I left that alone, but noticed that the linens were out of wack, soap had been opened with the wrapper left on the sink, and the cabinet door underneath the tv was open. A pillow was misplaced on the other bed (it looked like someone was laying on it, not like the cleaning crew accidentally placed it on the other bed) and the vertical throws at the bottom of the bed was missing from one double bed and placed messily on the other. I could tell this had not been fully tended to and went downstairs for a second time. The woman I got was really apologetic and put me in my third room. She apologized and gave me a coupon for free breakfast and beverages from the hotel\'s Market. I checked in the third room which seemed OK (it was cleaned by staff). I went to the gym and when I returned, there were complimentary (and yummy) chocolate chip cookies, a bottle of champagne, and a card with a lollipop that apologized again for my situation. I really appreciated the attention and it helped make a frustrating night better. As for the room, I was surprised at how aged it looked (I know it\'s a historic building, but judging from the lobby and prices and reputation of the chain, I\'d expected pretty on-point renovations). The carpet is sort of dusty looking and you can tell it\'s pretty old and kinda lumpy looking in spots, the bathroom is super small, and the doors (bathroom and closet) are old fashioned with a few small chunks of wood missing and paint chipped. I\'ve stayed in much better non-chain, cheaper hotels that have been beautiful, overseas and domestically. There was no fridge, so I had to throw my leftover Chipotle away. There was no coffee machine either. I called the front desk to see if there was a fridge in the building for occupants\' use, and was told that I could rent one for $20.00. No thanks. In the trash the burrito goes. I didn\'t take a shower because the shower floor looked a little dirty (not terribly, but I didn\'t feel good about going in there) and the drain was rusted. There was a piece of trash on the floor under one of the beds, so the floor hadn\'t been thoroughly vacuumed. My total was over $450 and this was under a reduced conference rate. I slept with the lights (and in turn, tossed and turned every other hour) on because I would bet bed bugs are in there and they tend to really come out in the dark. I expected free wifi, but the wifi browser was prompting me to pay. I could deal with it for one night on a business trip, but if I\'d have booked this hotel for a week for vacation with friends, I would have been highly pissed and frustrated. This hotel should make more investment in the infrastructure of the rooms. I was on the 17th, 24th, and 29th floor and can only base this on my 3 experiences. Location and views are great, and if you are easy-going hotel wise and aren\'t going to spend much time in the room, it\'s probably fine for you. But, I\'m sure there\'s better for less out there, nearby.'
3,Interesting!,'My husband and I stayed at the Hudson last week thrilled by the hotel\'s pictures. And honestly it was quite impressive, it\'s a very modern rustic designed hotel, the entrance, the lobby, the library/bar... However I read a review about the little light in the hotel that seemed somehow fishy... I remembered that review and totally agree, it\'s nice that the lobby, bar, etc is dim lighten but in the rooms you can barely see anything. Some room doors seem like someone broke into the room. it\'s weird. Plus it\'s not the ultimate cleanliness. But that\'s it. If you\'re a cleanliness freak don\'t stay in it but go have a drink or a night out. I totally recommend you visit.'
1,Unsafe,'During a one night stay two different people entered my room with key cards. One was housekeeping and the other was guest at 7AM in the morning after the Hotel checked this person into my room. The only response from the hotel was sorry, how about a free breakfast. I cannot imagine if I was a woman or if my wife was staying with me or by herself. I would not feel safe letting my wife, daughter, mother or any female stay there.'
3,'The average hotel in a good location','The hotel is well situated next to Grand Central. Station. Checkin fast, friendly and helpful staff. Problem is the rooms that need renovation. Old furniture, dirty carpet on the floor. Room dark and not very clean. The rooms are too small but that is standard for New York. So the hotel has a very good service, but requires renovation.'
2,'Keep on Looking','This was our first trip to New York City and I am sure that too many movies had set my expectations of the hotel rather high, but considering the star rating, I thought this was outrageous. There were only two things about this hotel that weren\'t a nightmare--the bellman that helped us when we checked in, and the location. We arrived around midnight with our two small exhauseted children and had to change rooms 3 times before we made it to one that was even inhabitable. They had touted a recent and expensive thorough remodel, and it looked like a dump. Filthy carpet, wallpaper peeling off the walls, filthy bed linens with cigarette holes and all in the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The first room was smoking--we specifically asked for non due to a severe allergy, the second room had a broken a.c. (hot and muggy in the room), and the third was still worse than any cheap road motel that I have ever stayed in when I was broke in college. Unfortunately we bid on the room through Priceline and were refused a refund so that we could change hotels. I made the mistake of letting the kids sit on the floor to color (we had to put the suitcases on the only table there was), their clothes were so filthy from the carpet I was afraid they would never come clean. The hotel is right across the street from Carnegie Hall--not that I could enjoy that---the little detour we had to take to find a room that was marginally acceptable forced us out of the room we were promised with a view of the street, and we were facing the interior shaft the hotel was built around--a very small open square with a view of the steam vents and other unfortunate guest\'s windows who shared the same fate. The restaurant was so overpriced we never ate there---roomservice was equally rediculous. I don\'t mind paying for good food in a quality hotel--this was not a quality hotel--it was an overcrowded barn for herds of unknowing tourists. A HUGE disappointment.'
4,'Very nice hotel','I think it\'s a very nice hotel. I stayed here for 1 night, the people are very friendly and helpfull. The room is nice, a little bit small, but who\'s staying in the room for the whole day when you are in NYC??? \r\nI am a travelagent and I will recomment this hotel to my guests!'
2,'Worn Out, Needs a Good Cleaning','Stayed here for two nights due to managerial recommendation. The hotel is one block away from our company offices, and a WHOLE lot less than the Hyatt down the street. \r\nIf you don\'t mind a 15-20 minute stroll, it\'s close enough to Times Square that all those tourist attractions are accessible. And there is a subway stop right at the hotel, if you prefer to take it down to Times Square. (If coming from Penn Station, you will need to transfer at Times Square.)\r\nSo far, so good. However...\r\nI really hate writing anything less than a positive review; but there were a few unforgivable attributes here.\r\nOn arrival I was assigned an upgraded room on the 18th floor. The room itself was spacious, which in NYC can be a rare feature. No problem getting into it either, because the door was ajar. This would have made me worry about my personal belongings after the staff cleaned; however fortunately I only had a couple of shirts.\r\nThe bathroom had a dirty floor (ground in dirt) and mildew around the tub. Both of these should be easy to stay on top of, so chalk that up to a management issue. Bed had craters in the mattress that were deep enough to cause a backache. This is a pet peeve of mine, and the Park Central was way into negative territory at perhaps the second or third worst craters so far this year.\r\nWould I stay here again? Not too likely.'
1,'Don\'t do it!!!!!!!!','This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If you have children and are considering this and looking at other reviews and thinking it can\'t be that bad, well it is. The hotel staff told me that it is going to be closing down and that is why it has not been maintained. We arrived at 10pm and if I had been able to find another hotel I would have. We only stayed in the room till 9am and went to our next hotel where we showered. Don\'t waste your money on this hotel (dump).'
5,'Old World Charm','One of my favourite hotels in Chicago, the lobby alone is worth the price, it has all the charm and character of the old hotel but with updated amenities. The rooms are simple but have everything that you need. There is a Starbucks in the street level so you don\'t even have to leave the hotel to get your caffeine fix\r\nThe location is close to State Street shopping (Nieman\'s Rack, Filene\'s basement, Macy\'s) and lots of restaurants nearby. Highly recommend the Atwood Cafe on Washington for their simple menu and Everleigh\'s Lemonade (vodka lemonade and fresh raspberries!).'
3,'Not a great hotel','This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel according to Priceline.\r\nI was here for two nights after spending 5 nights at the Omni Berkshire Place. Absolutely no comparison. The Hyatt is worn, loud, crowded, with less than stellar service. I was on the Club floor but was not given access to the regency club room. Ordered room service, food was not as picutred in the menu but tasted allright. Restaurant was closed upon checkin for some reason. Bathroom had no hot water at 9 am so I took an ice cold shower.\r\nFitness center was nice, and the lobby bar was pretty nice as well. Paid $110/night on Priceline which I thought was a good rate. Also, the location is good for families or groups - close to times square, the subway, and all midtown amenities.\r\nOverall, unimpressed by this property and I think it is not up to the standards I\'ve seen at other Hyatt hotels (Honolulu, San Fran, etc.)'
1,'Go somewhere else','I was in NY for a conference where colleagues stayed at other hotels such as the Hilton, Sheraton(s) and Marquis; the Park Central was the most expensive and had the least amenities (no coffee-making facilities in the room, Internet was $13 a day -- you can use the wireless network in the Sheraton for free). The service was dreadful; the key to my room didn\'t work on day 1 so after taking the interminable lift back to the lobby, the new key didn\'t work either. I asked a passing porter who checked the key and called security to help. Thirty minutes later they hadn\'t arrived so I went back to the lobby. I was told security were on a shift change. You get the picture. One day the internet wasn\'t working, the line I was given to call to check the problem suggested I get the hotel to give me a new cable. Down I went to the desk only to be told that there had been problems all day and they were aware of it.\r\nFor the best part of $300-a-day, stay somewhere else, you are wasting your money staying here.'
5,'Highly Reccommend..... Awesome Location','Stayed here with my partner from dec 15th - 20th in 08. Hotel is so easy find! Just ask for Madison Square Garden and its literally right opposite it. Only 2 mins to times square. After check in we went to our room which was on a high floor. Spotless room with big bedroom, big living area and decent kitchen but toilet was tiny and I mean TINY! It didn\'t have a bath and only had a really small shower area. I asked the guy at reception if we could get a room with a bath and he said he had a room on a lower floor but would rather locate us on a higher floor (less street noise) if we were willing to wait an extra day and promised us the room would be lovely. We opted to wait for the high floor and when we arrived back on day 2 from being out all day we were assigned to our new room which already had our luggage moved there by the staff. This room was fab!! No extra charge, massive bedroom with ensuite, massive bathroom. All you could ask for!! Highly reccommed this hotel. Clean, Helpful, Good value, Spaciousand very central.'
3,'A little run down...','I stayed at this property about 7 years ago on my last visit to NYC and thought it was a good value. The location is its best attribute as it is smack dab in the middle of Times Square and within walking distance of many attractions, including area theatres. However, this hotel is not what it used to be and is not a good value for the price. \r\nWe booked a club level room for $469 per night which is steep by most people\'s standards. The nicest club floor amenity was definitely the afternoon cocktail appetizers and drinks served in the lounge. The breakfast was ok but pretty bare bones. \r\nThe room itself was not up to par. The room was tiny and the bedding was ok, but not superior by any means. The bathroom shower drain did not work and was not in workable form the entire time we were there. I expect more for $469 per night. Upon arrival in our room, there was a letter stating that due to scheduled upgrades of the facility, it was possible that during most of the day there could be a man outside my window. How\'s that for privacy? Also, when I booked the room, I was assured that I would be able to get a late check-out on our last day and that was not honored. I felt that customer service was not adequate and neither was the room itself. If I had paid $200-250 per night, I would have been satisfied, but at the rate we paid, I was not pleased and will not return.'
4,'Low price, great location, free breakfast for $105!','We arrived by Tripper bus from DC at 10:30 pm on Thursday, 2/25/10. There was a long check-in line and two clerks. It took about 25 minutes to complete the checkin. Went to the assigned room and it had not been made up. Two phone calls and another 25 minutes later we were taken to another room. It had two double beds, not the king we had requested, but was a lovely, large room with a view of the street below. The TV didn\'t work, but a plug had fallen out. The next morning, the free breakfast was quite excellent. We were able to arrange a shuttle to JFK that picked us up at a side door of the hotel. We paid $105. Considering the location in NYC, we did not mind the small inconveniences we had experienced and would certainly stay there again without hesitation. We had asked for a renovated room based on advice in this forum.'
3,'un casermone a buon prezzo e a due passi da times square','L\'hotel è uno dei più antichi e tra i più grandi di new york per numero di stanze, in effetti da fuori è proprio un casermone....classico hotel da gita scolatica (in effetti era pieno di scolaresche), camere piccole, letto piccolo e bagno minuscolo......\r\npulizia delle stanze al minimo indispensabile anzi direi piuttosto scarsa la moquette era sporchina e l\'arredamento vecchiotto.\r\nIl prezzo però è stato buonissimo, 500 euro una settimana veramente poco....d\'altronde new york è una città da vivere e se vi basta un posto dove dormire e basta questo grande hotel fa per voi....inoltre è in piena manatthan davanti al medison square garden, lo consiglio solo a coloro che hanno poche pretese ma tanta voglia di vedere comodamente la città :)'
5,'Merveilleuse semaine','Situation IDEAL entre Time square et Central Park!\r\nPetit déjeuner buffet vraiment excellent et varié!\r\nChambre tres propre et jolies!\r\nRéception très moderne!\r\n10/10 sans hésitation!!!'
5,'Very clean and personal service','This is a large hotel that makes you feel special. My friend and I meet in new york 2 times a year and we will be going back. For xmas she is giving me my own black light and hotel cleaning supplies. I am very fussy, no need to be at this hotel. We were treated well and the front desk and staff were very helpful.'
4,'Great Location, Smashing Hotel for the Money','Located right next to Penn station for the Metro, opposite Madison Square Garden and a couple of blocks from Times Square, this is a great base for a sightseeing trip to New York. The hotel staff were really helpul and knowledgable and although there were 4 of us in a fairly small room, it was fine, after all there is so much to do and see in New York, you are not there for the room, it did the job. It was fantastic value for money, considering where it is and we asked specifically for one of the refurbished rooms having read reports on Trip Advisor and that was good advice.\r\nWould definitely recommend'
2,'One of the worse Hiltons that I have stayed in...','I won the Palmer House Hilton for a single nite during a Chicago visit. I bid $105 per nite for 4 star in Chicago Downtown. I got the Hilton Palmer House on Monroe for $105 plus feed/taxes per nite..\r\nAt checkin, they gave us (myself and GF) one double bed...which I know technically they can do (as that is all Priceline gaurantees)...good thing myself and my GF are not too big...this Hilton room had no view and room was smaller than Hotel Felix (where we stayed for 3 nites)...some wallpaper in room was peeling...bathroom ceiling was in primer...some rust on shower head...very old TV...bed pillows were bad....checkout was 11am...was not too impressed...was thinking how good Hotel Felix was compared to what Hilton gave us...though Palmer House does offer great location...Hotel Building itself is kinda neat..nice lobby...when at Hilton..it felt like we were on an assembly line...missed the personal touch of the Hotel Felix...\r\n..opps, almost forgot...few other things about Palmer House Hilton...you have to pay for Internet Access and you have to pay for the fitness facility...\r\nOverall...not much to like...'
4,'Very Nice Stay - But Unfriendly Concierge','Great location. We were welcomed by a very friendly girl at check in. Our room was very nice, much bigger than I had expected for a NYC hotel. The bar and restaurant were nice and offered a good selection, however quiet pricey!\r\nAfter our first nights stay two of us went down stairs to meet my husband who was getting information from the concierge. The concierge obviously did not know we were together and when my husband walked away from the desk this man who is employed I presume to help through his eyes up to heaven and made a face at my husband. I found this very unprofessional for a city centre hotel. On other occasions however there was a different very helpful man working as concierge. \r\nExcept for this one incident, the hotel was very nice with mostly friendly staff.'
3,'good location average hotel','overall experince of hotel was fine, staff were helpful but sometimes short with you\r\nrooms and hotel need improvement on furniture and decoration \r\nexcellent location next to madison square gardens and within walking distance from times square and the empire state building\r\none point i want to make is the bartender in the bar on the ground floor of the hotel was very kind and generous, gave advice on what to do, where to go and what to see. he also helped a friend when he had his bag stolen by cheering him up and giving the tip we gave him to my friend'
4,'Turns out to be super convenient location. Port Authority next door!','Big room. Great Bed. OK style. Kinda slow at the registration counter. Lots of food choices outside hotel...Starbucks, McDondalds 100 ft. away. Times Square is a traffic problem but think of it more as 8th and 43rd and you can get around really easily via subways and busses.'
3,'Sin más.','Bien situado pero el hotel muy normalito. Te cobran 14$ por cada dia de wifi, cuando cualquier cafeteria te lo da gratis. Vergonzoso.\r\nFaltaba una hora para q vendrian a por nosotros, pedimos q nos guardaran las maletas. 3,75$ por maleta. \r\nLas vistas desde nuetra habitacion nulas. Daba a una especie de patio.\r\nLa bañera no tragaba. \r\nLa limpieza justita.'
4,'Top Hotel in bester NY-Lage','Dieses Stadthotel zeichnet sich durch einen hervorragenden Service und für NY-Verhältnisse großzügige Zimmer aus. Fußläufig können die meisten der Attraktionen in NY gut erreicht werden und durch die direkte Anbindung an den Zentralbahnhof Grand Central Station besteht eine ideale Verbindung zum U-Bahn- und Fernbahnstreckennetz. Die große Hotellobby ist an heißen Sommertagen zudem einer der kältesten Orte in NY. Der Fitnessbereich ist im obersten Stockwerk eingerichtet und bietet neben allen gängigen Geräten einen wunderschönen Blick über die Dächer NY\'s.'
1,'Worst hotel experience ever! Bed bugs!','We have stayed in many hotels and have never had an experience like that at Affinia.\r\nFrom the onset we were disappointed with the overall shabbiness and dated decor of the hotel. \r\nOur room was spacious and the bathrooms were clean, but the carpet was filthy, window sills were badly chipped and wallpaper was yellowed and ripped. The hallways were extremely dingy.\r\nWe booked our room with Expedia for two adults and two children. Our room only accomodated three people. We declined the offer to pay an additional $32. for a cot and decided to put one of our children in our bed and the other in the single pull-out couch. \r\nHowever, there was no bed linen for the couch. After two phone calls and an hour later, linen arrived. After using this linen, our daughter woke in the middle of the night covered in a very severe case of bug bites. \r\nWe were assured by the front-desk manager the next morning that all linen would be changed and a cot would be provided.\r\nYet, when we arrived back to the hotel later that night this had not been done. Again, it took two phone calls and over an hour before we received linen. This was extremely inconvenient as we had young children who needed to go to sleep. Our only compensation was a free breakfast.\r\nIn addition, our iron did not work, the elevator was not working and we had to carry our suitcases down the stairs and sirens from a near-by fire station went off all night.\r\nI do not recommend this hotel and am very surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has received on this site.'
4,'terrific location/beautiful large rooms','I stayed one night here recently during a business trip and will definetley return.\r\nMain perks: self-parking garage is very convenient; great location to get on highway quickly/with ease; huge rooms; many dining/lounge options in hotel; comfortable bed; nicely appointed rooms.\r\nI found a great deal on priceline. I would return on a future trip.'
3,'Gute Lage, typisches US Hotel, dass in die Jahre gekommen ist','Der Eingangsbereich ist beeindruckend. Das Hotel hätte sicherlich viel Potential, wenn man mehr ins Unterhalt stecken würde. Leider sind die Zimmer zwar riesig, aber nicht sehr schön. Das Essen war mittelmässig und ich hatte ein Zimmer mit Verbindungstür. Die Lautstärke des Nachbarzimmers war deutlich zu spüren.'
1,'Ruunnn foressstt rrruuunnn!!!','I just checked I\'n today this hotel looks more appealing from the outside the inside is outdated rooms are small I just found dirty towels bathroom looked dingy paint is chipping on the walls room doors look like jail cells carpets are dirty .. Walls are squalid .no inernet I\'n rooms .overall looks like an old welfare prostitution camp and just think I have two night uuggh smh!!'
5,'Great Hotel in center of Times Square','Hotel staff friendly and efficient. Great lounge overlooking Times Squares serving good drinks and food. Good breakfast bar and The View restaurant is excellent!'
3,'Great location','The location is what is great about this hotel. A nice feature was that the double/double room also had a pullout couch in the room for an extra guest. There is really nothing else special about the accomodations.'
3,'Great location, but...','The best attributes of this hotel were its location and lobby...Other than that, not sure I will stay here again. Not sure what I was expecting, but the rooms were dated and dirty. While looking for electrical plugs, I pulled out the bed and there was an inch of dust on the baseboards. If you need more than 1 electrical outlet next to the bed, you may want to pack an extension cord. Staff was courteous and helpful, but seemed overwhelmed at times with the tour groups checking in/out. Overall, the room served our needs since we didn\'t spend much time there.'
5,'Nice hotel in great location','Our family of 4 stayed July 31-Aug 2, 2009. The location was ideal for us- close to Subway, Times Square and Broadway. It was my third trip to NYC and this hotel was the best by far. We had ample room and a great view. The beds were super comfortable. We didn\'t hear or see many others on our floor yet we know it was full. We were on the 40th floor and never waited more than a minute for the elevator. It was nice to have a safe in the room to store valuables. We had a slow draining shower which was fixed on the second day without us complaining (I wanted to but didn\'t get around to it). The only thing I didn\'t like was the sliding glass door to the bathroom- frosted glass which let all of the light through-at night more of an issue- and was not soundproof. Also not much counter room in there. No pool in the hotel, but we were so busy my young teenagers didn\'t mind at all. The restaurant is very expensive but has great food, especially the steaks and of course New York Cheesecake. Expect to spend $50 per person if eating dinner. The Europan deli/bakery on the corner is very reasonable and has great food, fast service too.'
5,'Excellent location','Lovely hotel in middle of Times Square, the hotel was spotless and the staff professional and very helpful with luggage, getting taxis etc, amenities very good in general , will stay again !!!'
5,'Beautiful hotel','We stayed at the Palmer House to go shopping and see the aquarium in Chicago. It is located directly between the two although the walk is a little long for both. The hotel lobby is beautiful and all the staff seem nice. We got the package with the aquarium tickets so the room was not anything special but it was clean and we didn\'t hear any other guests while in our room. The only problem was that the elevators from the rooms down to the lobby take a very long time. At first I thought they were broken and just took the stairs down 16 floors.'
5,'Westin Just Wonderful','You are in Times Square but away from the mad crowds on Broadway. You can walk to the best shows and restaurants and your concierge will direct you there. We had just the best stay in New York and the people at the Westin made it even better. \r\nThe staff in Shulas became friends after one or two breakfasts. Loved it.'
4,'My 2012 Stay At the Park Central','I am very impressed with the Park Central had a great rate, room was very good staff was A+\r\nCarolin at the front desk was awsome gave us great things to do around the city, helped me out with my client she was awesome overall great hotel'
4,'Great location!','Perfect location, close to the subway, great room. Most of the staff was very friendly and the concierge desk was so helpful in obtaining information about the city and what we could do as well as directions. The hotel was extremely busy at the time of our stay and we had a few issues trying to get a roll away bed and extra blankets the first night but after that everything went really well. The attendant at the front desk when I checked out was extremely friendly and inquired about my stay and the frustrations that we did have. His helpful demeanor and friendly attitude helped me leave with a better attitude about this hotel stay. His name is Ricky. He was the difference between me giving this hotel a 4 rating instead of a 3 rating. I would recommend this hotel to everyone now!'
5,'excellent hotel','Really excellent hotel, spent 5 nights here in Nov 2010 had a great experience. Excellent location right on times square, staff were very friendly. Rooms are pretty good, we had a corner room on the 39th and it had excellent views of time square, got a good nights rest each night, no real noise but you are on times square so you will hear the odd siren etc. We will be going back.'

4,'Nice weekend getaway!','Great Manhattan location, especially if you are seeing a show on Broadway. The rooms were clean and while not spacious (it is Manhattan, after all) plenty big for the two of us. The bar has delicious martini\'s and the staff at the hotel was very nice. (And we were there just 4 days after Hurricane Sandy).'
5,'Excellent stay','Booked a last minute deal with hotel direct and was pleasantly surprised by Hilton.\r\nI arrived at 1:45pm ahead of the 3:00pm check-in and this wasn\'t a problem. As I had booked only the day before I got a good rate, but for a basic room. The lady on the front desk very kindly upgraded me to a king deluxe that was one of the newly refurbished rooms.\r\nRoom was of a very good size for NYC. Not at all cramped, had ample drawer space and wardrobe space. The king sized bed was probably the most comfortable I\'ve slept in. \r\nDrinks in the bar are priced as most hotel bars are, verging on expensive. I didn\'t eat in the restaurant, but did have a nacho snack in the bar that was very good.\r\nLocation is excellent.\r\nWould definitely stay again.'
4,'Great location and Staff but Pricey!','We stayed only one night but the rooms were really nice and the location great. More importantly the staff was excellent - from Sandra Esp at the front desk who really made us feel welcome to Mike at baggage check who gave us a great breakfast recommendation, to our unnamed but funny bartender who made a mean vodka tonic. If we could afford it we\'d be back next weekend'
5,'Oasis in times square','Great hotel, great room - we paid for one of the newly refurbished deluxe rooms. The view we had from the 33rd floor was amazing - times square from one window, harbour from the other. Despite being so close to times square the room was lovely and quiet and we had no problems sleeping. All staff were friendly and helpful. This was our first trip to New York and we\'d heard lots about the quality of hotels - this hotel beat our expectations. Lots of quality facilities - gym, swimming pool, bar, restaurant. Would definately return to this hotel.'
5,'Enjoyed My Stay at the New Yorker','Convenient location, great service, all the amenities. My first trip to New York was a pleasure staying here. Close to subway, friendly and attentive staff, consistently clean room. Bar/restaurant, diner, business center, fitness center, and coin-op laundry all on site. I would stay here again and recommend it to others.'
4,'Location A+, Rooms C','It could not be in a better location for soaking in all of the glitz and glamor of Times Square. Incredibly convenient. The guided tour stops are within a block either way, plus it is surrounded by great restaurants and shops. \r\nThe hotel itself was absolutely clean, well maintained, and the lobby is gorgeous, but this is definitely a value oriented hotel. The interior halls on the upper floors were not air conditioned and the elevator service was slow. We also had issues with our accommodations - promised 2 rooms with 2 double beds but ended up with 2 twins and couldn\'t move. One of our bathrooms required a step up to get into it which some may consider charming, but others may have an issue with. Beds were not comfortable.'
5,'Great location','Very much loved the location. I enjoyed it because my friends and I could walk around the city and everything was close by or within reach. I also loved the staff was very nice and helpful with our maps and helping us get to our spots. I loves my room it was sooo lovely I had an amazing stay!'
4,'Just right!','This hotel was in a perfect location. Some of the staff were a little unfriendly but in contrast others were very helpful. The only thing I would fault is the carpets were a little dirty and the wallpaper was peeling. We were given a smoking room when we requested a non-smoking but they happily moved us to a much better room the next day.\r\nAll the cafes around the Hotel are great. For shopping I definitely recommend Soho, we made the mistake of sticking around 5th Avenue which is much more expensive. We discovered Soho on out last day so if you\'re there for shopping go there first! H&M is brilliant - they have 2 and it\'s all so cheap it\'s unbelievable.\r\nI also recommend the Sex and the City Tour if you like the programme, it\'s so much fun and you see a a different side to New York.\r\nI had a great stay, loved the food, the people, the hotel, the atmosphere. Definitely recommend this Hotel!'
4,'Great location, nice and spacious rooms, noisy','We stayed for 5 nights in this hotel on a NYC trip with a girl friend. We chose the Affinia Manhattan because rooms seemed larger than the usual NYC standard, for its location and affordable prices.\r\nIn most ways, we were not disappointed. Service was excellent and very attentive and we were impressed with the friendliness of the staff. There was one exception with one of the doormen who was rude, but for the others, nothing but positive feedback. Our one big disappointment was that we had asked for a quiet room (several times by mail, and when checking in), and ended up on the 4th floor, in a room overlooking 7th avenue (reception had told us, wrongfully, that the room was on 31st street). The traffic was constant, with horns and sirens, going on at any hour of the night and day, as if the window was wide open! Unfortunately, by the time we realized how noisy it was, it was too late to switch rooms (didn\'t feel like packing and unpacking again).\r\nThe room itself was large for NY standards, and completely refurbished in a tasteful manner. The bed were very confortable, and there was also a fridge and a large flat screen TV. The bathroom was however very small, but clean and well appointed, with nice bathroom amenities.\r\nWe didn\'t sample the fitness room, but were told that it\'s open 24/7.\r\nAnother thing not perfect was that sometimes, the Concierge desk did not seem completely knowledgeable of the area, but they were always nice and trying to be helpful. They also have a computer on their counter, which you can use to do your airport check-in and print your boarding passes, which is great. They also have a scale available to weigh your luggage to ensure you comply with airlines regulations.\r\nOne area to improve would be the internet access. For this price and hotel category, you should definately have free Wifi\'s in the rooms, or at least in common areas. We just went to the Starbucks across the street, as the 15$ tab for a 24h connexion was ridiculous.\r\nIn summary, very nice hotel, lovely decoration, attentive staff, however, if you have an issue with noise, to be avoided.'
4,'great times square location, at a reasonable cost.','After 3 nights at the Waldorf Astoria and a week in Florida, we tried the Affinia, mostly due to its proximity to Domntown Manhattan.\r\n While certainly an older hotel, it was clean and has a wonderful staff. we had a suite for $159.00, and right next door to the hotel is a deli with resonable prices on some really good fare, along with a variety of tinned and frozen goods for those that have grown tired of eating out. Penn Station Madison Sq Gardens, Broadway, Empire State and Rockerfekker Center, just a few short blocks away at most.\r\nCan be noisy at night, but thats NYC!'
4,'Hôtel idéalement placé, mais le service laisse à désirer','L\'hôtel est remarquablement placé à Time Square. Il est possible de se déplacer à pied dans de nombreux endroits (dont Central Park et la 5th Avenue). La chambre est très standard pour un prix un peu surfait. Alors que la réservations été effectuée en mars pour un séjour début août de 3 nuits, on nous a indiqué que la chambre promise n\'était pas disponible le premier soir (arrivée à 23h30 totalement crevés).! Après maintes discussions \r\navec le front desk, on nous a envoyé le manager qui est venu les mains dans les poches. Pour le désagrément, on nous a proposé une réduction de USD 30 et un petit déjeuner offert! Ridicule! En insistant énormément, il a été possible de touvé, ô miracle, la chambre prévue. Petit désagrément qui nous a pas empêché d\'apprécier une ville FANTASTIQUE! Par contre, plus jamais dans cet hôtel par principe!'
5,'Super Lage und grosse Zimmer!','Das Crowne Plaza ist ein wunderschönes Hotel, die Lage DIREKT am Times Square ist super!\r\nBeim Frühstücksbuffet kann man direkt auf den Times Square sehen - einfach wunderbar!\r\nDie Zimmer sind für New Yorker-Verhältnisse sehr gross, wir waren sehr überrascht!\r\nEs ist sehr sehr sauber und das Badezimmer ist sehr modern eingerichtet.\r\nWir würden wieder in dieses Hotel gehen, wenn wir in New York wären.'
5,'best hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!','i would just like to say that this hotel was a great surprise!after reading the awful reviews about it on this website i was very nervous!however the hotel turned out to be excellent.the location is excellent, you step outside the door and madison square gardens is cross from you and macys is beside you. it was easy to walk to all the different attractions in new york!the hotel was very comfortable. the only problem is that the hotel is a bit dated but at the end of the day who cares!the beds were very comfortable and the shower always had piping hot water. i must say i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and i would highly recommend it. i am planning on going back to new york nxt year and i will defintly be staying in this hotel again!!!!!!!!'
3,'Nice Stay, Nice Surprise','The front desk staff was very nice and helpful; they let us check in early although check in time was 3:00 we got our room key at 12:00 noon. The gentleman at the Help desk was not so friendly and they checked your room key every time before they would allow you to board an elevator. The first impression of the hotel is big and nice, but old. The carpet throughout the Hotel needs to be updated. I asked for a room on a higher floor with a city view. We were granted a room on the 33 floor which was very nice. Our view was from the back of the hotel and overlooked the River. This was not a City View, but we were happy. The room itself was big enough for 3 people to move around with comfort. The bathroom was small, but met our needs. The Beds were very comfortable and two pillows for each person. Our room had two double beds, a desk with chair, and a bedside table between the two beds. We had a new Flat screen large TV, which was on a dresser with three drawers. There was also a Closet space for storage of luggage and totes, also a place to hang clothes. The room also came with a full size Ironing board and full size Iron. Fresh towels and toiletries were put in all three days of our stay. Our Blow Dryer in the bathroom did not work and sparks flew when it was turned on. I reported this to the help desk and they sent someone up right away while we were out. Upon our return, we noticed the Blow Dryer was taken off the wall mount and there was not one in replace. I then noticed I had a voicemail on the phone and got a message from the housekeeping staff saying the Blow-dryer was broken and they did not have one to replace at this time. This left two women without a blow-dryer and we did not pack one because we knew there was one in the Hotel Room. \r\nOver all, we had a pleasant stay at the New Yorker Hotel. We ate 2 times at the Tick Tock diner. The food was average and nothing to brag about. There was also a McDonalds Fast Food across the street from the Hotel. They also have a business center where you can use one of four Computers and are able to print, but beware it is not free. They require you to scan your credit card before it will allow you to get on the computer. If you print it will charge your card $.25 per copy. Over all this is a good hotel to stay in the city. Walking distance too many of New York’s tourist attractions. I would recommend the hotel to a friend.'
2,'Une étoile, et encore c\'est bien payé !!!','La chambre n\'est pas plus grande qu\'une chambre F1 . Le service n\'est pas meilleur.\r\nLe plus désagréable est le BRUIT !!!!! Bien qu\'au 19é étage, on a l\'impression d\'avoir les fenêtres ouvertes. Attention, il s\'agit d\'un établissement pour jeunes , musique sur les terrasses jusque 02h00 du matin !\r\nLa seule chose positive est l\'emplacement de l\'hôtel....\r\nJ\'ai lu précédement, plus jamais ; effectivement c\'est mon sentiment aussi. C\'est dommage car N-Y est super'
4,'Atendeu as expectativas','Hotel limpo e organizado. Funcionãrios prestativos e atenciosos. Restaurante 24horas no lobby do hotel bem variado e com bom atendimento. Hotel bem localizado, dois quarteiroes da Macy\'s e uns tres quarteiroes da Times Square. Proximo a um Starbucks e uma farmacia. Fiz vãrias compras pela internet que chegaram antes de mim e o Hotel guardou tudo sem custo adicional.'
5,'Close to Times Square and huge room!!','Stayed at the Westin Times Square Aug 12 - 15 2005 and had no complaints at all! We got there at 10:00 AM and they got us right into a room!! The room was spacious and clean and the bed was sooo comfy! After a hard day of walking and shopping, falling into a soft comfy bed was the perfect ending to a perfect day!! The shower was huge and lots of water pressure! Never heard the street below or the neighbors!! The hotel is less than a block away from Broadway and right around the corner from the subway! One day we walked to Pier 83 to catch the circle cruise and it only took us 15 or so minutes to get there. I would highly recommend staying here!'
1,'Horrible Nos Robaron !!','nuestra estadia fue de 4 dias en el mes de agosto del 2012 .\r\nla habitacion es una caja de zapatos ... solo hay espacio para la cama y tiene espejos a los costados para que no te agarre un ataque de claustrofobia , el baño lindo pero pequeño , y hay un rincon para colocar las maletas y apoyar pertenencias junto a la puerta , ahi estaban 2 bolsas de unas compras que hicimos en el mall que esta en frente del hotel pero cuando quisimos guardarlas en las maletas para irnos el ultimo dia esas bolsas desaparecieron.Nos quejamos ,luego de una larga charla con el encargado de seguridad nos dijeron que nos llamarian despues de investigar el asunto, pero solo recibi un mail diciendo que yo debia llamar a zurich seguros para hablar de lo acontecido , nada mas.\r\nel desayuno en la libreria es malisimo sale $21 usd mas tax y era un desayuno continental (mas pobre que en cualquier hotel barato de orlando ) que si pedias un capuchino u otra bebida que no sea el cafe regular te lo cobraban aparte .\r\nen los pasillos hay maquina de hielo, bebida y snaks pero en nuestro piso este ultimo no funcionaba.\r\npara rematar un empleado del valet parking le ofrecio drogas a mi novio.\r\n lo unico que rescatamos es el diseño del hotel y la ubicacion .'
5,'Perfect trip, Perfect location, Perfect hotel :)','Stayed here December 2009 for 5 days, having stayed there previously had really high expectations and The NewYorker lived up to everything we had imagined . . . Our room had a beautiful view of the Hudson River which we had requested. The room itself was nicely decorated and the bed was really comfy :) which was perfect after a long day shopping!\r\nThe trip to Woodbury Commons is a must do! Its filled with great bargains but remember if you love to shop bring an empty suitcase so you can fill it with all your purchases and dont have to buy an overpriced one there like I did!! For the best views of the city go to Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center), views are brilliant and unrestricted from every angle absolutely FANTASTIC!!!\r\nThe hotel is located right in the middle of everything across the road from Madison Square Gardens, a block away from Macys and literally a 5 min stroll to the shops on Fifth Avenue. \r\nThe Tick Tock Diner located within the hotel is great for a full breakfast and snacks throughout the day. The staff are really nice and friendly and work really hard as it does be quite busy! It is also really cheap and the food is good with a great selection for even the fussiest of eaters!\r\nThe staff in the hotel are really nice and courteous and the cleaners do a great job in the rooms! The only flaw I would have with this hotel is with the Safety Deposit Boxes . . They are located behind the front desk but you have to queue behind all the check in/check out guests which can be very frustrating at busy times of the day. . I think they should either have a staff member designated for this area with a seperate queue or put safes in the rooms!\r\nAll in all though the hotel is a fantastic place to stay, great location, very safe and would recommend it to all . . cant wait to go back :D!'
4,'Good location','Pros:\r\nThe location - 15 minutes walking from the Times square, close to a subway station\r\nThe room - we took the suite which was big enough, very clean and cosey\r\nInfo - there is a tourists info right at the middle of the lobby\r\nCons:\r\nNo free wireless internet\r\nThe noise, even at the 25th floor. But hey, it\'s NYC!'
5,'Didn\'t encounter the problems others had','I\'ll be the first to admit we redeemed points for our room and were placed on the 42 level in an executive suite. The room was quite large, with an amazing bed, large panoramic windows, and a wet bar. We were traveling home from Africa, and this was just the respite we needed. The hotel is wonderfully located, and you can quickly leave and eat bagels, pizza, and see the sights. With check out at noon, we woke up, left the room to walk around Central Park, and returned around 11:55 to grab our bags and leave. We took the subway from JFK to the hotel and it was relatively easy (just one transfer). Being so high in the hotel, we heard no outside traffic. We did not use and of the hotel restaurants or facilities.'
4,'Good but crowded.','My friends and I stayed at a Deluxe room, and I was hoping it was a big room. Anyway our stay was great, and it is walking distance for many places. There are always a loooooot of people in this hotel, but rooms are quiet.'
4,'Great Location','Just got back from a 4 night stay in New York. We chose the Hyatt Grand because of its central location which really paid off for us. Grand Central Station is underneath the hotel and it is easy to go uptown to Central Park from here and down to Soho, Greenwich Village and the seaport area. If you are nervous about using the trains, then this is the best place to get advice about the routes and help with buying tickets. Hotel is big, but the rooms are absolutely fine and we found the staff very helpful. We looked out onto the Chrysler Building. We didn\'t have any tea or coffee making facilities in our room so we asked at the front desk and found a hotwater machine, tea and coffee waiting for us outside our room when we returned. Paper cups were provided. We asked at the restaurant if we could take china mugs back up to the room with us and they didn\'t have a problem with that. The cafe/diner opposite (red front), directly under the bridge, sorry can\'t remember the name, is great for light meals and breakfast. Its about a 10 minute walk to Times Square from the hotel. Skip Fifth Avenue, it is crowded, overpriced and with no atmosphere. I\'d recommend that you spend a lot of time in Soho and Greenwich Village. The shops are better and there is a great choice of restaurants and bars. It\'s a relaxing and charming area.'
4,'Huge and busy, but the staff delivered','I have stayed at the 6th Ave Hilton many times since 1980 and have a love/hate relationship with the hotel. It is large (1500 rooms - I think) and always busy. The main lobby is busier than Grand Central Station and rivals 5th Avenue during the Holidays. The elevators do their best to keep up but there is a wait sometimes at crunch periods (avoid 8:30 to 9am if at all possible). The Executive Lounge is packed at breakfast and there is always a wait for a table. Some rooms have been refurbished to the more modern Hilton style but a good many floors need work. My major pet peeve is the bathrooms. There is NO ROOM for one\'s stuff. And Heaven help you if you are traveling with a spouse! I have resorted to a hanging shaving kit as counter space is almost non-existent. \r\nOn this visit, the first room I was given was quite small even though I had taken some pains to make sure that there were two us initially and then our daughter was joining us for a few days - escaping her college for the weekend. We changed rooms into one that was bigger but learned something - this property does not have rooms with two queens - doubles are the biggest they have. This amazed me as even the lower class hotels have larger beds in twin bedded rooms. Unfortunately I left some articles in the original room - forgotten in the move. Expecting the worst, I contacted security, who found and returned the items in less than an hour. I was quite impressed with this efficiency and generally found all the staff friendly and helpful. This has not always been the case.....\r\nOverall, I was pleased with the stay and the location could not be better for my purposes.'
4,'good location , decent value','stayed here for 3 nights at New Year from December 31st to January 3rd . Purpose of trip mainly to get engaged / buy an engagement ring in new york. because of time of year and my late booking of trip hotels were very expensive and few and far between. originally booked something else with the idea of checking hotwire and priceline just before leaving. this showed up for £400 for 3 nights so i took it .\r\nhotel was good, nice downstairs , free wifi as well in rooms.\r\nprobably got a room at back because i was hotwire booking , definately try and get a room looking onto empire state building.'
4,'Great Stuff','Our first experience of New York (and the New Yorker) we took advice from previous reviews, yes we found the rooms smaller than what we were used to but the convenience of the hotel was spot on. The staff were excellent and the Tick Tock Diner was our favourite, even when we moved hotels we came back for a promised great meal from great staff. Coopers tavern also a highlight.'
3,'Get the right floor and get a good room','Myself and a colleague were in Chicago for business. We checked in early evening and there was no que. We had got a great rate through priceline.com for this hotel $70 a night, \r\nMy room was on the 19th floor. The lifts were a bit of a faf, lots of people getting in the wrong lifts for the wrong floors. My room was pretty big and a corner room so i had good views. It was very dated and had I paid anymore I would not have been too pleased.\r\nMy colleague had a room on the 15th floor. Wow his was so nice, very recently revamped I would say and the bathroom was 100 times nicer than mine. The room was very masculine, and looked like the one in the hotels own photo\'s, it was much smaller though and no view.\r\nLocation was superb, We only had the following morning to do some shopping before we flew back home. Easy walking distance from everywhere and the hotel are happy to hold bags for free for you after you have checked out.'
5,'The Palmer House rocks!','We stayed on a Honors award on 11/4 and got a wonderful junior suite on the 23rd floor with lounge access, free pop, cookies and excellent service. After reading some of these reviews I was leary but call in advance and ask nicely for an upgrade, particularly if you are an HHonors member'
4,'Great place but they have to fix the elevators','If you can get a decent rate this is a great choice in Chicago. Great location within walking distance of everything and a lively bar scene. I was here during Lolapalooza so it was a bit nutty but I would definetly stay here again. Except for one thing. I stayed on the 18th flor and only 2 elevators were working. At peak times the ware could be as much as 30 minutes. I gave up and walked down 18 floors several times. Only complaint but a big one'
3,'Good location, acceptable but could be better','Great location, just south of Central Park and close to subway station. The room is good size for NY city. The room is showing its age and housekeeping can do a better job, but all in all not too bad. The bed is too soft for my liking. The heater didn\'t work so it\'s a good thing it wasn\'t too cold when my husband and I stayed. If you can afford a more expensive hotel, you should. Otherwise this is not a bad place to stay if you\'re not too picky.'
5,'Treated as a special guest','The front desk staff was always extremely helpful and accommodating. I had three rooms for six people and desired to have two of the rooms next door to each other as we had young women in our group. The staff went above and beyond making sure that happened for us. All in all, every time I had a request I was treated as a special guest.'
4,'Great Location!','A group of 5 of us stayed at the Edison in February 2004 for my friends 30th Birthday, the hotel is in a very good location, it\'s about a minutes walk away from Times Square (which can get very very busy at times!) and good access to other places too!\r\nThe cafe down stairs is very good, they do a great breakfast. There\'s also a Deli next door which is great as it always seems to be open, so when the jet lag kicks in and you need a coffee at a silly time in the morning it\'s perfect!\r\nThe rooms were a good size and clean. They have safety deposit boxes in reception too which are very handy. \r\nI can also recommend a helicopter trip up and down the hudson river! It was well worth it! Wow!\r\nThis is a great central location to visit the Big Apple!'
4,'Great location','I stayed at the New yorker with my mum. The hotel rooms were small but very nicely decorated and an ok size bathroom with bath and shower. There is a 24 hour diner in the hotel which we went to each morning. \r\nThe hotel is in a fantastic locaion, we could see the empire state building from our room, maddison square gardens and macys was minutes away.\r\nThe only downer we had was that we didnt sleep too well due to the room opposite sitting ouitside their room and slamming the door in early hours, but on the third night we heard a security guard tell them to keep quiet and heard nothing since!\r\nWould go back!'
2,'Web site pictures are completely misleading','The room looms nothing like the pics on the web. They are very poorly maintained and smell like mold. There also isnt even any bath soap provided. I was completely grossed out and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.'
5,'Very comfortable and convenient to travel from.','We booked for 7 nights at Grand Hyatt, New York City, this hotel was a joy to stay in, so central for us, a couple of pensioners on holiday from United Kingdom. We would like to return and finish off our sight seeing.'
3,'Old 3 Star hotel with 5 star service','The New Yorker is a famous landmark classic art deco hotel built in 1930, \r\nsomewhat renovated in the 90\'s after is was bought by the unification church ( a religious cult). \r\nPros: Great ocation at 34/8 right next to Penn Station. The rooms are clean although on the small side, free wireless internet, a nicely equiped gym and a 24 hr diinner attached to lobby. The servie and security are top notch, as good as most 5 star hotels.\r\nCons: (and the list is long) the rooms can get quite cold in the winter (ours was cold even wt the thermostat on highest seting. No safe, no bar/fridge, no coffee makers, outdated bathroms, very low pressure in shower and lukewarm water only at times. Gym had only machines ( nice new Precor brand) but no free weights.\r\nNOT worthy of a 4 star hotel and I would not go back unless i had no better option.'
2,'Avoid disappointment,STAY AWAY','This hotel offered an impersonal reception at check in.The room allocated to us initially did not match the description of the room booked on their website.Very Basic.Returned to reception and were allocated another similar room 2 floors up.Main difference reading lamps on both sides of room instead of one. Bathroom stainless steel institution type functional.Cleanliness not exceptional. Shower caps only available on request according to clerk on check out desk. We stayed in 3 Times Square hotels over a fortnight. This is a 2 star establishment in comparison with the others in terms of hospitality and decor'
4,'Very good hotel for business.','I traveled to New York for business, and its hard to beat the convenience of this midtown location. The hotel was within walking distance of many of our meetings, it\'s close to the park, and very good subway access (most lines). Aside from location, the rooms and lobby are very nice, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and all of the amenities seem like you\'d expect from a hotel of this caliber. That said, this is a very large hotel, and very busy. You definitely do not get the boutique feel (not that I expected to). And it seems to be a very popular hotel for tourists. So it can feel kind of crowded. All in all, this is a great hotel for the business traveler.'
4,'Fun place, but don\'t pay full price!','I really like The Hudson, but I don\'t think I\'d pay the full price of $400 or so a night. Lobby very cool, I found the staff (esp concierge) to be very helpful. The room was pretty small but meticulously clean, and I love the high thread count sheets and designer toiletries! I was on the 11th floor so no noise complaints.\r\nOnly complaints: the air conditioning appeared to have three settings: cold, hot and off. The room did not have a safe and while front desk assured me one would be sent up, I was connected to security who apparently did not have any spare, which was a touch annoying. There was also a glass wall between the shower and the bed, so might be a little weird if you were travelling with a friend rather than a lover!\r\nOverall, a good stay, especially if you can get a heavily discounted room.'
4,'A perfect NYC location','I recently stayed at the Hilton New York while attending a conference. I have stayed at this hotel in the past, and this hotel certainly lives up to the Hilton brand. What is superior about this Hotel is the location -- close to the theater, restaurants, and shopping -- but somehow it\'s a bit insulated from much of the noise of the city. The Hilton New York offers rooms much larger than most hotels in Manhatten, and they are very clean and modern. It\'s a very comfortable feel for business or pleasure. This is a great place to bring your family, as the rooms are large enough that you could easily fit four people if you had too. And amazingly the Hilton New York is also pet friendly. I had a few instances where I engaged the staff and found them very helpful and friendly. One of the issues that I raised was that there was no coffee machine in my room. I was disappointed when the staff told me that Hilton had made the decision to remove them from the rooms, but the kind staff offered to deliver coffee to my room each day for no charge. I told them I thought that was kind of silly but I did accept thier Vouchers for free coffee at the hotel\'s Starbucks.'
1,'I have been wanting to do this for a long time....','....this hotel is the singularly most disgusting place I have stayed in. I have only lived in stayed in one place worse and that was a bad hostel. My friend warned me that someone private messaged her to say we shouldn\'t stay at this hotel, we had fallen for the hotel\'s bright and shiny website and the fact, they claimed, they had renovated rooms. A lot of the pictures show on this website depict the experience. but what they don\'t show is the stench. \r\nWhen we arrived we were given a room that had blood and hair in one bed (I kid you not). There was thick dust everywhere (everything was gray because of it) We were shattered but we were forced to go down to reception. \r\nWe were then given another room, this room was better but had not been cleaned. I thought they had given us someone else\'s room by mistake. because there was rubbish everywhere, beds looked like they had just been slept in. \r\nSo back down we went. Finally they gave us a room which was better, but still has my room crawling. I remember the stench and the terrible\r\nold, bathroom. \r\nOn my last day there I met a guy from another state who recounted almost exactly the same story to us, but he was smarter and had demanded his money back for the bad service. I would not recommend this place to anyone...I have stayed in hostels and hotels alike of varying levels and this is truly awful.'
4,'steve C and Claire F in new york','We have stayed at this hotel before and loved it,yes the rooms are a little bit small but who wants to stay in their room all the time.We came to see New York and the location of this hotel helped that in every way. The concierge booked us amazing tickets for a Rangers game the deli next door was great. All in all we loved it so much we are coming back on feb 25 2012 , I love this hotel and cannot wait to go back, see you soon Edison!!!'
2,'Great location.','We were looking for a affordable hotel near Times Square and found the Edison Hotel. We are use to large hotel rooms and found quite the opposite. The bathroom was so small the toilet seat would not go down because it would get caught on the toilet tissue dispenser. Everytime you wanted to raise or lower the seat you would need to move the paper roll. The bathroom water pipe to the toilet was painted silver and the paint was peeling badly. The shower was very nice and had plenty of water pressure. The closet was big enough but probably had 10-20 coats of paint on the coat hooks. All in all, the hotel had a very good location(1/2 block off Times Square) and clean but small rooms that are not well decorated. Also, there is no view.'
3,'Decevant pour son nom','En entendant le nom Crowne Plaza, je m\'attendais à un certain luxe, un certain espace dans les chambres. Et non. Certes, le lobby est d\'apparence luxueuse. Mais le petit déjeuner est hors de prix (27$ uniquement pour le dejeuner FROID). L\'air conditionné est utilisé à outrance, il fait froid dans les couloirs et dans la salle de restaurant. Nous avions demander deux lits king size, nous ne les avons pas eu. 1m20 pour deux... Les espaces entre les meubles etaient assez petits, difficile donc de passer quand on est trois dans la chambre! La salle de bain etait convenable sauf que la barre pour serviettes était cassée et le trou de la douche était plein de calcaire... Pour un Crowne Plaza, j\'ai été assez déçue. Internet hors de prix, chambre non nettoyée juste les draps remis en place et les serviettes remplacées à notre demande. Vue correcte, ménage ok sauf qu\'on nous a fait attendre 2h avant d\'avoir la chambre et nous avons du attendre 20min dans le couloir pour que la femme de chambre finisse son travail.. Mis à part cela, séjour convenable et consigne à bagages gratuite. Piscine au 15e étage mais 10$ même si nous logeons dans l\'hotel..'
5,'Super Hôtel','Nous sommes restés 10 jours avec ma fille en décembre 2011 et rien à redire sur notre séjour.\r\nChambre propre, calme (évidement du bruit à l\'extérieur mais on est à New York et c\'est largement supportable) Nous étions au 19ème étage.\r\nPersonnellement j\'ai beaucoup aprécié la décoration, très originale, mais je conçois que tout le monde ne soit pas fan.\r\nLa chambre pas très grande mais on était pas là pour y rester et surtout on avait largement assez d\'espace pour ranger nos affaires (4 valises quand mm), ils nous ont apporté des cintres supplémentaires sans souci.\r\nLe métro est au bout de la rue, Central Park aussi.\r\nIl y a autour de l\'hotel 2 restaurants, un drugstore et une superette ouverts 24h/24, donc même quand vous arrivez en plein décalage horaire vous avez de quoi vous occuper.\r\nLe personnel est à l\'écoute, serviable, ils ont répondu à toutes nos demandes.\r\nPour moi le seul point négatif est le prix du restaurant de l\'hotel, le 1er matin le petit déjeuner a coûté 75$ pour deux ! après nous l\'avons pris directement dans les cafés des alentours.\r\nPour ceux qui veulent dîner sur place après une longue journée de marche comme c\'était notre cas, nous achetions des plats à emporter au sous sol du mall de colombus circle (150m de l\'hôtel) il y a un énorme choix et tout est délicieux et nous les rapportions à l\'hotel.\r\nJe le recommanderai sans souci.'
1,'Old, smelly, run down. Nothing good to say about this hotel other than its location','Me and my wife had to relocate hotel as the one we originally booked was shut down due to power outage caused by Hurricane Sandy. Penn Hotel is expensive, old, smelly and eery - basically everything you don\'t need on a holiday. The only plus point is location which is just opposite Madison Square Garden where I had tickets for a Knicks game. Avoid this hotel at all costs. Trust me!'
4,'Hotel review','Overpriced. Room was Ok, location was GREAT. Unfortunately my stay was when Sandy disaster was in NY, but this was no fault of the Hotel. Most eatery was nearby and in walking distance. Just stand by the front entrance of 42nd street and people watch and you\'ll be amazed with all characters good and bad.'
4,'Very Good Deal for Family Trip','My wife booked the room and I was a bit nervous because of some mixed reviews I saw. We got 2 dbl beds for two nights and breakfast for 4, free parking for $420 plus tax. An excellent deal.\r\nThe free breakfast was actually very good. Large selection in the buffet and polite staff. The rooms were average, not at all fancy and the beds a bit small but we were there to enjoy NYC and not to stay in the room.\r\nGreat location and a short stroll to Times Square.'
3,'Be wary of price games','Great location, and worthy of a stay based on the history of the hotel alone. But whatever you pay, add about 3/4 of the price to your expected daily bill. \r\nParking (self, not valet) is half the price. Internet is another daily fee. I needed to use the business center, and was nailed for another $5 to figure out their internet wasn\'t working. No service for that and the front desk was too busy. Maybe good thing -- if I could have accessed my document and printed it the charge would have been over $20. So, not saying these charges only occur at the Palmer House, just that you need to be fully informed and expect nothing but a nice room, great location and historic ambiance. You will be bled dry for everything else. This is important to know because the hotel is a frequent Priceline and Hotwire seller, and if you go that route, the price you pay isn\'t nearly as attractive as many other comparable area hotels when you get to an apples to apples comparison. \r\nOther issues: Front desk staff less than helpful. Hot tub not working. No Queen beds, when you get two beds you get doubles.\r\nAll in all, though, the inherent positives of the property itself make the visit average, if much more pricey than it would appear at face value.'
5,'Excellent place to stay. Good location and great rooms','Enjoyed our stay. Concierge was very helpful and had a great trip to New York. Location was wonderful and the experience was all positive.'
3,'Not as bad as its cracked up.','Having read the slanderous reviews scattered throughout this page about the historical Pennsylvania Hotel, I was dubious about my visit in late January of 2008. Travelling with a large group with my 6th Form for a Philosophy Conference in the city on one of the days, made me even more worries. Mass groups almost always get the most torrid and unkempt rooms possible.\r\nAs everyone else has said, the location is nothing short of spectacular, the view from the 18th floor is something to behold. And being central on 7th, opposite madison square,penn station and a very large borders and with Macys a 5 minute walk down the road.It couldnt be better possitioned. Since I came with no high expectations, the room came to know suprise to me, if youre from the UK, its not unlike travel lodges or equally 3 star motels that litter the US. They are comfortable. A safe base. Somewhere to rest and wash. While the bathroom was slightly small for 4 people, the room we had was huge and with a nice view. Simply put, if It wasnt being knocked down in the next year, I would definitely stay again, especially for the value for money you get. But it IS, and i cant stress this enough, value. Dont come to the Penn expecting the Ritz or the Hilton, if you want them, you better crack open that wallet. \r\nI hope this review helps, for anyone on a budget and not with stupidly high standards, shoot for this hotel. Come with low expectations and Im sure it will charm you.'
4,'Just what I needed','I stayed at the hudson for 5 days at the beginning of December. I was slightly concerned with mixed views I had read on here. All I can say is it was just what I needed I was on my own and wanted somewhere in a perfect location close to all the things New York has to offer so location is excellent. I also though the staff were great when I checked in they noticed I was taller than average 6 ft 8. So they upgraded me to a slightly larger room. I\'m not sure what room it was but being on my own it was perfect. Plenty of space and a lovely comfy bed. I really don\'t know what the fuss is about the rooms being small it is NYC. Only disappointment was some of the hotel was being renovated. But overall a great funky hotel. In a great location and if I visit again I will certainly stay at the hudson. I also thought it was easy to sleep and I was on the 5th floor and heard no traffic noise maybe the alcohol made me sleep easier lol.'
3,'Average hotel in a good location','If you are a traveler who does not plan on spending much time in the room this hotel will be fine for you; however, if you are planning on spending time in your room or if you need additional space in your room this is not the hotel for you. Rooms outside of the king sized rooms or executive level rooms are small. Bathrooms are incredibly dated and basic. We found rooms to be clean overall and had everything we needed but were not luxurious at all. Staff was very nice and helpful and went out of their way anytime they could.'
4,'A great hotel but for a couple of indiscretions.','Everything about the place is lovely...however our only real grievances are related to two incidents. Firstly it was my girlfriend\'s 30th so I arranged for flowers to be delivered to the room, (even emailing weeks in advance, no reply) a fairly easy task, not so I had to go to reception and ask for their whereabouts so the surprise was then spoilt, and I was made to be grateful that they\'d arrived at all!\r\nSecondly on check out we were presented with bar bill receipts that were clearly not correct, this was disputed and and after promises of correct payment put back on the credit card we were made to chase for the money two months later.'
4,'Great central location quality hotel','Very professional service and check in procedure. Friendly staff helpful concierge with maps and directions. Very helpful bellboys and driveway attendants for hailing us cabs. Poor Internet connection $US 15 for 24 hours. Kept closing out. Go to McDonalds!!!! free. Four female friends shared a large double double room on 38th floor. Floors above 15 are more expensive but I believe better updated and appointed . Great corner room. Two large double beds and large bathroom. Toilet flooded once but staff attended promptly and all sorted and floors mopped and towels and shower curtain changed. \r\nTook bathers for a swim in the pool but found a charge of $US for each use which was a pity as we were looking forward to a nice swim after a day pounding the footpaths and shops. Would be nice to have pool free use for guests. \r\nA mention for Housemaid services lady Samia who attended our room to clean after a mix up with the notice we left on our door. The blank side does not mean clean the room please so they left it unmade, it apparently still means the same as the side that said Do not disturb. Samia came up in the evening when we arrived back and quickly and professionally did all our beds and bathroom. Left us plenty of extra towels and bottles of water to compensate. A nice lady. All in all a great location, right out the door and into the action, close walking distance to so much and cabs easy to get to other places.'

5,'Favorite place to stay in Manhattan','My husband and I love to stay at the Affinia Manhattan, the staff is excellent and we are always very pleased with our experience there. The bar and dining facilities are good and the hotel is convenient to many things.'
4,'Lucked out!','I recently had my first experience with Hilton Vacation Club - yes, I took \'that call\' and was offered 2 nights at the Hilton New York for $299 IF I sat through a 90 min presentation on their new property. While I was apprehensive about the sales pitch I did figure they are basically paying me to be there - the posted rate for the room that weekend was $450 per night (vs $150/night).\r\nThe sales pitch wasn\'t that bad and they took \'no thank you\' well. After you participate in the pitch they give you a $100 certificate to be used (that weekend) on the property - my friend and I used it up at the restaurants/bar. Additionally I asked for extra blankets and they never brought them - the next day I received an apologetic call from the Manager and 4 coupons for free breakfast at the hotel. Nice! The hotel itself does have large rooms by NYC standards - I laugh when people post that the rooms were small - try staying at the Hudson Hotel! That hotel will show you what small really is. The gym here is fantastic - new, large layout and great locker rooms. Of course you have central park a few blocks away which is a great place to run. I realize I had quite the deal this weekend with the Hilton New York - were I not enticed by the $299/2nights rate would I be so entranced? Maybe not. I\'d likely scour around for a better rate. Also one tip on the taxi queue - it can be quite long - just walk left out of the hotel and left onto 55th St and catch a cab there - skirt the line!'

1,'Just Gross','To be honest it felt more like Hotel TRANsylvania. What creeps! The line for check-in was an Ellis Island tribute. The bell hop was something out of a police line-up. The luggage room attendant (read thug) temporarily held your bags whilst collecting tips in a margarine container. Later that evening I was to enjoy a performance of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. The staff of Hotel Pennsylvania could be the cast. \r\nUpon entering the room, more trouble. We had neglected to call ahead and request light bulbs be placed in each of the lamps. The room was dark. I pulled back the drapes and found the window open, no screen. Could the last guest have jumped? This room would give him good reason. Plaster in the corners of the room bespoke falling ceilings and lazy housekeepers. Specks of black along the ceiling provided a mold faux finish. One each wall, faded wallpaper with rectangles of less-faded wallpaper and empty nails that cried out something once hung here! I had neither the courage nor the inclination to pull back the comforter and check out the bed. But the chair? The STAINS had stains. The phone? Not with rubber goves, baby. I used my cell phone to call and complain and STILL felt like I needed to bathe in a gallon of Purell. In a word, foul. Now, I am aware that hotels in NYC are pricey and please understand - I was not expecting the Ritz. But for $320/night I could just as well buy a new TV and watch a horror film, I don’t need to live one. They say that hotels often tell a story. This one seemd to be telling me to leave, and just as fast as I could. A quick call to hotels.com. I informed the friendly person who answered that I was not interested in staying at a crime scene-themed hotel and needed to make other arrangements. Shortly I was booked at the New York Helmsley and headed on my way. In all, my stay at Hotel Pennsylvania lasted 63 minutes. Too long.'
4,'Favorable experience @ Affinia','We arrived around 11 am on a Thursday for a 3 night stay and they let us check in immediately. Thought we\'d have to wait until 4 or so. Staff was courteous. Room was on 16th floor and had a fridge and microwave. Bed was comfortable and I didn\'t see any dirt. You may hear a fire truck or two or a cab honking in the night. If you\'re sensitive, bring some earplugs. I doubt if any other place in Manhattan is going to be much quieter.'
1,'Don\'t Book It!','The exterior of the hotel and lobby look beautiful but the rooms have old beat up mattresses and bedding. The walls are cracked with peeling paint and the bathroom is very outdated. Only one bath towel suppliel for a family of three, two hand towels and a wash cloth. We were afraid to get into the beds and slept ontop with our jackets and hoods on so we didn\'t have to touch anything. We were even afraid to take our shoes off!!!'
5,'Chic, descolado e localização perfeita!','Hotel ideal para jovens sofisticados, ambiente aconchegante, decoração impecável de phillip starck, gente bonita e baladas, além da localização perfeita!'
3,'A hip hotel but felt like a cheap motel.','The Hudson New York is only worth for it\'s location and bar. The rooms are a shame for an upscale hotel. There are so tiny that the door almost can not be open completely, the beds are uncomfortable and the lack of room make you feel like a hospital room. Also we found it very unclean (see pictures).\r\nPros:\r\nGreat location\r\nPublic areas (bar, lounge, terrace, restaurant)\r\nCourteous and helpful staff.\r\nCons:\r\npoor quality rooms\r\nhorrible alleys (dark and smelly)\r\nvery crowded public areas, the bar on the weekends is crazy,\r\nlack of room amenities like minibar, tiny desk, no luggage storage, awful bath room.\r\nThe AC is located just behind the headboard so be prepared to be cold all night and bring earplugs for the noise.\r\nvery very unclean and poorly maintained.\r\nI only would recommend it if you goal is to party and experience the new york socialite, so is a better idea to stay somewhere else and go to the Hudson bar for drinks.'
4,'Good value for money','Really clean and tidy. Nothing amazing but perfectly nice and good locationn'
2,'Nuenca dormi en una habitación tan pequeña','Las habitaciones son enanas, no tiene armario, solo un espacio en la pared sin puerta ni nada donde dejas la maleta y puedes colgar algo de ropa.\r\nEl cuarto de baño es ridiculo.\r\nEl lobby del hotel es impresionante.\r\nLa terraza es fantástica para tomar alguna copilla con amigos.'
4,'Great Location','We only had a few days to enjoy NYC and the location of the Park Central Hotel was perfect for what we wanted to do. It was close to Times Square and Central Park and there was subway access on the corner! The hotel was very nice, the room was bigger than I expected, the service was good, and price was competitive. I would definitely stay there again!'
4,'torneremo qui!','posizione eccellente (a due passi da time square e dall\'empire), cordialità e disponibilità del personale, pulizia della camera. se siete fortunati e come noi soggiornerete ai piani alti (noi eravamo al 31° piano) potrete godere di un\'ottima vista sulla città...quando torneremo a new york torneremo sicuramente in questo albergo! da provare anche l\'adiacente tic toc...ottima colazione in vero stile americano!'
5,'Perfect view of Times Square','Huge room with direct view of the Waterford Crystal 2012 New Year\'s Eve Ball. Can\'t imagine what this room goes for on New Year\'s Eve!! Love the location. Tony at the concierge desk actually got us last minute reservations for Le Bernardin that normally take a month to get!! This is our second stay and will stay again.'
5,'Excellent Staff and Service','We recently spent a week at the Affinia for my wife\'s birthday and as most holidays go, a few things went wrong. I found the Affinia staff extremely helpful and not only solved our concerns immediately but went out of their way on many occasions. I would highly recommend the Affinia and would definitely stay again when I am in New York.'
4,'Fantastic service!','Hilton NYC is a wonderful hotel where I stay weekly, so I\'ve gotten to know it well. The front desk staff, in particular Anika Makoonsingh are top notch and ensure a positive reception and service at all times. If you are in NYC, this is absolutely the place to stay, as the rooms, restaurants and exec lounge are top notch.\r\nAlso, don\'t miss the fitness center, one of the best you will find in a hotel.'
2,'hot, hot, hot','My husband, our 2 young kids and I stayed here Sunday 11/25 - Monday 11/26. My husband is a priority club member and used his accumulation of points to redeem for a reward night. The hotel is in a great location and check in went smoothly. We were able to check in early, which was great for us. Our room was clean and everything in order. When we first went to our room, it felt very warm in our room. My husband lowered the temperature on the thermostat and we left figuring the room would cool down while we were gone. We returned about 4-5 hours later and the room was even warmer (74 degrees). We opened the window, hoping that would help to cool things down, but it did not. We were getting ready to go out so my husband called the front desk to inform them we could not cool down the room. They said they would send someone up. We were told we didn\'t need to be there so we went out for the night. We returned about 4 hours later and our room was still registering 74 degrees. The panel to the heating, air conditioning system was left open and it appeared that the heat had been shut off and the fan left running. Even though the window was open, the room would still not cool down. My husband called the desk again to find out the outcome or if someone would be back to work on our system (even though it was 10:30 at night). He was informed by the front desk that the hotel is always very warm in the winter months as they usually only have the heat on and for some reason our thermostat wasn\'t working, but there was nothing they could do. They offered to bring up a fan for us, which they did. So, despite having a fan and window open, we spent an uncomfortable, sleepless night at 75 degrees in our hotel room. Needless to say, the next day was difficult as no one had slept! Fortunately this was our only concern, but unfortunately it was a big one. We were in NYC the same time last year and stayed at a hotel one block away and did not have this issue Not sure we will return to the Crowne Plaza.'
3,'Emplacement idéal pour ceux qui veulent sentir vibrer Manhattan mais peut mieux faire pour ses 4 étoiles','Incontestablement listé dans les hôtels les mieux placés de Manhattan pour ceux qui aiment les lumières et l animation de Times square \r\nC était notre deuxième séjour au crowne et cette fois ci nous sommes repartis moins emballés. Certes le rapport qualité prix n est pas mauvais sur le prix de la chambre mais ils ont encore qqs efforts sur la qualité des prestations. Notre chambre avait un coin de mur endommagé... Le prix des breakfast est exagérément cher ( 26 à 32 e !). \r\nLe hall a été intégralement refait dans un esprit de déco loundge plutôt réussi mais comme beaucoup d\' hôtels sur Times square le desk est au 1 er étage et l entrée sur Broadway en est rendue quelconque. \r\nL accès à la piscine du new york sports club est appréciable mais attention il faut y aller avec un mental de sportifs. La seule ligne d\' eau réservée pour l hôtel impose d\' enchainer des longueurs sous peine de se voir regarder de travers par le maître nageur. \r\nNous essaierons la prochaine fois de changer d\' hôtel si nous trouvons mieux. N oublions pas que l hôtellerie de manhattan est hors de prix.'
4,'LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION','Our family of 4 recently stayed here for seven nights. We arrived at 12:30 in the morning and had called ahead to inform of our late arrival. Check in was fast. We were put in a room with two double beds on the 21st floor. The view was great, but you could hear the hum of traffic.\r\nI was disappointed right away because the bathtub was not very clean. There was wear around the drain, but the biggest problem was the soap scum on the faucet and the hair in the tub. GROSS! I called down to be moved immediately. We were moved to another room that was satisfactory on the 20th floor. The rest of our stay was great. We were close to subways, broadway shows, restaurants, shopping, and tickets booth. Check out Amy\'s bread for breakfast on 9th betw 47th and 46th. I fell in love with the cafe au lait and the cherry cream scones with jam. As other reviwers have stated the elevators were quick, staff was pleasant, and room was tidied everyday. As a priority club member we received free internet and breakfast which was a bonus. Having to pay for internet is a big negative of this hotel.\r\nI would stay here again.'
4,'Excelente ubicacion','Muy buen hotel en el mejor lugar de NY (Time Square). La habitacion que nos toco, fue pedida al hacer la reserva por TE, fue excelente, piso 16 vista a TS, muy comoda y silenciosa (la 1611). Mucho cuidado con las habitaciones interiores que no tienen vista. El personal de habla hispana muy amable, no tanto los que hablaban ingles, no hacen el menor esfuerzo por complacer al cliente y algunos hasta se molestan cuando uno no habla ingles. En la parte del desayuno y restaurante, que es muy bueno, hay un encargado, Jorge, que es un fenomeno. De Guatemala, con una amabilidad y nivel de servicio excelente.\r\nCriticas: estuvimos varios dias sin calefaccion y no le dieron solucion, siempre excusas, algunos de recepcion son deliberadamente mentirosos. Hablando con un viejo empleado del hotel, nos comento que es una falencia del hotel, cuando hay un problema tardan mucho en resolverlo y que hay que quejarse. Yo discuti con un manager y nos devolvieron U$S 200 del total de la cuenta. No compensa el frio que pasamos por las noches, 4/5 º. Estuvimos 8 noches y la arreglaron para las ultimas 2 noches.\r\nTodos los problemas que pudieron haber pasan desapercibidos por la gran ubicacion del hotel, uno sale a la calle y enfrente esta la tienda de Mars, un espectaculo el cartel, y ya se encuentra en la zona de teatros, restaurantes, comercios, muchos carteles, etc. Muy bonito.'
3,'Great location!','I was quite pleased with hotel for the price. I was surprised to find a hotel in the $200 price range right in the heart of NYC and this was it. The location is fantastic! Although the room was small it had everything that was needed to enjoy the city. The room was clean and comfortable. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York.'
5,'Happy to recommend','My daughter and I have just returned home after a wonderful stay. Booked a 2 bed room and were allocated a recently refurnished room on the 22nd floor, overlooking 7th Avenue and with a view of Madison Square Garden. Room was a good size, well decorated and very clean. Bathroom was small but perfectly adequate with towels changed every day. Wonderfully comfortable beds with choice of pillows (which we didn\'t need, as the ones provided were perfect!) meant that we could sleep very well after our very tiring days of sightseeing. Although I was worried by previous reviews, we had no problems with the street noise.Perhaps being so high up helped, but I expected some noise from the traffic (surely part of the New York experience) and it did not disturb us. \r\nThe location of the hotel is great - we could easily walk to the Empire State Building, Macy\'s, 5th Ave, Times Square and the theatre district and always felt safe even when walking back to the hotel at night. The subway at Penn station opposite the hotel was very handy for trips further afield, and again we felt very safe using it. We booked a shared shuttle to get us from the airport to the hotel, but next time I would take the train as the station is just across the street.\r\nThe staff at the hotel were all very friendly, polite and helpful without exception, although I am unable to comment on their handling of complaints as we had absolutely nothing to be dissatisfied about!! They were happy to keep our bags secure for us after check out, so that we could enjoy our final hours in the city without hassle.\r\nIf I had to nit-pick I would say that there was a slight lack of clothes storage in the room and a hook behind the bathroom door would have been useful. Also I agree that free wi-fi would be great, but then perhaps the rooms would be less affordable?!\r\nAll in all a fantastic trip and an ideal place to stay.'
4,'very good','Wonderfull Location for this hotel. A bit old fashion but this is a really good value for Time Square and for the offer we got.\r\nBreakfast included, double bed, and not to expensive\r\nAcross the street Time Square, subway, tours, shops, restaurants... what else do you need ?\r\nThe staff was really nice and helpfull.\r\nWe really enjoy our stay there.'
4,'magnifico hotel','Siamo stati in questo albergo in maggio, la posizione è davvero magnifica, fai un isolato e sei sulla Broadway e la prima cosa che vedi è il teatro di Dave Letterman con attigua e non meno importante la pizzeria di Angelo\'s pizza(ottimo). Le camere sono confortevoli, è molto pulito, silenzioso, assolutamente uno dei migliori in cui sono stata, lo sto consigliando e sicuro riandrò.'
4,'What a great terrace!!','Just returned from 3 nights at \'The Hudson\'. Positives to begin with! \r\n Good location, near central park and a lovely mall which has some great bars, including a jazz lounge. Extemely clean and modern hotel. It dosen\'t really look like a hotel from outside as there isn\'t a grand lobby, just lifts up to reception. Once you go up the lifts it has the wow factor! Three great bars, two being on the first floor. One very modern with a glass floor and later on loud music and dancing which we felt was more for the teeny boppers and didn\'t go in. The other is very chilled and swish. It is outside,lovely furnishings, very sexy waitresses in chinese style robes with rather large splits up the sides!! (much to the fellows delight!) Our favourite was the roof top bar, great ambience and fab views at night. The room was very clean and modern.\r\nNegatives were the entrance as mentioned above. A few nice potted trees and you have said all. The hotel is very dark inside, the lobby, the hallways and the rooms. You may love this or hate it. I thought it gave a nice feel to the lobby but brighter hallways and a room would be good. The rooms are teeny tiny! We thought it was just ours and complained but was told 60\% are this size and we heard somebody else talking about it in the lift! My husband is six foot and found it difficult to sit on the loo as there isn\'t enough room for your legs! It is basically just a bed in a dark modern room. Bar and tv etc are built in the wall and they don\'t do drawers!! So our underwear etc stayed in the case! Rather odd. They have hanging space as you walk in and a shelf above it which is ok if you are tall for t-shirts etc.\r\nAll in all a nice hotel and I would go back.'
5,'Fabulous stay at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan','I booked a room at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan because I wanted both a hotel in the middle of Midtown/Broadway and I wanted to use my upgraded Priority Club privileges. I was very pleased with my stay.\r\nThe hotel\'s location is perfect -- right smack in the middle of everything you\'d want to see on Broadway. I walked to the theatre, to the souvenir shops, to Starbucks and to the Hershey\'s Candy store (a must for choco-holics!)\r\nThe service was excellent. I came in on a very early flight, so I arrived at the hotel hours before check-in. Although they didn\'t have a room available at that time, they said they\'d do everything they could to get me into one as soon as possible. They were true to their word -- I only waited a short time and they readied a room for my early check-in.\r\nMy evening schedule was very tight, so I had to order room service for several nights. The room service waiter was extremely pleasant (I had the same waiter each night) and the food was good.\r\nThe Concierges were pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable. They pointed me to some wonderful eateries.\r\nThe room itself was quite comfortable, and I truly enjoyed my stay there. I will be going back!'
2,'Bien situé, c\'est tout','Cet hôtel est parfaitement situé pour faire des visites,(métro à coté etc ...) mais ne vous attendez pas à autre chose. Le ménage n\'y est fait que partiellement... L\'attente à la réception est longue ... Et vu les tarifs affichés je m\'attendais à mieux ...'
5,'Excellent hotel, great location','Stayed at the Affinia Manhatten, An excellent friendly hotel in the perfect location to get to all the great sites. Directly opposite Madison Square Garden, one block away from Macy\'s and about 10 minutes walk from Times Square. I cannot wait to go back!'
3,'I should have planned ahead','Mediocre New York hotel. I\'m used to paying the usual exorbitant rate, but shame on me for not planning ahead. You can do way, way better with a boutique hotel over this one. Looks to be some refurbishment going on, so maybe it\'ll pick up afterwards.\r\nDecent location, near the park, but there\'s a number of options as close or closer and for the sake of a few blocks\' walk, you\'ll have plenty to choose from.\r\nTip... turn down the heating to kick out cool air the minute you get in the room. They have it set to \'sauna\' for some reason. \r\nNext time I\'ll plan ahead.'
5,'Perfection from check in to check out.','From the second the bellman opened the door I felt at ease. I was greeted by another member of the staff who was very attentive. He escorted us to the desk even though it was too early to check in he encouraged us to try. The girl at the desk allowed us to check in early and off to our room we went. Boy were we so surprised when we opened the door, We stood there in awe. The room was immaculate and the the lighting was perfect. Every single person who worked at this hotel was helpful and sincere. I cannot wait to stay here again and again. It couldn\'t get any better, oh wait, I almost forgot, the location is amazing!! Thanks to Jay at the front desk who allowed us a late check out. see you all soon,\r\nMaryLou'
3,'Really, not so bad!','After having read many of the reviews I was a little concerned about having friends make reservations for us at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The following is our experience:1 - Check in was slow - it took about a half hour, but they did have 5 people working at the front desk. 2 - Valet parking was quick and easy. 3 - Staff was friendly. This is a once upon a time grand hotel that is showing signs of wear, but our room was clean, the shower pressure was strong, the hotel was quiet. Most importantly, the price was good and the location was amazing. We walked up to Times Square and down to the Village very easily. The positives far outweigh any negaives when it comes to staqying at the Hotel Pennsylvania.'
5,'Excellent Stay and look forward to staying again.','I love the location. It is in the middle of everything. The customer service representatives were very professional, courteous and expeditious in getting their customers checked in and out.'
2,'Bruyant et cher...','J\'ai séjourné du 27 décembre 2008 au 1er janvier 2009 au Parc Central avec ma famille, nous étions 5 avec 3 chambres.\r\nL\'arrivée à l\'hotel vers 14h, le 27 nous a mis dans l\'ambiance: un portier a pris nos bagage pour faire 10 mètres jusqu\'au hall d\'accueil de l\'hotel et a insisté de manière agressive pour que je lui donne un pourboire, je n\'avais pas encore de monnaie...\r\nEnsuite, il nous afallu laisser nos bagages à la consigne ( 1,75 dollar par bagage) car les chambres n\'étaient disponibles qu\'à partir de 16 h ( pas de petits profits...), rebelote au départ, notre avion étant à 22h et les chambres devant être libérées à 12h... \r\nLes chambres pourtant jolies et assez spacieuses et équipées, n\'étaient pas insonorisées et l\'on pouvait entendre outre le bruit de la rue , des sirènes de police et d\'ambulance, fréquentes à NY, la climatisation de l\'hotel à l\'extérieur en bruit sourd et continu...\r\nA signaler un cafard dans l\'une dse chambres...\r\nCet hotel de 25 étages disposaient de 4 ascenseurs, pourtant à chaque fois l\'attente était interminable, pas rare de passer un quart d\'heure à attendre ...\r\nLe personnel (mis à part le portier!) était aimable sans plus, ne parlant pas le français ( pourtant grosse clientèle française dans cet hotel et à NY ).\r\nLe point positif de cet hotel est son emplacement , prés de Central Park , de Time Square, de la 5éme avenue...\r\nJe ne choisirai plus cet hotel lors d\'un éventuel prochain séjour à NY.'
5,'perfect hotel for mini break','stay here if you are coming to New York to shop and take in the sights\r\nIt is on the metro line from JFK right outside the 34th Street station so there is no wandering about with heavy luggage.\r\nIt is a five minute walk to times square, Macys is 2 minutes down the block and its right in the centre of town on a really handy subway line\r\nthe tick tock diner is below the hotel very handy for breakfast and lunches \r\nmy room was lovely comfortable and clean, we had a giant double bed, wide screen tv, safe, massive closet for all our shopping and an iron and a board. we got a great view of the city and I would stay here again very soon'
2,'si può trovare di meglio','abbiamo soggiornato 6 notti in occasione del nostro viaggio di nozze, prima tappa. Abbiamo raggiunto l\'hotel in taxi, la posizione è perfetta, più centrale di così non si poteva pretendere. Dalle recensioni trovate immaginavamo di non trovare un hotel di lusso ad attenderci. La hall è molto ed il bar sono molto caratteristici, le camere sono davvero piccole. Siamo stati fortunati perchè la nostra camera era pulita ed è stata pulita ogni giorno durante il nostro soggiorno, per cui non ci possiamo lamentare. I bagni richiederebbero una ristrutturazione, così come il mobilio, molto antiquato. Di nuovo avevamo solo la tv. La colazione non era inclusa, e neanche la wi-fi, abbiamo ovviato con lo strarbucks proprio di fronte l\'hotel. Diciamo che paragonato ad un 3 stelle italiano non c\'è paragone ma se siete pronti a non lamentarvi per ogni cosa fuori posto e volete essere a times square, potete scegliere questo hotel. l\'hotel è sicuro, controllano la card a chiunque si avvii verso le camere.'
5,'A very enjoyable break','This was our 2nd visit staying at the Edison and once again we had a great visit. Our room was on the 15th floor and was very pleasant with two very comfortable queen size beds. Very clean and fresh.. Bathroom was small but had everything we needed and the staff could not have been more helpful. From the doorman to Victor and Ronaldo on reception and also the housekeeping lady could not have done more to make our stay comfortable. We happened to mention in passing to the housekeeping lady that our room was very warm and she arranged for someone to sort out the air con for us straight away, so when we arrived back the room was cooler. Top class service. Considering what this city and it\'s people have been through in the last few weeks, with Sandy only 2 weeks before and winter storm Athena 1 day before we arrived, the New York people know how to just get the job done and get this wonderful, exciting city back to normal. A big thank you to all the staff at the Edison Hotel'
4,'worth it for the location','Yes the rooms are not that great, but then it\'s cheap and one of the best locations in town. If the hotel is the most important part of your stay then go elsewhere. If it\'s just a bed for the night then this hotel is superb. I\'d stay there again.'
5,'Best place to stay','Excelente experience, everyone very nice, very good location'
5,'Westin at Time Square - Pampering at its BEST','Visited New York for our daughters marathon, and stayed at The Westin. We could not have\r\npicked a better spot. Right in the middle of all activities and excitement from the minute you walk out the front door. Before you enter the hotel the pampering begins. You are greeted by doormen who ,with no questions, immediately take your bags, tag them and prepare to deliver them to your room. At the front desk you are greeted once again by extremely pleasant and friendly personnel, who just can\'t do enough for you. The rooms are very warm and inviting, room service, top notch and the onsite restaurant is fabulous. We have stayed here before and always feel like we are amongst family and friends. We look forward to coming back and at staying at other Westins as well. You just can\'t go wrong.'
4,'Great Place to stay on our First trip to NYC!','My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in April. I knew it would be a great stay when we had an excellent person checking us in. She apologized for the main entrance being closed for construction but it was not an issue with us. There is a side door which takes you just a few steps from 7th avenue.\r\nI was impressed with the size of our studio suite as I had been warned the NYC rooms are small. We had a large, extemely comfortable bed with a menu for pillows! There was a decent sized desk area, kitchen with micro, frig, stove, and sink. All utensils, plates, and towels were provided. The bathroom was small but functional- great water pressure. We also had a balcony, although it took us a minute to find it. Like the TV show Friends, you had to go through the window! It wasn\'t a balcony you would want to hang out on and it had no view, but it was there as promised!\r\nMy husband attended seminars all day down the block from the hotel so I just walked or took a cab to all the sights. I was never uncomfortable in this area, even at nigt. The doormen were very polite and were always able to get a cab right away. I didn\'t try the subways, but the hotel is across from Penn Station which would make train/subway use very convenient. Macys is really close and it isn\'t too far to Times Square. I found it quite easy to navigate around the city. The hotel has a concierge available but I had did not need to use their services. \r\nBeing from the midwest, the nightly rate seemed high, but in checking other rates and locations, this was a good deal for New York. We will definitely stay at the Southgate (soon to be Affinia) on our next trip.'
4,'Friendly although hotel needs improvements!','It was my first time to new york with my boyfriend, when we arrived we were impressed with the first impressions they helped us with our suitcases and the staff and other guests were very friendly! When checking in I had read some reviews on the hotel about the noise and its best to ask for a higher room, which i did, although we waited an hour for a room on a higher level came back to check in and it still wasn\'t ready and had to wait another 2hours if we wanted it. So we decided to go with a lower level. The views were amazing we faced times square and it was beautiful at night. \r\nThe rooms were small, the bed was comfy and the rooms were so clean! Although the windows it was drafty and the heating was so hot at night the radiators looked like they were going to fall off. \r\nThe bathroom was small we didnt have any cold water to brush our teeth with and the shower took 15minutes to warm up, there is no space to put toiletries. (and the wardrobes are very small).\r\nAlthough the rooms weren\'t up to my standard the staff were amazing and attentive made us feel at home. The cleaner came daily and the room was always tidy when we got back. \r\nAt reception they booked us the best basketball seats they could and thanks to them we could go and watch a basketball game. \r\nI\'ve read in other reviews that the noise was an issue and you can\'t sleep very well, after a long day of a lot of shopping and walking a few miles i thought it would be easy to sleep im a deep sleeper but the noise is very loud! Fire engines and taxi horns, I counted the space between cab horns and it was a space of 30seconds which was the longest i didnt hear a beep for! \r\n However the resturant was delicious too! I recommend to eat in there, we never had dinner there but on our first day we had lunch and i recommend the ceaser salad, and the buffet breakfast! Its good value! Hotel guests also get 10\% off dinner. \r\nOverall we had an amazing trip, and we couldnt fault the staff although rooms need to be looked into! \r\nIf your a deep sleeper and dont have much stuff with you you will enjoy this hotel!'
4,'Propre, confortable, très bien situé...','Cet hôtel est extrêmement bien situé (10 - 15 minutes à pied d\'une part de Time Square, et de l\'autre de Central Parc, métro Colombus Circle, 5th avenue, etc...)...Les chambres sont très propres, confortables, et contrairement à beaucoup d\'hôtels du coin, elles sont assez modernes. Le jour de votre départ l\'hôtel vous propose un forfait avantageux pour garder vos bagages en consigne toute la journée, puis le trajet en taxi, péage et tips compris. Hautement recommandable!'
1,DIRTY,'Don\'t be fooled by the lobby f this hotel. The rooms are DIRTY! I don\'t even want to sleep for fear of catching something. The chair in my room was visibly very dirty. There was exposed wiring, the floor outside in the hallway in front of my room was dirty. the walls are cracking and peeling. it is just old dirty and nasty here. if I was not here for a conference for my job I would be leaving. And the customer service of the bell captain was horrible as well. My company shipped boxes to us for the conference. We were told to set up for the conference at 7pm. When I asked the bell captain if he could show us to the package room to get our shipment he refused because he said he would have to get someone to cover the desk...well ok, then do so. But he kept refusing. He had to get the organizer of the conference to basically force them to let us have our packages. I have not been here four hours and I am ready to go. Unfortunately I am here for 2 more days.'
1,'Horrible rooms! Beware!','Beware of the cheaper rooms that you book online. We booked a single bed room for only ~120 a night, which we thought was great for that price in Manhattan. We weren\'t expecting anything fancy, just a normal room of the caliber you expect from a typical motel (Day\'s Inn, Motel 6, etc). The room was HORRIBLE. Non working blinds, dirty walls, mold in the bathroom walls, peeling paint, very weak water for the showers. I would compare it to low cost housing, maybe even worse. In hindsight, I would have to wonder if that room met building codes. Do not be fooled by the beautiful lobby, once you get up to your floor, the hallways are dark and the rooms horrible. Granted, I can only speak for room in that price range, it is possible if you pay for the higher priced rooms, it may be habitable.'
4,'Great Hotel, Great Stay, a solid 4 of 5, would stay again.','PCR Plat Member, redeemed points for 2 nights of a long 5 night trip over Thanksgiving. Hotel is in a great location on the North end of Times Square, this allows access to the sights, but also makes it easy to drive in a car and park. Just a few blocks south is much more chaotic. At check-in we were greeted promptly and friendly. We were given a high floor, king bed as requested. They couldn\'t accomodate further from the elevator as we had requested. Unfortunately we had a room, that had an adjoining door to the next room, even though it was closed and locked, we could still hear noise from the adjoining room until they checked out (day 1 fortunately). \r\nThe room itself was new, fresh, and clean. It had a comfortable bed, and clean linens. The bathroom was very nice and modern with a shower only, with nice towels. Some NY Hotel reviews mention that since it\'s NY you won\'t spend much time in the room, but it\'s so nice to come back to a nice clean quiet room after a long day of treking around the city. \r\nService- Internet was free b/c we of being a PCR Plat member. We also had access to the executive lounge area, but they only serve breakfast. It\'s adequate but nothing special. Coffee, Fruit, Juice, Bagels/Toast with a toaster, and Oatmeal are the only hot options. I know this was thanksgiving week, but there was very limited seating in the lounge, it should be much larger for such a large hotel. The executive lounge has no happy hour as in other CP\'s or even Staybridge Suites. All the staff, porters, bellman, frontdesk were very helpful, professional and courteous. \r\nMy only complaint was the A/C... it was unseasonably warm in NY while there, and the HVAC unit would not cool the room. We left the window open to help, but still too warm in the room (74-75 degrees). I called the front desk to send up a tech, but when we returned to the room it was still 74, and the window was open. \r\nEven with the AC trouble, we would gladly stay again. I liked the hotel and service overall far better than our experience later in the week at the Intercontinental Times Sq. That is another story all together. I would definately stay at the CP Times Sq again, and plan to in 2012.'
1,'What a terrible place','We checked in early and was told our two bedroom unit would be ready in a couple of hours. We went sight seeing and came back late in the evening and reception had problems finding a suitable room for us and then told us our one bedroom was ready. When I asked about the two bedroom we booked and were told we were getting, we were told the one bedroom really is a two bedroom because it has a sofa sleeper. The room is out dated and dirty. There were two window air condition that were blowing cold air into the rooms ( it\'s 20 degrees F outside) and little is being done, maybe cover the opening with paper.\r\nI would strongly suggest staying away from this hotel.'
3,'bon rapport:qualité prix','Hôtel très bien situé, propre et chambre avec belle vue sur la 7th avenue, m\'y suis rendue 2 fois cette année et la chambre était très correcte; Une personne dans la chambre a été rajoutée en dernière minute et aucun supplément ne m\'a été réclamé.Personnel a la réception très sympa.\r\nNombreux commerce dans les environs dont Macy\'s juste à côté et à 2 rues de l4empire State Building et face au Madison Square garden.\r\n.'
1,'Not worth the hassle','Old building with small rooms, now a tired old space with small rooms and uninterested unresponsive staff.'
5,'Excellent hotel - well located - new SPG floors','This is one of my favorite Starwood hotels. It is well located, SPG floor rooms are very spacious and the heavenly beds are very nice. It is close to the attaractions and businesses on Times Square but away from the noise of Time Square.'
3,'Bom, mas custo benefício médio.','Bom hotel, confortável, limpo, arrumado. Quarto pequeno, próximo a metrôs e grandes atrações (Empire State Building, Macy\'s). Mas o custo benefício na minha opinião não compensa, um pouco caro quando comparado a outras opções de mesmos benefícios.'
3,'Dingy rooms, but great location and lobby','This hotel is a Chicago landmark I guess. It has an amazing lobby, kind of reminds me of the Waldorf in New York, but smaller. The staff is friendly. I am here for business, and as the hotel is located right in the loop - it is really well located. I imagine that if you are here for tourism it\'s also well located because it is near Millenium Park and things.\r\nBut the rooms are old and strange. In the room I had, the TV was 5 meters away from the bed. There was a big empty space in the middle of the room. The bathroom was very cramped with no space to put my things. The furniture was worn.'
4,'central hotel at good value','Affinia in Manhattan is very confortable and central. Lobby people are very nice. We wre at 11° floor and there was sometimes a bit of noise from outside (cars). higher floors will have less noise.I\'ll come back here if I\'ll be in NY city again. Roberta'
3,'Perfectly Fine, Except For The Bedbugs','We stayed for 2 nights thanks to a priceline rate of $110/night.\r\nLocation is great, service was fine.\r\nRoom was small, but stylish and functional for the most part.\r\nI had 2 problems with this place. \r\n1-No ventilation in the room-kinda stuffy. Take a shower and the room stays humid for days.\r\n2-Bedbugs. \r\nFunny, I checked this site and one person complained about bedbugs but I thought it was just some disgruntled employee.\r\nI can confirm that this is not the case. \r\nI was bitten all over my lower legs, causing severe itching and tiny red bumps (and some bleeding) for a week after I left. \r\nI understand that New York has an infestation right now, so this problem is probably not limited to the Grand Hyatt.\r\nI would\'ve given this place 4 stars if it were\'nt for these issues.'
5,'Typical Four Star Hotel','This facility is a typical 4 star hotel. Everything is clean, well-organized and stylish. We stayed here via Priceline and were given a standard size hotel room which was perfect. Their location is not quite in the middle of Times Square, which if you ask us, is a good thing. The facility felt very secure; the hotel desk is on the second floor. The first floor entrance has a large vehicle/luggage drop off area and an interior security check and is well staffed. We would stay here again.'
3,average,'the solid thing about this hotel is the location.. steps from penn station/MSG .. the negatives were the pillows.. not very comfortable and no choice in selection.. we found strands of hair on the duvet.. that always grosses you out.. we found em only on the outside.. we were on the 26th floor yet had a view of a brick wall.. the price was reasonable as NY hotels can be really expensive.. overall it was ok.. but im not sure if i would stay here again..'
5,'location fantastic, friendly staff','great hotel in a fantastic location especially for first time visitors to NYC or anyone who wants to stay in midtown. great location near the park and columbus circle subway which gets you everywhere. staff really friendly and efficient. lobby is fab. bar is gorgeous if not a bit pricey! only downside is the rooms are quite small.'
1,'Terrible customer service...oh and they don\'t clean the rooms!','I\'ve just come back from New York where I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 6 nights. Between my mother, sister and myself we had two good sized rooms which each had two double beds. I was more than happy with the rooms although the bathrooms are incredibly small and the location is very central however the customer service I and the rest of my family received was awful! For two nights I was unable to get into one of my rooms as I was told the lock was broken, I kept being assured that this would be fixed asap however as I stated this did not happen for two days and each time I spoke to a member of staff about this they either had no idea about the problem or were just very unwilling to help. Also and very worrying neither of our rooms were cleaned properly the entire duration of our stay. I was told that housekeeping will not make the bed if any items are on it that includes nightwear...I have stayed in countless hotels and have never heard of this ridiculous rule. Not only did they not make the beds they didn\'t clean anything...the only notable change to the room was the bathroom bin had been emptied. Once we removed out nightwear from our beds the following day the beds were then made however the rest of the room was not...for a full 6 days! I informed housekeeping and nothing was done. The hotel had to in fact give us two free nights as the service and attitude of the staff there was so bad. Although they did this it does not make up for the stress and hassle we experienced on our holiday and I would never ever stay there again and I urge others not to.'
5,'Like home','The location is excelent. My room was confortable, clean and with a great view. But the most important was the friendly and helpful staff. If you intend to stay here, ask for Evelyn at the front desk, a special employee whom helped me so much, that I thought I was home.'
2,'Second visit, second disappointment','I stayed at this hotel in May and again in July for work. I wasn\'t impressed after the first visit. No shampoo, no soap. Room smell like cigarette smoke didn\'t seem clean. The curtins were barely hanging at the window and bath tub fixtures a bit rusty. Given the price, I thought I would try one more time. The second visit and room was worse. I only stayed one night and couldn\'t bear it for a second if I had to. The room smelled horrible and the ac was blowing barely cold air and I could find no controller. There had a regular fan in the room, which I ultimately turned on to far the air blowing out to blow away from me because of the smell. There was barely any water pressure to wash my hair. When I checked out, they didn\'t even bother to ask how my stay was. As side annoyance, they actually charged me $2 to hold my bag for a few hours because I was there before check in time.'
5,wow,'Hallo alle zusammen, ich war allein-reisender und habe in diesem Hotel übernachtet ,mir hat es sehr gut gefallen Personal war war sehr freundlich, Zimmer waren sehr sauber und damit gab es nichts zu meckern.\r\nIch kann dieses Hotel nur empfehlen.'
5,'Perfect, perfect,perfect!!','We just got back from a one night stay here. Perfect, perfect, perfect. First of all location you cannot beat. Heart of Times Square. The room is giant for being in NYC. The biggest plus is we are a family of 5 so the room has two double beds and a pull out couch! It was great. We didn\'t have to worry about a cot, or another room. The room was spacious, clean, and very pretty. Great views as well. Everyone working there was very friendly. When we got to the room the manager was in there to make sure everything was clean and she made sure it met our standards. The beds were very comfortable. The elevators are very fast and makes getting up to your room quick and easy. I will stay here every time I come to the city no questions asked. It was perfect, I really had not one complaint at all. Starbucks in the lobby how could you go wrong? 5 Stars well deserved!!!!!!'
3,'Great lobby & location; poorly kept rooms','I stayed at the Palmer House for work during August, 2012. Summarized below are the pros & cons of my stay:\r\nPros:\r\n*beautiful lobby\r\n*excellent service \r\n*great location for shopping and public transportation - the blue line will take you from O\'Hare to the Dearborne Street station very nearby for only $2.50\r\n*there\'s a Target a block away where you can get anything you need\r\nCons:\r\n*wallpaper peeling in multiple places in the hotel room\r\n*room walls were paper thin - could clearly hear the conversation in the room next to us\r\n*similarly, heard the train outside all night\r\n*unless you\'re a Hilton Honor silver or higher, plan on spending $10/day to work out in their fitness center'
5,'Mother/daughter weekend','I\'ve stayed in many NY hotels and this is one of the nicest. Great location, quiet (even though near Times Square, spacious rooms, very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. All the staff is extremely professional and helpful. Highly recommend choosing this site.'
1,'Bad experience: Rooms not ready, valet damaged car, etc.','I am very disappointed with the whole Hyatt experience. I reserved two king rooms for two nights with Grand Hyatt, Manhattan for the Memorial Day weekend. Here are some of the bad experiences that we faced during our stay at the Grand Hyatt:\r\n(1) We arrived at the Grand Hyatt at around 7 pm hoping to check-in and change for a nice dinner with family and friends after a whole day of travel. I was told there were no rooms available even though we had reservations. Rather than offering an upgrade, the receptionist actually offered a downgrade to two queen rooms. When we said that will not work and asked when our rooms will be ready, the receptionist did not have any idea when the rooms will be available. We ended up going to the dinner without even being able to freshen up or change. I got a phone call around 10 pm saying my rooms were ready. \r\n(2) Once we checked into the room, the head board was dusty; sofa was dirty with brown and yellow stains on it.\r\n(3) The air conditioners in both rooms were not working properly. We had to set it to 65 degrees, the coldest, and the room was still warm.\r\n(4) I handed the car to the valet parking service outside the building when I checked in. We left the car parked for the entire two days while we toured the city. After checking out, we had to wait 30 minutes for the valet attendant to bring the car back. What was even worse was the rear passenger side door on the driver’s side of the car was completed scraped. The attendant who delivered the car blocked the scrape with his body as he handed us the keys and standing in front of the door while my daughter got in her seat. We only noticed the damage to the car when we stopped at the first rest stop, nearly two hours later.\r\nI called the Grand Hyatt to complain about the damage to my car and all they had to offer was that Hyatt is not responsible for the parking company since they do not run the parking service. No one mentioned this to me when I checked in to Hyatt. There is only one valet company operating outside of the Hyatt front door, so I was surprised to hear Hyatt not offering to help in any manner. When I called the valet company, they said that the damage was already there when they picked up the car. This is an outright lie since the damage has fresh paint. I have pictures and a video showing the damage.\r\nOverall, this vacation turned out to be a bad one due to the above experiences at the Grand Hyatt.'
3,'Hype but nothing to back it up!','My husband stayed here for 4days. We were in NYC to celebrate his birthday. Because of that, when we checked in we asked about upgrading to the Club Level. The young man at the desk quoted us an extra $100 per night---saying that it was worth because of the breakfast, happy hour with appetizers, etc. He also said he would put us into a really nice room.\r\nWell, the room was very small and worse, the sliding doors for the closet were off the track and my husband could not move them back on. He called the desk and they did put us into another room, that was considerably bigger then the first.\r\nWe were surprised to learn that happy hour didn\'t include free drinks--infact a glass of cheap wine was $9! On the plus, both the breakfast and appetizers were very nice.\r\nWe learned on the 2nd day of the trip that the Club was closing the next day. Wish that had been mentioned at the time we checked in!! Needless to say we did not pay for the days when the Club was not available.\r\nAlthough the hotel has recently undergone a massive renovation, it is clear that the workmanship is very inadequate. We already found wallpaper coming off in the cornors, paint peeling off the door frame.\r\nService is ok, but not anything special.\r\nThe location is great, right next to Grand Central Terminal and an easy walk to the Theatre District.\r\nI thought the hotel would be special because it is a Grand Hyatt and because of the renovation but it didn\'t live up to the hype of its ads.'
4,'Great Location','Had a wonderful 2 night stay. The Hotel staff were very helpful. I fell in the lobby, slipping on wet tile on not so great boots while pregnant. I had staff rushing from every where to help. I was fine just clumsy.\r\nWe thought the room was wonderful. Clean, and spacious...lots of pillows!\r\nI was disappointed however that I went all the way to the pool that is actually in hotel but part of a fitness club...and they wanted us to purchase a swim cap. who brings money to the pool? I went back up to the room got the $ but by the time I got back to the pool cold, and pregnant I was put off and changed my mind. The use of this fitness facility is extra and not included unless you are a club Marriott member. Be sure to ask questions when booking.\r\nWe assumed it would be included.\r\nOtherwise, close to broadway and action. Have a blast!'
3,Geschaeftshotel,'Rundum Guter Service! Problemloses Ein- und Auschecken. Sehr guter Zimmerkomfort. Das Frühstückbuffet bot die typischen amerikanischen „Delikatessen als auch eine kleine Auswahl asiatischer Spezialitäten. Der Roomservice war schnell. Die Ausstattung des Zimmer perfekt und ideal für den Geschäftsreisenden. Komme gerne wieder'
4,'gorgeous Chicago landmark','The Palmer House was beyond what we had hoped for. We were guests of a large wedding party who had set aside a block of rooms. Check-in was a little difficult at 3pm, there was a huge line. Other than that, the rooms were clean & beautiful, despite the long walk from the elevators to our room. The lobby is gorgeous. Great location.'
5,'Great Room, Awesome SERVICE','I first booked one night then extended my stay because of the awesome room and most of all because of the amazing service that JENNY provided. Whatever I needed was taken care of by Jenny and her amazing backup staff. Felt a lot like CHEERS as everyone always greeted me and asked if there was anything they could do to help. Room size is cozy and quiet. Just loved it here and can\'t wait to go back.'
4,'Great location','The location of this hotel can\'t be beat - near the Art Institute and Millenium Park, as well as a mile or so from the Shedd Aquarium and other attractions. I was upgraded to the Executive Floor, which featured a newly decorated room (it seemed like it anyway!), a bit on the small side, but not too bad. Bathroom was quite small, however. We really enjoyed using the executive lounge, which had a pretty good selection of treats at all times of day. Well worth it really for all four of us! Concierge was really helpful. Lobby was stunning, but didn\'t hang out there.'
4,'Fab treat!','We stayed here in May-05. It was a birthday present from my very lovely friends.\r\nWhilst in general I think downtown is a much better location - if you can\'t stay there then Time Square is just the place to be.\r\nThe staff were friendly & welcoming, the lifts delightfully scary & I loved the interior. \r\nThe rooms were clean, cosily welcoming & how can you beat that view - we had a room on the 32nd floor & it was amazing. I almost wanted to sleep in a chair next to the floor to ceiling window.\r\nThe breakfast was great & the revolving restaurant (amazing view) had fantastic cocktails.\r\nHowever considering the cost (for same time next year the cheapest come up as $379, ) the room itself is nothing special.\r\nIf you can get a cheap deal or really want to splash out - it\'s the place to be though...'
4,week-end,'abbiamo passato 4 giorni per visitare new york sotto le festivita\' natalizie. ce lo avavano consigliato, in effetti e\' veramente giusto, vicinissimo al centro, bello, le camere (anche se piccoline), sono veramente pulite, il personale gentilissimo e disponibile. noi facevamo la prima colazione, in un camerone molto vecchio ma arredato in modo ottimo, penasate che l\'altezza totale dal pavimento e\' cira di 8/10metri e la camera e\' chiamte library, perche\' ? e\' si e\' circondati da libre, ma tantissimi !!! poi la mattina che siamo andati via, ci hanno lasciato la camera fino alle 12 poi i bagagli li hanno tenuti loro custoditi visto che noi il volo era alla sera.\r\nda ritornarci sicuramente !!!'
3,'Excellent Location on a Budget','This hotel is in a brilliant location allowing you easy access to the sites in New York. They are in the process of renovating the hotel (althought the work is not disruptive). The first room we stayed in was on the 3rd floor which was very shabby, we actually moved rooms as there was a mouse. We were moved to floor 12 which is an already renovated floor, as is floor 7 so I guess that they are working from the top down. Rooms on the renovated floor are clean, very spacious and the showers are good. Towels were changed, rooms tided and beds made daily. Hotel staff were helpful and although we had a mouse in our first room I would still return to this hotel on my next trip to New York as it is such good value for money. I would definately recommend it.'
5,'Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!','Wonderful staff. Fantastic location. Although the bathroom was small it was functional, tidy and the toiletries were Devine. The kitchenette was an absolute bonus allowing us to store and warm food. Very nice luxurious beds. There\'s a laundry there too so no need to trudge the laundry to a laundromat. It was just beautiful overall.'
5,'Another great stay at the Palmer House','Whenever I travel to Chicago, I stay at the Palmer House if at all possible. It is very close to the metro and bus stops as well as the theater district and restaurants. The inside is just beautiful as well. Seems that there are many different sizes of rooms, some are a little small but still comfortable and some are quite large. All are clean and very well decorated. Noise has never been a problem for me at the hotel. The staff has always been helpful. This visit I chose to attend a BlackHawks game...they provided all the necessary details on what buses to take there and back and it definitely reduced my anxiety.'
4,'Nice Hotel, Fabulous Location','This is a huge hotel located in the center of New York City action. We love attending plays, and the hotel is literally only a few minute walk from multiple theaters and less than a block from the half-price ticket booth. Our room was large by New York standards, very clean, and the shower was awesome. Although housekeeping did an exceptional job of maintaining the room, we were disappointed to return to the hotel just after 6 pm one day intending to take a nap before an evening play, only to discover that our room hadn\'t been cleaned yet (we had left the hotel at around 11 am that day). Other than that we were well satisfied with our stay. Our 10th floor room had no view, but that was just the luck of the draw.'
4,'The Grand, grand in many areas and not so grand in others....','OK, we visited the Grand for 1 week. We(my and my 5yr. old son) met my husband who was in New York for work.\r\nPROS- Great location of Hotel, close to all\r\nOur room; we were upgraded (used a suite upgrade coupon) which was a very large room with sitting room. This was great so our son could sleep in a bit and we had 2 closets to store suitcases, etc.... The room was on the 18th floor, which is a bit misleading and is actually the 8th floor. ( I think they just want you to think you are on a higher floor than you actually are so they\'ve added 10 floors to each level) Since we were on the 8th, our view was a large wall of the Grand Central Station and an office bldg. On the the 8th floor we were unlucky to hear the garbage truck come by a few times starting at 7am or so. (I\'ve included a photo) Keep in mind, I\'d rather have the larger room and deal with the not so great view and noise from the trash trucks, it is a city after all.\r\nThe Doormen were very helpful, esp. the man who gave my son a huge lollypop everyday! It was always easy enough to get a cab with their help. \r\nBEST part of the hotel was the concierge (Chris) on the Club Floor. He went out of his way to make our trip the best it possibly could, he got us the most amazing tix to the Lion King, dinner reservations that were right on and he just had the best personality and I am sure represents everything Hyatt wants to represent in regards customer service. He even helped out with last minute passport problem we had! (same day passport was achieved)\r\nOK, the not so grand....\r\nDesign of the bathroom was in need of help. The sink was almost as small as a pedistal sink, there was no where to put any items. (though they did have a little shelf across the bathroom) I think they are updating/remodeling, if so I\'m sure the bathrooms will be updated.\r\nWe had a few problems with the room within the first few days:\r\n1. the room was dark, (due to the view of a wall) and one of the large stand-up lamps was broken. I called to have an engineer come and fix, 4 hours later no one showed up. I had to call again and they lamp was broken, they did replace it.\r\n2. 1/2 way though the trip the airconditioner went out (or would not turn on) in our main room with the bed. I also put a call in for that and never heard back. I didn\'t want to wait around for someone to fix it so I just let it go, it was not very hot anyway.\r\n3. Our last night my son and I went to dinner (about 6pm) and asked the doorman for an umbrella (tons of rain), he said I need to go back up in the hotel registration and get one from the front desk for a deposit of $100. OK, that\'s fine..... I\'m not going to steal the 4 foot bright orange Hyatt umbrella, but OK. Long story short no umbrellas! None, zip, nothing. Come on you should have more umbrelllas than you have rooms, it was not fun trying to walk down a city street with a toddler in the rain. The young man at the front desk (I\'ll withhold his name) was extremely rude....nice no umbrellas.\r\nOverall we had a great experience for a good city price.'
4,'Best Location!!','I found this old, Art Deco era hotel to be a diamond in the rough. Located just steps from Times\r\nSquare, it presents a nostalgic alternative to the fancy new and sterile chain hotels, The staff were so friendly and welcoming, the room was clean and comfortable, the bed was comfy, and everything I needed was right there. I will stay here again. In fact, I liked it so much that I probably wouldn\'t bother looking for any other place to stay in NYC! It\'s maybe not for everyone, \r\nas the bathrooms are small and the rooms are dated. But for me, it only added to the ambiance.\r\nIt would be nice to have a coffee maker in the room, though.'
4,'Top Lage -für amerikanische Verhälnisse gut.','Vorweg: Das Westin ist für amerikanische Verhältnisse recht gut, aber auch nur dann wenn man nicht genau hinschaut. Aber wir sind in New York, Manhatten.....und da ist man so oder so nicht oft im Hotel. Allerdings Allerdimgs kann ich wirklich keine 5 Punkte vergeben wie die meisten Bewerter vor mir!! Schliesslich zahlt man ja für das Zimmer.\r\nWir kamen spät am Abend an und erhielten ein upgrade in eine Suite ( als sPG Platinum ) . Die Suite war ein etwas grösseres Zimmer, Bett und Sitzecke durch eine den Raum trennende Wand aufgeteilt. Als wir anfingen auszupacken sahen wir dass \r\ndas Zimmer gar nicht gereinigt war. Offene Seifen im Badezimmer, Handtücher am Boden etc.. Natürlich kann das mal passieren, aber nach einem Continental Flug ist es selbstverständlich nervend. Gut..wir gingen Essen und sagten bescheid. Das zimmer war dann aufgeräumt, aber Sauber ist was anderes. Sagen wir es war O.K. Als Platinum Members hatten wir freien Zugang zur Atrium Lounge und freiem Frühstück. Das Frühstück war sehr beschränkt, Müsli, süsse Teile und Marmelade und Frischkäse und Kaffee. Natürlich wird man satt, aber unter Frühstück versteht man in Deutschland etwas anderes. Auch die Atmosphäre in der Lounge war ungemütlich....aber wir sind ja in New York und das Frühstück war für uns ja umsonst. Unser Zimmerpreis ( eine Woche vorher noch von 380 $ auf 320 $ umgebucht war o.k für Manhatten. Insofern könen wir das Hotel auch empfehlen vorallem wegen der Lage.\r\nUnd in eigener sache freuen wir uns gern über einen Hotel Tip in NY...natürlich zahlen wir auch gerne mehr wenn es sich lohnt.\r\ndas Zimmer gar nicht'
4,'What a great stay','Due to Superstorm Sandy we had to move hotel a number of times to secure accomodation for each night our delayed stay. From the 3 hotels we stayed at the New Yorker was by far the best, though reading other comments we may have struck lucky. Situated on the 35th floor one of our rooms had a view of the Empire State Builiding to die for and the other room had 3 windows, 2 facing the Hudson river. The location was very good but as our 4 day stay in New York had been extended to 10 days we\'d become used to walking everywhere, so no doubt our fitness levels had increased.\r\nThe staff we met were friendly including reception, transportation, and bell boys. Can only recommend this hotel based on our experience. Rooms clean and large, certainly didn\'t have to dance with our cases to get pass.'
5,Tremendous,'this hotel can be very deceptaive from the entrance as you cannot tell what a hidden gem is inside.\r\n everything about this hotel is excellent,high quality.the hotel staff went out of their way to be so helpful,they were always so happy to be of service.\r\nthe room was excetionally clean and kept to this standard during our stay.\r\nthe bed was not very high off the floor but very comfatable,the decor is of a very high standard,the bathroom was compact but served it\'s purpose excellent shower facility.'
4,'Excellent central hotel','The location of the hotel is perfect, close to shops, restaurants and attractions. Check in with Jimmy was speedy and friendly with no fuss. We used the hotel safety deposit with no charge, which was hassle free. The rooms whilst being small and alittle dated were clean and comfortable. Full marks for a very comfy bed. We were concerned after reading poor reviews but are pleased to say our stay was trouble free and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.'
5,'The Amazing Edison Hotel','I love the Edison Hotel in New York City!\r\nThe staff and friendly, they cater to a budget conscious traveller - yet have a beautiful hotel in the Theatre and Times Square district!\r\nYou will love it!!!!'
4,'Ci tornerò!','Posizione davvero ottima a 50 metri da Times Square. Colazione abbondante x2 inclusa nel prezzo (da pagare solo la mancia, circa 1,25$) nel bar accanto all\'albergo. Camera non tenuta benissimo ma più che fattibile visto che intanto stando a nyc ci si va solo per dormire. Bagno pulito. Abbiamo trovato una promozione che ci ha permesso di risparmiare ben il 30\% sul totale...altrimenti sarebbe un pò caretto.'
5,Fantastic!!!!,'Well i can\'t beleive some of the negative posts. This hotel is quality. It is sandwiched between grand central terminal and the chrysler building. Both are probably the nicest looking buildings in the city. \r\nThe location is superb being so close to grand central it is a quick subway ride to anywhere in manhatten. It is also only a short walk to many of the main sites in New York. It even has its own entrance to grand central.\r\nRooms are large, and i mean large it was a clear 5 or 6 steps to the granite desk. There is a large comfy chair and an office chair at the desk. A walk in wardrobe, an iron and ironing board is also provided. \r\nThe bathroom is an adequate size for what you need to do in there. Although the bath is not very deep but that maybe the way all American baths are.\r\nThe bed is amazing to sleep in, probably the most comftable bed ever. \r\nThe photo\'s on the Grand Hyatt website are just what the hotel is like, unlike allot of other hotels i have stayed in.\r\nCheck in was quick and there was a room ready even though we were early (11:00). Staff at concierge were polite and very efficient, they could not of been any more helpfull.\r\nIn fact my only gripe is that they charged us $2 a bag when we needed to leave our bags as we had a late flight home. Surely a hotel of this quality could provide this service gratis?\r\nObviously this is my own experience of the hotel, this hotel is huge so there is obviously going to be some problems. It is just a shame that negative comments are written more than positives.'
4,'location is it','You\'re probably here for the location, which is the top selling feature of this hotel.\r\nTHE hotel in the heart of Times Square. Really, right outside, TKTS booth steps and the area where everyone congregates to hang out and take photos. You\'re across the street from The Lion King, and eventually Evita will be downstairs, and Ghost the Musical will also be across the street. You can\'t get any more central than this.\r\nThe room was fine. I did not ask for a TS view, so looked more into the office building across the street.\r\nThe elevator system is probably the most entertaining thing (kids will likely love to play here). At the large bank of elevators (in a semi-circle), you enter your floor number, and it tells you which letter elevator to go to. This computer elevator traffic control is handy for such a big hotel. Also, the elevators are see-through, so you can watch the outside floors pass by quickly. Probably not great for those with fear of heights or vertigo, but entertaining and kind of a rush.\r\nFor me, however, I think this is probably too big a hotel. It felt more like an office building than hotel. You enter from TS and need to take the elevator to the 8th floor for the Lobby. I prefer either more of a boutique hotel, or one with a real lobby as you walk in from the street. But perhaps a minor thing.'
5,'Labor Day Stay at Palmer House','We are VIP Gold HH members and Hilton Vacation Club owners, so we expect a lot when we stay with Hilton. We were not dissapointed with our last stay at the Hilton Palmer House in Chicago. We knew it was going to be a very busy weekend with the last holiday of the summer and the jazz festival in town but we went anyway. We took advantage of the prepaid stay with the breakfast buffet and felt the price was very reasonable. We automatically got the upgrade to the suite and had full benefits of the executive level amenities. We were very happy with both the service we recieved and the food we were served. We like the parking arrangement with the garage next door and the friendly help from the bell hops. We enjoyed a newly renovated room with excellent internet serivce and more than friendly room service. I think we called them 4 times with request in just one day and they came through with everything from wine openers to extra sheets for the rollaway. We really liked the old world charm of this hotel but it was not too over the top. Location is prefect to explore Chicago. We have young kids and we like the way they cater to families with children. You don\'t have to worry about what others are thinking because they all seem to have kids too. Nothing worse than going somewhere and have people act like you shouldn\'t have brought your kids. We make sure our kids don\'t bother people too, so that helps. Thanks Pamler House staff for a great Labor Day weekend.'
4,'Location, location, location','Great location toward the uptown end of Times Square - high rise enough to be out of the noise. Great views. Lots of visitors from overseas adds a global character. \r\nBut it is expensive... breakfast will run $30 or more! The bar is convenient - pleasant - but 4 drinks was $75. with tip. Cars, valet, doormen - it is all palm Sunday as they have a hand out for their tip.\r\nOne downside... the elevators are wholly inadequate -- the wait for a ride can be interminable. Bad design or just too many customers? Admittedly a small annoyance.'
5,'Beautiful Hotel and New York Experience','We recently stayed at this hotel for the weekend. The location is perfect. It\'s across the street from MOMA and only a block from Rockerfeller Ctr. Because we belong to the Hilton Rewards Club, we also got tickets for their breakfast buffet, which was suppose to be $33! a piece, but we got it free with membership. Let me tell you, the buffet was very impressive. There were about 5 stations set up. Excellent! The location of this hotel, the price, the staff, etc. made our New York experience one to remember. I plan on staying here every time I visit NYC.'
5,'Even better the 2nd time','Stayed 2 nights on a slow weekend (snowed in ny). The lobby was not as busy as the last time, and we were able to check in easily requesting 2 beds. Note: each set of elevators goes to certain floors so you need to stick with the same ones each time. We got the 8th floor (HHonors), and the room was a renovated one. The decor was nice, bathroom was clean, bed very comfortable, 27 LCD tv and safe in the closet. They offer Crabtree & Evelyn prods: shampoo, conditioner, body lotion & shower cap. They even have these adjustable lamps on the headboards of the beds for reading. They have a starbucks inside the hotel and a regular one across the street. The restaurant has a nice looking bar but we did not dine there. Plenty of banks around the area, too: Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia etc. Times Square is less than a mile from the hotel. I won this hotel on priceline for $115 bid. After my bad experience at Intercontinental Barclay, I decided to never include Midtown East as an area to stay. Plus it\'s more convenient since we were seeing broadway musicals for both days of our stay. The hotel is close to the orange and yellow lines, 5th Ave, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, MOMA. We got back late from eating after our evening musical, and it felt safe walking from the subway stop. This hotel does not offer complimentary internet, nor free wifi in the lobby. Our tv stopped working the next day (sound but no pic), but I forgot to report it to the desk when I checked out. I\'m not sure if it was due to the slow weekend, but we won the lottery drawing for $25-27 seats to Hair and In the Heights (certain broadway shows have these lottery drawings 2 hours before showtime - show up 10 minutes before the drawing to put your name in the bucket).'
4,'I\'ll stay here again','I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square in December 2011 over Christmas. I won this hotel in a blind bid on Priceline. \r\nI arrived very early in the morning and the front desk staff was kind enough to accommodate me into a room right away. My room was spacious, clean and quiet. The location was very convenient - in the middle of the theater district. \r\nThe only problem I found with my room, was it was a bit warm. I was told by staff that air conditioning was not available because it was turned off for the season. However I was able to open the window to cool it down. Unfortunately, I couldn\'t get the window totally closed. The room did stay a reasonable temperature, but having a window that opens that high up was a little disconcerting. \r\nAll-in-all, it was a wonderful stay. I would highly recommend this hotel.'
4,'¨Excelente la atencion y muy lindo hotel¨','Barato, accesible, excelente atención, especialmente por el señor de recepcion llamado Saleem, muy simpático y agradable. Muy buena ubicación.'
3,'overall ok experience','Stayed for 3 nights and 4 days, didn\'t check in until late at night, but staff was friendly in lobby, because it was newly renovated, the lighting & A/C systems in the room was a little bit difficult to control, it was like a touch/sensor thing and it never works the way you want it to, whenever I want to dim the lights a bit, either nothing happens, or everything is turned off, same thing with the A/C temperature change, it\'s always easier to crank the temp up than to turn it down. Luggage hold at concierge was $2 per piece, which I find a little bit ridiculous given that I just spent over $700 on my entire stay, I thought they\'d be able to do something better than to actually charge their clients. Other than that, location was great, staffs were friendly, but hallway a bit noisy because they do group bookings, and at that time there was a big group of kids that came and stayed, they were running in the lobby, in the hallway, just kind of irritated. Also didn\'t like the fact there was no free internet access.'
2,'Certainly not Grand - just OK','If you like your hotels big, bland and Corporate then this place could be for you.\r\nHaving arrived from a stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Chicago the change in service level was immediate and never improved. Its not that the staff were rude - it just seemed that they couldn\'t be bothered.\r\nThe room however was very good, it was clean with adequate bathroom facilities. I had requested a quiet room(mine was on the 20th floor)which seemed to work as the room was quiet with no interconnecting door to the next room and traffic noise was not a problem. The decor on the way to the room was awful - dirty brown walls,dirty brown carpet and dirty brown door to the room - come on Hyatt cheer the place up!!\r\nBy the time I\'d asked for an extended check out time on the last day when the bored answer came back that we are fully booked today - by then I couldn\'t be bothered to argue and myself and my colleages just booked our bags later into the bored bell staff.\r\nHaving read all the reports on this hotel on Tripadvisor I knew I should have changed our reservations there does seem to be a theme in a lot of the reviews.\r\nIn conclusion this hotel does have a great location and if you get a good or discounted room rate - go for it and it will be OK. I\'m going back to New York hopefully in a months time and will not be staying at the Hyatt.\r\nHappy Travelling'
4,'TRES BIEN','hôtel très bien situé, au coeur de times square, la première chambre qu\'on nous a donné ne nous convenait pas, retour à l\'accueil petite discussion avec tips et grande chambre au 37 ième étage chambre 3704 propre, rien à dire sur le personnel, nous n\'avons pas vue grand monde car départ trés tôt de la chambre et retour tard le soir!!! faut bien profiter de new york!!\r\nnous n\'avions pas pris le petit déjeuner à l’hôtel (trop cher) mais il est facile de déjeuner tout prés (europa café en sortant par times square sur la droite ou un delis en sortant à gauche)\r\nliterie parfaite.'
4,'Se non sei perspicace non ti accorgi del moderno hotel Hudson','L\'hotel non è dotato di una insegna fuori, ma è illluminato in modo sobrio di giallo.\r\nSale mobili che ti accompagnano all\'ingresso con un lampadario immenso ed elegante.\r\nLuci soffuse in ogni angolo dell\'hotel, tutto molto soft, camere pulite e ben curate, piccole, consiglio in tal senso le superior queen.\r\nBagno dignitoso, e devo dire servizio di pulizia e nella lobby ottimo e gentile.\r\nColazione a pagamento sui 20 $ in due..Posizione ottima con un ristorante accanto di sushi buono e vicino alla 8th Avenue e a Central Park. Unica nota dolente, bloccano la carta di credito per la durata del soggiorno, come alcuni hotel di Ny..Cmq lo consiglio vivamente..'
5,'Overall a very good hotel','I\'ve stayed here many times for business and have only been dissapointed with a few small things such as keys not working, no one answering the guest service hotline, etc. but overall this is a very solid property. I understand that these things will happen and the front desk staff is always quick to help. It also offers a great location, very good restaurants and a good workout facility. Given the age and size of the building the staff does a very good job of running things. Only drawback is that it sells out quick.'
5,'nifty, cozy find','Palmer House Hilton is a nifty and special find. The rooms are a little on the small side, and older than some of the other Hiltons but clean and have a lot of character. The staff was pleasant, location was fabulous, and just an all around fabulous hotel! It\'s right around the corner from the Chicago Art Institute, 15 minute walk from the magnificent mile, there\'s a pool and exercise facilities. I love this place and will definitely be returning on my next trip to Chicago.'
4,'Great place to stay','The rooms are typical New York. Small but modern and everything you need. I booked this trip knowing that the hotel rooms were small and others had complained about them. Lets face it, when you\'re in New York, how much time do you actually spend in the room? As long as you have a bed to rest your feet, it doesn\'t matter how much space you have. The rooms were clean, tidy and modern. \r\nThe hotel is very close to Columbus Circle, Central Park and the well known once called Hells KItchen. It\'s only a 5 minute walk to 5th Avenue too. I would definitely stay here again.'
4,'Beautiful Hotel','I think this hotel is a great value, right in the heart of Chicago. I would have given it 5 stars if my hotel room window had a better view than the opposite wall of the building and if the beds were actually queen like they claim to be and not doubles. On a more positive note, there is a free pool and hot tub to use and the hotel foyer (if you can even call it that, maybe atrium) is amazing. This place definitely makes a statement from the moment you walk in and see the 3 story high ceilings, painted Sistine Chapel-esque. There is a bar in the foyer as well as bars and restaurants off the sides. One thing to note is that this hotel is HUGE which could be a pro or con depending on your purpose. I think ideally this place is just perfect for a convention which I was not a part of, but still enjoyed myself.'
5,Fabulous,'I stayed here for 4 nights with my fiance + we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The staff were very friendly + professional, the room was spotlessly clean + it was nice + big! The bed was one of the comfiest beds I\'ve ever slept in!\r\nThe room is very well double glazed - it\'s hard to believe that Times Square is just outside the window when it\'s so quiet inside! We didn\'t have any meals at the hotel but the rom service menu looked appetizing + it wasn\'t too expensive. We had no problems with the lifts - we didn\'t have to wait too long - to be honest though, I wouldn\'t let a lift ruin my holiday!!!\r\nI would have no hesitation at all in staying here again + I would highly recommend it. Enjoy!'
4,'New Year in the New Yorker','We stayed here for a 6 nights to spend New years eve in Time Square. We took the subway from the airport which was very easy and arrived right outside the hotel. The hotel itself is local to the Empire State Building and within easy walking distance to Times Square, theatre district etc.The hotel room was basic but great for what we needed, we looked out to the Crysler Building. My only complaint to the hotel is that the safety deposit boxes are behind the reception desk and whenever you need to get to your safe you have to join the same queue as those checking in or out. You have a key and the reception has a key and they come to the safe and open it for you.One day I queued for 19 minutes, then accidently turned the key before closing the door, therefore I couldn\'t lock the door, I spent what seemed like a lifetime trying to get the attention of the reception to come and help me. They need to have a bell to ring to get some attention.\r\nA must is the New York travel pass, I have just worked out that I would have spent over $145 if I had paid individally for each attraction I visited, also I had a metro pass which was also well worth the money.You can use this on the busses as well as the subway.'
5,'Great Location and we\'ll be back!','Great Location, walk to Central Park, to Angelo\'s for Pizza or across the street to Whole Foods and the Columbus street Subway station or down to the Broadway theater. Pharmacy across the street, good yogurt place a few doors down and a good little breakfast joint as well. An easy ride to La Guardia, take subway to Columbia University and transfer to the M60 Bus all for a couple of dollars. Our room was small and cute but functional and quite cozy. Absolutely the best place to stay!'
2,'Dark Rooms dated decor but wonderful staff','You have to pity the excellent staff at this hotel. Their good work is let down by the quality of the facilities. Every encounter with the staff was pleasant and all my requests were fulfilled. \r\nThe decor was at one time excellent - 1988. \r\nThe room i got was dark and the bathroom was small and smelled musty.\r\nThere were no light fixtures in the room - only lamps. The room felt worn and dated. I could see the dust in the carpets around the doors. \r\nThe elevators had worn call buttons and the corridors leading to the rooms, although wide were dark.\r\nI was there on a business conference. The conference facilities were very good. The staff managed food and beverage service very efficiently. The quality of the food was also quite nice.\r\nStay here if you get a really cheap rate or your company is paying for it. There could be no complaint about the location.'
1,'Employees steal your stuff- Stay Away!','My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania during the first week in August, and the room was what we expected from reading the reviews - an ok (I didn\'t say good) place to sleep in NYC for the location/price. The room wasn\'t nice by any means, but we weren\'t planning on hanging out in the hotel all day, so we figured it would serve it\'s purpose, but we just wouldn\'t recommend it to our friends. \r\nThat all changed on our 3rd night there when we came back from a day at Ellis Island to find my laptop and charger had been stolen from my case inside our locked room. Apparently, this is a common problem at this hotel. Another couple had their wallet stolen the day before my laptop dissapeared. If you do chose to stay here, please protect your belongings and don\'t leave anything in your (locked) room that you don\'t want the employees helping themselves to.'
5,'Great location Great hotel','I stayed here in early April for 4 nights with 2 friends. We got a double room, two bathrooms, it was one of the brightest rooms I have stayed in while in New York. The location is great, we got the train in from JFK to Penn station and it was literally around the corner. It offers good access whether going uptown or downtown, we were able to visit a lot of the city on foot. We didn\'t eat at the hotel but there are plenty of places nearby.'
4,'Easy and inexpensive choice','When rooms in NYC can be over $500 a night the Westin is a great value. The rooms are nicely decorated and clean, the beds are comfortable and the bedding is luxurious. For tourists looking to enjoy Times Square, the Westin is in a great location. I definitely recommend this jotel\''
4,'Would recommend to anyone looking for convenience and value','Stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania Nov. 15 & 16, 2006 while in NY on business; one of five trips to NY in 2006. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a convenient place to sleep and store your personal belongings while visiting New York. It just a few blocks from the Empire State Bldg, Broadway, Times Square, etc.\r\nI paid $199 here at a time when other hotels were charging $400 to $500 at night. After reading all of the reviews here (mostly negative) I have to say I was expecting much worse conditions than I found. At check-in I requested one of the new rooms that I read about on Tripadvisor and the front desk clerk upgraded me to an executive suite at no extra charge. The room was fairly spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a 3- to 4-star hotel. It even had a small refrigerator in it - something you don\'t get in NY very often, even at hotels charging twice as much. I would describe the hotel quality as somewhere between Holiday Inn and Marriott. This was definitely the busiest hotel I\'ve ever stayed at; mostly school groups and international visitors. The most memorable attribute was the freakin\' water pressure in the shower. (Good!) It was like standing in front of a fire hydrant. Never went cold on me though.\r\nPlease tip maids and service workers well wherever you travel. Tips mean so much to these people.'
4,'Great location','I stayed at the Park Central for a business trip. The building is older but has been updated over the years. Rooms are small, wi-fi was a bit expensive at $14+ a night - especailly since you can get free wi-fi at a cafe right next door, had a problem with our door key not always unlocking the door, and it was really warm in the room - there was only a heater, no fan or AC to cool it down (luckily we figured out that you could crack a window open at night) but the staff was very helpful, housekeepers were really nice, rooms were clean, and hotel was relatively quiet. Had a hard time figuring out the stairs - we were on the 5th floor and the elevators took forever as they were on a log in system, and when we tried the stairs, it took us to a service area rather than the lobby. Wish they would have been marked better - we were not the only ones who were getting lost on them! Hotel is within walking distance of so many attactions - if you are willing to put on the miles, it you can save alot on taxi $$. Great pizza places, delis, and bakeries next to hotel, very safe part of town. We had an afternoon flight out, and when we talked to Elizabeth at the front desk, she was kind enough to let us stay an extra hour past checkout so we wouldn\'t have to pay the baggage fee to keep our bags in the lobby while we got breakfast and walked around Central Park. Overall, I would stay there again.'
4,'Excellent location','My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights in April 2011. We got a last minute deal so the price was fairly reasonable. Our room was very clean and spacious and we had a nice enough view of the city. We didn\'t eat in the hotel but the deli straight across the road was ideal for breakfast. The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent so we couldn\'t fault it.'
5,Perfect,'Right location, right level of comfort, stunning view and access to a private lounge away from the hustle and bustle. All in all very good stay and the staff were excellent and informative.'
5,'heaven on earth','Wow!!! this hotel for a 3 star is excellent, clean, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, big neat modern rooms with a excellent location- times square at your doorstep.\r\nWe loved this hotel, stayed 20-22 november- it was wicked, such big, clean rooms, and not pricey for new york at all. could not fault it.\r\ncomfortable- you could just sty in hotel!!!!\r\ndefinately one to book- we paid 90 pound per night!! not bad in the busiet part of the new york holiday season!!!!!'
1,'In a word: Yuck!','My one night stay was last week (June 2004). The good news: The room was a spacious suite. The bad news: The window-mounted air conditioner is at least 30 years old, and noisy. The room was dimly lit, had a flithy carpet and a dirty bathroom (hairs on floor and shower, empty shampoo bottle in shower, mold). The roller shades were broken. The bed and pillows were old and uncomfortable. The chair seats have little bounce left in them, and are also uncomfortable. Earplugs are recommended, as the old, heavy, doors slam each time a person exits their room - starting at 5:30 am. And - get this - you have to carry your bags down a flight of stairs to exit as the escalator only goes up. There are many other hotels in this price range, even in this vicinity, that are clean and cool and better. Stay here only if desperate.'
2,'If you want a sink with water don\'t stay here!','I read the reviews and thought It can\'t be that bad -- well it was. Overall the room was small but VERY clean and comfy. It IS very loud. So loud that on Friday night I had to hand the receptionist my ID to get my room because there was no way to actually hear her or for her to hear me. The staff were friendly. The worse part of my stay was that I had no water coming out of my sink one night and I told them the next morning -- nothing was fixed that night. My husband had to collect water in the bathtub for me to wash my hands in the sink. I complained and after a long (really long) argument with management I got a new room. The problem was all over the hotel so I think the infrastructure was not new when the hotel opened....'
2,'Da ristrutturare però.......','Soggiorno di 10gg fra aprile e maggio (gruppo familiare di 19 persone). Prenotate 6 camere che si equivalevano (la mia forse era la più spaziosa) Letti a 1 piazza e mezzo, pulizia giornaliera con cambio asciugamani, bagno sicuramente da rivedere, penoso ma pulito, posizione eccellente, veduta dalla finestra pessima (dava su un vicolo cieco e sporco) ma chissenefrega chiusura porta da riparare, prezzo buono. Se ci tornerei? Sì! Nonostante tutto, siamo stati benissimo! Eravamo al centro della città, cosa volere di più a quel prezzo!!!'
5,Excellent!,'I stayed here as part of a group of 11 in late May/Early June.\r\nThe location is sensational - right off Times Square - and they did us a really good deal for a 2night stay.\r\nThe hotel restaurant was lovely (great breakfast omelette!) and the staff were polite - our Asian waiter even spoke a few lines of Irish to us! The hotel bar is really cosy and comfortable - somewhere to enjoy a quiet drink in a relaxed ambiance.\r\nFour of us shared one room and found it to be spacious, well-lit and clean. The cleaning staff were very dilligent, always asking if we needed fresh towes etc.\r\nAll in all, we had a really pleasureable stay at Hotel Edison and I\'d certainly recommend it.'
2,'Location + Space, but very Noisy and Old','PROS: \r\nthe bed was GREAT - even had a pillow menu\r\nvery large room, especially for NYC\r\ngreat location\r\nroom had a mini-kitchen!\r\nwell stocked gym\r\nCONS:\r\nbathroom was VERY small, shower so small you can\'t avoid touching the walls\r\nolder rooms (beds seemed new)\r\nWiFi cost $14.95/day\r\nNOISY - could hear everything going on on the floor\r\nMy last con here leads me to a story... There was a group of girls staying in the room across the hall from me. But, I thought how much trouble could a bunch of girls be on a Thursday night? I went to bed at about 10pm - and was woken up at 10:30 by the noise of catcalls and thumping music. Yes, they had a stripper. On a Thursday night. \r\nNow, I do credit the hotel, someone must have called security - because by 10:45 a security guard knocked on their door and escorted out their guest. The girls quieted down.\r\nBut, all in all, not a great stay. Would not recommend for business travel. Would be okay for a family, or tourist looking for a hotel with a good location.'
3,'but they take dogs','HP is just about the most shopworn hotel I\'ve ever stayed in. The staff is nice and the lobby is fine. The location is terrific, but the rooms are pretty dreadful. It\'s just your basic old, shabby New York hotel. I\'m sort of stuck between 2 and 3 stars but I gave it the higher rating based on location. Being right across from Madison Square Garden and just down from the theater district and Times Square was very convenient. And did I mention they take dogs? Yep. We came to go to Westminster Dog Show and tons of the competitors with their human side kicks stayed at HP. Now THAT was fun!'
4,Location...,'We had our two broadway shows booked and didnt want to be reliant on finding a cab to get home. I didnt expect much but was pleasantly suprised - the room was large and clean (with the exception that two used mugs from midnight hot chocolate didnt get taken away during the morning clean - which is just plain odd!) The reception desk was very helpful, I was able to print my boarding passes for free and it was within walking distance of both our shows and the Rockefeller Center! Easy straight subway to the 9/11 memorial and a short cab ride to Central Park so all in all it helped us make the most of our short trip. Only gripe - please keep Starbucks open a little bit later to accommodate those post-show hot chocolates!'
1,'poor service in a great location','Other than the great location and clean rooms it is hard to find a positive with this hotel. We arrived at 11:00 AM and the room was not ready, understandably so. We came back at 2:45 PM and was told again the room was not ready as it was not 3:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, the room was miraculously ready. We stayed at the Executive level and found hard to believe that somehow they finished all rooms at once at 3:00 PM. The rooms are very noisy and one can hear everything from the adjacent rooms. Housekeeping is erratic and the maid got into the room while we were inside more than once without knocking. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that charges for using the fitness room, which we found outrageous. In addition to the high room charge (somehow expected for New York), they charge $18.99 for one day wireless Internet, almost double the usual rates elsewhere. They charge for literally everything (I guess they take cue from the airline industry): fitness room, faxes received, per-bag charge at the bell desk (this is a New York custom apparently), Internet etc. We had not used their laundry service. We had a fax sent to us in the morning, the guy at the bell desk said he could not find it, we decided to use the business center to have the stuff printed out (for which we were charged $12), only for a few hours later to be notified we had a fax (for which we were charged again - they waived the charge upon our complaint). Do not pay for the Executive level, it has nothing worth noting, it is always crowded as they do not check eligibility and the food selection is underwhelming at best. In addition, it takes forever for the elevators to arrive as the hotel is very big and therefore crowded. We decided to cut our stay short and leave in the evening instead of the following morning. Despite the fact we had prepaid for that night, they wanted to charge a late check-out fee and it took a while to explain that we had already paid for that night.\r\nIn summary, great location but very poor service even for New York standards. We\'ve had much better experience in New York at similar hotels for similar price.'
4,'Carolyn, Saleem and Ellen - if I owned a hotel, I\'d have them working for me...','I\'ve been staying at the Park Central Hotel for several years, several times a year. The property\'s OK, but the service is usually outstanding. Carolyn, Saleem and Ellen, who work at the Front Desk, are always incredibely friendly and helpful, always leaving me with a feeling that they actually care.'
5,'New York for New Year 08','Warm and welcoming is the best way fo descibing this hotel. My first impression when i walked up the stairs to the foyer was the grandeur of the place. Sure, it\'s a little dated, but that adds to the character.\r\nWe were in room 1607 which had a great view overlooking seventh avenue. In the distance we could see Times Square and directly below us was Madisson Sq garden.\r\nThe rooms are very comfortable and although we asked for a king size bed, they gave us two queen size. Didn\'t really matter though as a queen size is big enough for the two of us anyway, and we found ourselves with a choice of which to stay in on that particular night!\r\nThe room had it\'s own kitchen and although we only used the fridge and the sink, I suppose it is a nice addition.\r\nThe location of the hotel is brilliant. Walk north directly up 7th avenue and you got Times Square. Grab a cab south and your on the way to the statue of liberty etc. Basically, you are in a great central location.\r\nAs with most places in New York the food is very good. The room service is supplied by the restaurant next door. Try the Angus burger, the best we\'ve tasted.\r\nWe were in New York for 7 days over the New Year which was fantastic and the hotel didn\'t let us down one bit.\r\nOverall, I\'d recommend this hotel to anyone I know who is visiting New York. This hotel is in an ideal position if you were watching one of the big boxing flights at Madisson Square Garden. Let\'s Hope Hatton fights over there again!\r\nMy girlfriend and I have said we\'ll be back there at some point in the future and we\'d definitely be staying at the Affinia again.'
5,'Amazing hotel in the heart of broadway','My partner and I stayed in the crowne plaza hotel last year for a week whilst we were on holiday.\r\nIt is located in an AMAZING location right in the middle of broadway and Time square.\r\nCheck in was quick and easy, and our room which was located on the 30-something floor was massive with great views over the city.\r\nI could spend all day listing everything I loved about the hotel and the city - but in short - The crowne plaza was fabulous and so was the trip to NYC\r\nIt is located near quite a few subway stations, and also most of the major attractions of the city are easily walkable (ie the various shows, \'top of the rock\' 5th ave, etc)\r\nWe flew British Airways Glasgow to Newark via heathrow. The New Jersey Transit takes you to penn station, and then the hotel is only a short subway ride away to times square. You can\'t miss the hotel - aim for M+M world!\r\nWe didn\'t eat the in hotel - but there are loads of deli\'s, restaurants and take aways right outside if you want to experience REAL NYC cuisine.'
2,'Great for convention, subpar for Westin','The Westin chain has made a great comeback by providing comfort and service within a reasonable budget. They stumbled big time, however, in their new Times Square property. I have stayed at over 30 Westin properties and found personal service, clean rooms, and magnificent baths to be standard. Westin Times Square failed in each category. Rooms are significantly smaller than in other Westin in-city properties, and the Heavenly bath which usually means separate soaking tub and shower, was a typical hotel bathroom with a shallow tub. Minimal sink space.When I arrived, check in was disorganized, with no priority to Starwood members despite the sign and staff posted. Special requests for additional items in the room were noted on my reservation, re-written by the check in desk, but it still took over 7 hours and three requests, ending in a personal demand to see the manager, before I was able to get the minimal service. On top of that, the duvet on the bed (white linen) was stained with what was either cocktail sauce or Russian Dressing. Staff appeared miffed when I asked that at least the cover be removed and changed. Again, what would have been done in a matter of minutes at any other Westin took hours to accomplish here. It\'s obvious that ths hotel is aiming for an upscale convention crowd -- tons of meeting rooms (but a tiny bar) Lobby looks like an airport lounge. In short, this should be a high end Sheraton, not a Westin. It is, to paraphrase Saturday Night Live, Not ready for Prime Time. A good choice for people with lower expectations who will spend their time in Theaterland or at the Convention Center, but priced beyond its value. There are better hotels in New York at this price, with better service.'
3,'Great Place to Stay.','The Edison Hotel is an older hotel in the Times Square area. The rooms are small but clean. The bathroom is especially small. Even though these two statements are true, I am still recommending this hotel. The location is really wonderful. The Edison is 1/2 block from Times Square Tickets Booth and the wonderful steps to sit by and people watch. Subways, theater, and restaurants are all within an easy walking distance. The staff is courteous and friendly.'
5,'BEST FOR YOUR BUCK!','This is our hotel in NYC whenever we go! It is a great price for a PERFECT locale (walkable to many main attractions including Broadway, Madison Square Garden, Central Park, NYC Public Library, etc.), a beautiful old, historic NYC building with a lot of character, a great concierge, and clean rooms, etc. They are NYC sized, but this is ok!'
4,'Good value for NYC','LOCATION: Hotel\'s location is excelent, with a whole bunch of attractions and facilities within walking distance: Penn Station: 1 block, Madison Square Garden: 1 block, Macys: 2 blocks, Empire State: 2 blocks, Times Square: 5 blocks. Fifth Avenue: four blocks. You can find all imaginable restaurants and stores surrounding the hotel.\r\nSERVICE: Ok, this is New York, so don\'t expect the friendliest and warmest reception. But for city standards, service is fairly efficient. Be aware that it is a huge hotel with more than 900 rooms, so it\'s very possible that you\'ll find yourself making long lines for check-in, check-out or just for asking something. Lobby is always crowded as well as elevators, so be very patient and take your time. If you have a manteinance issue in your room i.e. expect a 1 hour waiting time for someone to come around.\r\nFOOD: There\'s a diner in the hotel premises open 24 hours a day, offering good comfort food at reasonable prices. Otherwise, finding where to eat around the hotel won\'t be a problem at all, trust me.\r\nROOMS: There\'s a wide variety of room sizes and distributions. Most of them are really small and basic, but functional and enough for a good rest after walking around the city. As the whole hotel was redecorated around 1994, furniture is relatively new and rooms are decorated in good taste. Linens and amenities have very good quality for hotel\'s category and size. Again, be aware that almost every room is different in size and distribution, so make sure to contatct the hotel if you are picky or have special requirements, so you get exactly what you want prior your arrival. Otherwise, you\'ll be fine if you are not very claustrophobic. Some of the rooms have great views towards Empire State (try to get one of those!). Now, talking about the shower... there´s an issue! Be prepared for shock therapy!, that´s freezing cold water immediately followed by dangerously scalding one. This could be specialy delicate when staying with small children or older people. I´ve stayed several times in different seasons and different rooms and floors and it has always happened the same.\r\nCOMMON AREAS: There´s a little gym, a souvenir store, the diner andnot much more. But, again, it´s New York, so you´ll be outside the hotel most of the time.\r\nOVERALL: If you get a good rate, which is very possible most of the year, this is a very good deal in a city of expensive hotels and not-so-good service. If you are not very picky, you will find it very convenient in terms of facilities and location. Enjoy NYC!!!'
3,'nice corner room','i stayed at the westin time square dec 18-20 had a nice stay there. \r\nmake sure to get a corner room, they have great views. service was ok. \r\nremember this is not the ritz as far as service goes.'
3,'Great location; Not ideal service','My wife and I recently visited Mahattan for a long early December weekend. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that the hotel was situated in the heart of Times Square. It was a hectic weekend with so many in town to do some early Christams shopping. Because of the crowds, we ended up spending more for our hotel then we generally do on less busy wekends in NYC. The room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable. It was generally quiet. The concierge was helpful in obtaining post theatre reservations, although, a bit sassy. I would recommend it, except that I have had more pleasant experiences and more afforbable experiences at more boutique type places.'
5,'Perfect location; couldn´t ask for more.','Location, location, location, this hotel is right on Times Square, adjacent to a subway station, in the heart of Manhattan. My husband and I stayed there 2 nights with our 8 year old twins, loved the hotel. Staff were friendly and efficient. Room was spotlessly clean, beds were very comfy. High price, yes, but in this case, we got what we paid for. Room service and restaurant prices seemed outrageous, so we picked up breakfast at Starbuck´s or at the McD´s across the street. We all enjoyed having drinks at the revolving restaurant on the top floor - what a view! Loved the glass elevators too.'
2,'Room Could have been better (At least Clean Sheets)','I have to say the location was excellent!! The staff was great we even had a up-grade when they new it was our anniversay. The rooms were small the bathroom were super small I am a petite so I cant imagine a person with an average hight. To tell you the truth it did not bother me that it was small, I was only going to be at the room to sleep. But the worst part was our sheets and pillow cases they were dirty or maybe it was stained, it even had hairs which were not ours cause we just got there. My opinion for room service is as soon as you see those sheets don\'t look clean ...that should go to the trash!!! It needs an up-grade.'
4,'ottimo per posizione','la sua posizione è veramente centrale. A piedi si possono raggiungere tranquillamente: columbus circle, central park, fifth avenue, broadway, time square, rockefeller centr, moma, tiffany, chiesa di saint thomas, lincoln center ecc .Le camere sono pulitissime e molto spaziose. Alla reception abbiamo incontrato personale molto gentile e disponibile, Il ristorante interno all\'hotel è ottimo.'
3,'You get what you pay for......Location spot on!','On first arrival at our hotel we were pleasantly surprised, especially reading the mixed comments that travellers have written about this hotel. We had booked a double room and when we checked in we were upgraded to a king size....however it must have been the smallest king size room/bed in NewYork. The decor was VERY dated, the carpets were dirty in patches and the bed was like sleeping on a hard floor - we had back ache for the whole stay (5 nights)! The beds were clean and the maids were excellent in changing the bed and bringing clean towels - which is what you want as its only to put your head down at night. The only other complaint we had was the Rum House in-house bar, it was VERY dingy and had a bad damp and stale smell to it - not very welcoming, as it states in the brochure and it certainly doesnt look anything like the picture on the hotel brochure at the front desk! We wont be staying here again and wont be recommending it to friends but our stay was still enjoyable as the hotel could not be more central. It is on Times Square and everything is within walking distance so that is the best part of staying at The Edison.'
4,'ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo','hotel in posizione strategica, di fronte alla Penn Station e comunque molto comodo anche per spostamenti a piedi. Stanza grande, comoda, con angolo cottura, salotto, comoda anche per 4 persone. Il prezzo è assolutamente ragionevole per Manhattan. Stanza con aspetto un po\' vecchiotto, ma molto pulita. Da consigliare per una vacanza ed anche per lavoro'
3,'I expect better','Toilets don\'t flush properly, annoying loud speaker and LCD screen in th lift will drive you crazy.'
4,'Crowne Plaza TS average hotel for price paid','Stayed recently with daughter and mother in a double room overlookng TS. Location was great. View was great. Hotel was very clean. Room size was about average. Bathroom was nice size but our water regulator was broke. We couldn\'t get hot water the first night we were there. Called front desk and they sent someone about half an hour later. He said it had to be set at a specific spot and had to run for about 10 minutes to get hot water. Daughter took a cold shower before this and mother had trouble with bath the next morning. Once we learned the trick, we all had hot water. But with the price of the hotel I don\'t think we should have had to learn a trick to get hot water. We were compensated for this though with a free breakfast the morning of check-out. We appreciated the gesture but the breakfast was just mediocre. The best item I had was the Rice Krispies with fresh blueberries and strawberries. If I would have had to pay the $26-32 that was listed as the rice for a breakfast buffett I would have ben upset but since it was free I didn\'t lose out on anything. The waiters don\'t do much serving. I think they only need to give you one cup of coffee and juice. They didn\'t come around to fill up cups after the initial serving. Parking is very expensive so we used an Icon parking garage about 3 blocks down 49th street and saved $90 for the 51 hour stay. At night security checked for room keys before entering the escaltor. Also it was very difficult to get the front desk at night, phone would just ring and ring.'
3,Cold.,'stayed here last week for 6 nights, 3 ladies in a 1 Bedroomed suite.  Bathrooms was very good, bed very comfortable, Sofa Bed too. Clean & tidy. Nice staff. Reception a bit slow at Check In & Out. Porters very nice & efficient. main problem was the cold, after the fi9rst night we had to request extra blankets. After 2 days when it was very cold outside & heating was turned on it was still cold. Great location, but please sort out the heating or we wont be back. will go to one of the other affina Hotels where it is warm'
3,'Just Ok!','Stayed here for a night. The hotel looks nice. The rooms are very spacious. The downsides are the size of the hotel. too many elevators which have access to only certain floors. Its quite a maze to find the elevators that will take you to your specific floor. Be prepared to spend sometime navigating the lobby in search of the elevator. Location is good. Parking even with the discount is expensive. Use a near by garage instead and walk across the street to the hotel. No free internet access (10$/day) and considering the cost for a night you would think that this would come free. We would not like to spend another night here.'
4,'A typical Westin in a big city','I stay at this hotel once or twice every month on a business trip because of its great location near all of my business meetings and of course the Starwood points. Depending on what is going on in NY the prices can be stupid high but not a bad value. The rooms are NOT spacious in any way and I probably have been in 50+ of them. If you are VERY LUCKY and get upgraded to a Jr. Suite then you have some elbow room. The gym is nice but the equipment aging with some broken. The Bar 10 is nice and Dominick is a great bartender. Very friendly. Shula\'s steak house is in the dungeon basement and needs to be closed or redone as it is 9 years old. All in its convenient, sufficient in most ways and I will be back. In fact next week for 4 days.'
4,'Great Location','My husband and I were here for 2 weeks on business (with some leisure too) and loved the location! We flew into EWR and took the train to Penn Station across the street - convenient and easy and only $15 each (one way). \r\nWe used the wireless Internet extensively but were disappointed that we could only have one computer registered for the service. \r\nThe room was generally clean although it appeared that the gap between the fridge and the wall had not been cleaned in some time. Having a fridge and a microwave was great and allowed us to take home restaurant leftovers and keep some snacks in the room. \r\nWe had a small problem with billing that took one phone call and an e-mail follow up to correct, but management responded within minutes of the e-mail and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.\r\nThere was also an incident with a cockroach in our room (maybe the area beside the fridge should be cleaned?!), but it is an old building in NY and after a call to the front desk, housekeeping arrived quickly and removed our extra guest. The hotel also compensated us for the incident which was a nice touch. \r\nThe attached restaurant (Niles) was okay. A 20\% discount on food for hotel guests only applied to dinner, which was not clearly explained. When we inquired about why the discount was not given at breakfast we were told it did not apply to breakfasts. So we had lunch there the next day, and were then told it did not apply to lunches either (which could have easily been communicated after the breakfast question).\r\nThe fitness center was well equipped, however the temperature was like an oven. It was cold in NY when we were there and it seemed like they couldn\'t control the temperatures very well as the hall and our room were intermittently cold and then hot. \r\nThe staff were generally very friendly, the rooms comfortable and a decent size for Manhattan and I would stay there again and recommend it to others despite any of the negatives I mentioned.'
1,'I have never stayed in such a small room','Im not a complainer as you can see by my reviews. I haven\'t even left NYC, but have to write a review in case anyone is considering staying here. If you are in your 20\'s or 30\'s and very thin, this is your place. It is expensive and hip with 4 bars and beautiful public area. But, if you are like me and significantly older and use to comfortable hotels ...go somewhere else. The room could be ..possibly a bit more than 10\' x10\' . The bathroom is so small I have to turn myself sideways to sit on the toilet and not hit the wall with my knees. If I was a large person, I couldn\'t even go into the bathroom let alone take a shower in the tiny shower. I am trying to post pictures of the room and bathroom. Keep in mind they have put mirrors on two walls to help you not feel closed in. The positive is the staff and assistant manager are wonderful. The location is great. If you still decide to stay here make sure you get a room that has been renovated..it at least has a bed that is more than 4off the floor.'
3,'Too hard to get a good night\'s sleep','Detailed pluses and minuses of this hotel are below, but the bottom line is that the paper thin walls and proximity to the L made it impossible for me to sleep well. That drawback was too important for me to rate this beautiful old hotel any higher than average.\r\nPositives: \r\n- Very convenient for business. I had meetings at the federal building on Dearborn and the Palmer House is a short walk from there and other businesses in the Loop. It was also close to shopping on State Street, and was about a 20 minute walk from the Magnificent Mile. I took the blue line train from O\'Hare to the Monroe stop near the hotel, and never needed a cab or other transportation during my four day trip.\r\n- Gorgeous building. The architectural details were amazing.\r\n- Fitness center was very nice, with lots of Precor machines in good condition. (There was a charge if you weren\'t Hhonors silver member or above, though.)\r\n- Service. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful.\r\nNegatives:\r\n-Noise level. I was booked on the executive floor and asked for a quiet room at check-in. The clerk said she would place me on the quiet side away from the train. She must have made a mistake - the noise from the L woke me early every morning and was noticeable throughout the day. To make matters worse, the walls were paper thin. Not only could I hear people talking in normal voices in the rooms next to me, I could understand every word they said as if they were in my room. I won\'t even detail the other late-night noises that made it impossible to sleep.\r\n-Decor. The room was decorated with lots of gold leaf and faded tapestry bedspreads. It goes with the historical nature of the hotel, but just wasn\'t my taste. It made the room seem faded and worn. But that\'s just my personal preference and others may find it charming. The bathroom was very small, but I did like the granite sink and double rainfall showerhead.\r\nSo-so:\r\n-Exec lounge. The lounge for Gold members and above was usually fairly crowded, and the food was very middle-of-the-road (potstickers, stuck-together pasta). I\'ve seen better spreads at other Hilton properties. But, it was still nice to have free coffee and soda all day and the continental breakfast had a lot of choices available.\r\nI\'m returning to Chicago for business soon, but cancelled my next reservation at this hotel. I need to be able to sleep well, especially when traveling for work. If you are a heavy sleeper, there are a lot of positives to staying here, but if noise bothers you I wouldn\'t recommend it.'
5,'Wonderful Xmas birthday','I planned my wifes surprise Xmas birthday party as a family stay in NY and the Hyatt were magnificent in responding to my every wish. All our rooms were upgraded to king sized bedrooms and the facilities provided by the hotel were superb. Breakfast was delightful whilst coffee and snacks from the 24hour market were also a great feature.\r\nCheck in was very quick and extremely friendly in the magnificently adorned grey black lobby in which is so calm and soothing despite sometimes being busy. Complimentary champagne and snacks were sent up by the management for my wife\'s birthday which was a nice surprise. Rooms were very spacious, well designed with plenty of natural light, had lots of storage and magnificently comfortable beds and pillows. Bathroom was bright, new, spacious and had a good shower unit.\r\nThe hotel is in midtown right next to Grand Central and as the name suggests you are just a short walk from all the major attractions 5th Ave, Chrysler, Empire State, GCS, Times Sq, Rockefeller Centre, MOMA and many more plus access to the station means that the whole of NYC is just a short journey away. Wonderful unbeatable location.\r\nEvery service of the hotel was exceptional from the doormen, bellhop, concierge and check in staff to the in room services and facilities and maid service.\r\nA wonderful stay in NYC made better by a top class hotel experience.\r\nMy only gripe would be that I do not expect to pay for wifi these days - especially in the lobby. As GCS was next door though there was plenty of free wifi there so not a major hassle - but why do hotels charge such rates for connection for a day which is equivalent to what I pay per month ?\r\nGo to the Hyatt Park Avenue - you will not be disappointed.'
5,'Excellent choice, excellent value','Palmer House is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, a block from Michigan Ave, close to shopping and business. We arrived early and were offered an upgrade to a room on the executive level, breakfast and cocktail hour included. We took it and enjoyed cocktails in the evening and an excellent breakfast in the morning. There were cookies, snacks, drinks and coffee also available. Everyone at the hotel was cheerful, helpful and attentive; from waiters to concierge and front desk. The hotel is beautiful in an old world style and exactly what we were looking for. We mixed business and a bit of family time for this trip and everyone left happy.'
5,'The Perfect Base','Whilst we only stayed in this hotel for one night on route to Boston, I was sorry we had not also booked it for our four night stay when we returned a week later. A very comfortable hotel ideally placed close to major attractions and great shopping. The Tick Tock Diner served delicious food and was reasonably priced. Staff were helpful and rooms were spotlessly clean with very comfortable beds. The perfect base for a break in NYC.'
3,'Good standard hotel, great location!','L\'hotel in sé non è nulla di eccezionale, ma la posizione è ottima per visitare NY, sia a piedi che con la Subway.\r\nCamere spaziose, letti comodi, il bagno è un po\' piccolo.\r\nPulizia buona, anche se non proprio perfetta... \r\nNoi eravamo al 26° piano e non si sentiva il rumore della strada. \r\nOttima la colazione take-away (non compresa nel prezzo della camera), i camerieri sono molto gentili.'

3,Frustrating.,'I really wanted to like this hotel - it is delightfully bizarre. The staff was at times very helpful; at others, not so much (like when I was trying to change a $100, and the lone front desk clerk didn\'t have access to the cash drawer!). The bars are quirky and fun, though sometimes off-limits due to private parties; but if you do get in, there may not be anywhere to sit. Everything but the room was expensive - the breakfast buffet costs twice what it rightfully should have. The room was about 1/3 the cost of a typical midtown room (via Hotwire) - but 1/4 the size. Internet access just didn\'t work. The heat was unnecessarily on at full blast in the hallways, which meant I had to have the A/C on in the room. Unfortunately, the HVAC unit is smack up against the head of the bed, and it\'s a compressor-based system; when it kicked on periodically during the night, it would jar me awake. \r\nThe hotel cries out for a bit of management to better channel the efforts of the well-intentioned staff. As it stands, I would recommend it only for young people substantially more interested in a good time at a low cost than sleep or comfort.\r\nAt regular prices - like some of those I\'ve seen quoted here (over $300???) - forget it.'
4,'Great place to stay to celebrate daughters 21st birthday!','Great hotel and oustanding location. Center of everything, walking distance to everything, steps to subway. Our only complaint was our room was way too small, but not sure of all rooms.'
4,'Enjoyed the Stay','My daughter and I stayed at this hotel in March (over St Patrick\'s Day!), and once we figured out where the lobby was, we had a very good time. While many prefer to stay at a less touristy place, we chose it specifically for the lights and the location. It is right on Times Square (but not noisy) so getting around, whether by walking, cab or bus, is fairly easy. The rooms are clean, and we paid for a Times Square View, so my daughter could photograph throughout the night. The lobby is not on the ground floor, and there was a staff member directing people to the elevators. We weren\'t fond of the restaurant (could have been just us), but there are so many choices in the area it didn\'t matter. We liked that we were able to walk after dark and still have tourist-type crowds around. The gift shop was nice (important for those last minute what did you bring me...) and although the hotel was expensive, we enjoyed our stay there.'
4,'great location','Location was great! The rooms were cleaned daily, but an ok job was done. They either forgot the soap, or conditioiner or didn\'t vacuum. \r\nDo not buy tickets for bus tours at the hotel. There is no discount and you are directed to the tourline head office to complete the transaction. Do not buy tickets for museums...when get to the museum you still have to stand in line for ticket vouchers. no savings at all.'
4,'Suite mit Balkon bietet Super-Blick auf Empire State Building','Versuchen Sie, eine Eck-Suite im 26. Stock mit Balkon und Blick auf die 34. Strasse mit dem Empire State Building zu bekommen ! Das Zimmer ist mittelgross und geschmackvoll eingerichtet, alles sauber und ok. Das Badezimmer war etwas kleiner und älter, aber ausreichend. Der Service von der Reservierung, dem Empfang und dem Bellman bis hin zum Zimmerservice professionell und freundlich. Die Lage des Hotels ermöglicht, ganz einfach zu Fuss oder vor der Tür mit der Metro unterwegs in Manhattan zu sein. Nebenan ist der Madison Square Garden und die Penn Station, sehr bequem.'
3,'Small, but less than perfectly formed!','Just stayed for 4 nights at the centrally-placed Hudson with friends. Even for NY this hotel\'s rooms were beyond small - and I am just 5 feet tall! Moving around the room was made difficult when my husband was also in occupancy! You could easily wash yourself whilst sitting on the loo-the proximity of basin to toilet was that close. Because of my height my knees, thankfully, didn\'t touch the wall opposite, but in a taller person it would have made using the loo very uncomfortable. Lighting was a joke. It was so dark with the lights ON that I felt like the Hobbit and emerging into daylight was a shock. A simple task like applying make-up was hopeless, trying to use the in-room safe made hard by lack of clear light. I would have sacrificed minimalist cool for a dose of common sense. A hotel can be cool but needs to fulfil guests basic requirements. Our friends\' room had an overflowing loo for the whole time we were there, with flooding to their bathroom floor, despite reporting it to Reception on Days 1, 2 and 3!! Nothing was done and they gave up. For a hotel of this standard, pretty poor. For the room price I would have expected more - why no shower gel, shower cap etc - where were these basic items? When using the hairdryer-(and I have short hair)-half-an-hour later it was still wet. On taking it up with Reception once more, I was told I probably had an \'old\' hairdryer. If I had wanted to spend the whole of my visit drying my hair this would have been fine, but I had gone there to see NY! To their credit the dryer was replaced with a new one, and they also earned brownie points for booking our return flights for us online, and also for the very comfortable bed. The restaurant was undergoing \'refurbishment\' and the temporary one was simply inadequate for an 800+ room hotel - why weren\'t we advised of this when we booked? The public areas were totally occupied by \'outsiders\' visiting The Hudson, presumably for its Phillipe Starck design! Paying guests had very little space in which to sit and relax, and the incessant loud evening music was distinct even on the 8th floor! Luggage storage was efficient and the best part of the entire operation. This is a hotel for people who \'want to be seen\' and not for travellers who want a comfortable well-lit room with a normal sized bathroom,and for the money should be getting just that! I have been to NY many times so am aware of the \'small room\', but not this small!!!!'
5,'POOL POSITION !','Optimale Lage, für alle die New York zu Fuß erobern wollen.\r\nOder via Grand Central Station, die eine Architektonische Meisterleistung ist\r\nund gleich nebenan liegt. Das Hotel ist wirklich ein Traum, nichts mehr von der alten Einrichtung,\r\nnichts mehr vom alten amerikanischen Restaurant Flair, sondern Super Moderne 24h Market-Place Atmosphäre, echt neu gedacht.\r\nDie Zimmer haben auch den neuen Charme bekommen und sind Klasse.\r\nAnsonsten ist das Personal der Hotel-klasse angemessen geschult und freundlich.\r\nUns hat es gefallen !'
5,'A perfect hotel for a NYC visit!','We chose this hotel for its location and were not disappointed. It is an easy walk to the theatres, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Radio City and much more. The hotel itself is quite nice, with large, well-appointed rooms and a friendly, attentive staff. Yes, it\'s pricey, but so is everything else in Times Square. We were very happy with this hotel and thought it was an excellent value.'
5,'Will never stay anywhere else in NYC!','My husband & I traveled to NYC over Memorial Day weekend. This hotel is in the perfect location.....within walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Rockafeller Plaza, the Theater District, etc. The subway is a block away. The service at the Hilton was outstanding. We were greeted as we walked in, and upgraded as we checked in. The new rooms rock! ... Marble shower, comfy beds, flat screen TV, sitting area, updated modern decor.....clean, clean, clean!!! The elevators were plentiful, we did not have to wait in line contrary to other reviews. The timeshare people did not harass you, you just had to tell them you didn\'t have time. Drinks were expensive in the lobby, however this is a hotel bar...they are expensive in all hotels. I don\'t understand where the bad reviews are coming from. My husband is from NYC, and says it was the nicest, cleanest hotel he has ever stayed in NYC. We will not stay anywhere else when we return!'
4,'Busy, Busy, Busy, Excellent','We spent a week here on out US Trip. I was informed it was a busy hotel, and it indeed was. No doubt the busiest Hilton l have stayed at anywhere in the world.\r\nBe that as it may, we were welcomed everywhere from reception to the door staff.\r\nThe rooms were ok, but the position was indeed excellent.\r\nThey say it is quieter on Friday anmd Saturday. Maybe.\r\nI have no complaints whatsoever, and would recommend that you take a drink in the exquisite louge.\r\nYou are in walking distance for nearly everything.\r\nExcellent value.'
5,'Excellent Staff!','We just returned from a lovely stay at the Grand Hyatt. The staff was very, very helpful. The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, and the breakfast bar was so good we never were hungry for lunch.'
5,'Awesome Hotel, Very Plush, The Best Stay Ever','This is a great hotel. It stands up for the Hilton Brand. It can get expensive as things will add up. It is by no means for you if you are on a budget. It has most ammenities that can be found in a hotel and is in a great location.\r\nI stayed here with my wife and two young kids. Parking can be expensive and is located in a parking garage across the street. I had to catch an early morning flight, so I used the business center for a charge to print my itenerary. There was a train station located less than two blocks in which I walked to at 5:00 in the morning with no problems. The last stop was Chicago O\'hare and it took about 45 minutes. The cost was $2.50.\r\nThe beds were very comfortable and the decor was lovely in the room. We did get a fridge with no charge because we have medicine that required refrigeration. That was a small gift at 1am when we checked in. Restuarants are located well within walkind distance as well as public trasportation and taxi\'s were readily available. I would stay here again if I can afford to and need to be in Chicago.'
5,'In the heart of Times Square','This hotel is smack dab in the middle of Times Square. Not next to it, or down the street... but RIGHT in the heart of it. This makes for amazing photos and excellent views. We loved the comfy bed in our hotel and rested very well. Our room was nice and quiet, isolating all noise from the street. The lobby got a bit crowded, but it\'s a huge hotel so that was expected. Overall, an amazing experience in the Big Apple.'
5,'Fabulous Service, Excellent Location!!!!!','I still cant believe this hotel came within our budget for a 4* midtown hotel. Excellent Service, Location above Grand Central Station and across the road from your companies offering airport transfers. Rooms have recently been refurished to a modern standard and are of good size with very comfy beds and a lovely new bathroom. Hotel is beautiful with staff that offer excellent service to their guests. If you turn right and right again when you come out of the hotel you will find a deli/cafe on the left which offers breakfasts, sandwiches and meals to order, eat in or take away to Bryant Park which is five mins up from hotel behind the public library which gives you the view of the empire state building. All your stores are 5mins away and times square is a 10 min stroll. check out the ticket office in times square for your cheap theatre tickets, the later you go the cheaper the tickets will get or look out for flyers for direct sales from the theatre which we found to be 60\% cheaper. Tube station is below the hotel and you can get a ticket for $2.25 each way, we took the tube to watch a Mets Baseball match which was really enjoyable. The hotel offers a business centre where you have use of internet and printers for a small fee. Would definately stay at this hotel and recommend to others.'
4,'Great stay, no problems','I recently spent a week at this Westin with my daughter. I am a Starwood member and used my points for the room. We had a nice room on the 41st floor. Upon entering the hotel, we were cordially welcomed in the lobby. As we would be arriving in the city early, I had called the day prior and requested early check in. We had a short wait in the preferred check in line, but we were checking in when most were checking out. Check in was extremely quick and they had our room ready for us (11 a.m.) I also asked if they had a refrigerator available as my daughter has allergies and it is most helpful to have a refrigerator. She informed me that they would have one sent to our room. I also asked for 4:00 late check-out and this was never a problem. \r\nI found the location to be fine. We were one block from Times Square. Subway entrance was very close. As we were there for a week, this became an easy means of travel once we figured it out (cheaper than the taxis). The staff in the lobby were always very helpful answering questions and assisting us with maps. The hotel is attached to a movie theater which was great for an evening entertainment. The hotel was very clean. \r\nI seldom choose to use the additional costs of internet and phones, so the pricing did not matter. We found free access to the internet in Times Square and I believe the restaurant near the theater had free wifi, although we did not use it. I did have some problems with my cell phone signal in the hotel room.\r\nThis was my second stay in New York City, previously staying at a Sheraton. I found this hotel to have a larger room size. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. No problems, no complaints. I would stay here again, especially on points.'
5,'Wonderful traditional hotel','Palmer is a traditional, classy hotel with a great location and beautiful lobby.'
5,'Location, location, location','first visit to NYC and got a good deal on the Grand Hyatt. Being in the center of NYC and on Manhattan, it was perfect for us. Just perfect. And everybody were friendly, serviceminded and helpful. I would strongly recommend this hotel to everybody that asks. Only thing, (why only 4 stars on rooms) is that the room is rather small - of course you dont spend a lot of time in the room but it fitted the 2 double beds and a desk and that was it. But again, wonderful hotel.'
1,'The worst hotel experience!','We came to NYC during the unfortunate week of 9/13/10 fashion week and had trouble finding lodgings at the discount but clean and basic hotels type (the Pod hotel, for example). And so I booked 3 nights at the Pennsylvania at an exhorbitant price even after reading all the horrible reviews on tripadvisors... \r\n The Pennsylvania hotel turn out to be every bit as horrible as what the reviews said if not more.... The dust and musty smell were so bad that my allergy kicked in the first night (scratchy, swollen throat and drippy nose!!) . A lot of people said that the condition of the hotel does not matter because you are out and about all day and will only need a place to sleep. True, but in this case the place was so bad that you are afraid to go back to your room! \r\nSo I have to say : DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO STAY in this hotel because of the location or because of the price.... It is a filthy place. PERIOD. If you cannot find other lodging option, consider delay your trip or even consider staying outside Manhattan. The subway system can take you anywhere. Skip this hotel or you\'ll be sorry....'
1,'Stay elsewhere!','This hotel was not worth the money at all. The window blinds didn\'t work and so I was exposed to the city lights all night and couldn\'t get a good night\'s sleep. The TV remote also didn\'t work and there were bugs in the bathroom. When I called for service, they forgot about me altogether and I had to call a second time. There is no shortage of hotels in NYC and for the same money you can do much better!'
4,'Excellent hotel, will go again','We are a family of four from England, who stayed for five nights from the 22nd Oct. We were apprehensive about our stay after reading the recent comments. However, we were pleasantly relieved to discover a hotel which we will definately recommend to friends, plus, stay in ourselves on a return visit to New York.\r\nThe staff were extremely polite and helpful ( paying prompt attention to a fault in our safe). Although we didn\'t have a refurbished room, the city views were fantastic and the room itself was spotless. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom always had a plentiful supply of towels and toiletries.\r\nThe location couldn\'t be better, only a few blocks from Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave and plenty of good restaurants to boot. ( I would particularly recommend Jekyll and Hyde,a horror themed reaturant if you have teens) We can\'t wait to go back.'
4,'Luxurious and charming, but crowded','I have stayed at the Palmer House with my husband and adult children four times now. We are usually pleased with the place, but we keep coming back mostly because of my husband\'s Hilton Honors membership. I agree with the other reviewers who complain about the charge for internet service, and the lackluster breakfast in the executive lounge. The main problem we had on our most recent visit was that the breakfast room was so crowded it was difficult to find a table. We took our food back to our room, but not before having to wait in line to get it. In spite of the breakfast problem, though, the rooms we have stayed in were beautifully decorated and comfortable. The hotel is in a perfect location. The housekeepers do an outstanding job and they are very friendly! As is the rest of the staff, who should be commended for making us feel welcome.'
2,'all style, no space ( or light)','Firstly, let me say that there are a lot of good things about this hotel.........the staff are actually very decent,the sky terrace (open until 10) is very impressive,the breakfast is pretty sumptious,the rooms are well thought out for such a tiny space,the ac works a treat,there are vending and ice machines on each floor to save paying minibar( forgive me,mini basket)prices.\r\nHowever,the combination of a lack of room space ( just me in a double room),the extremely low lighting thoughout the hotel,and the general uptightness of a hotel trying to be ubercool made this one of the more claustrophobic travelling experiences ..\r\n.The sad pretentiousness of not putting a name sign in front of the hotel,the trip on the escalator that leads up to the dimly lit lobby ,the rooms that made me think Houdini had it easy; all little things that started to grate until I actually dreaded going back.Only for it was a business trip with others,I would have bolted for a a hotel that would have offered a more relaxed environment.\r\nNext time,I will pay more heed to the rooms warning.When the other reviewers say the rooms are tiny,they are not being overly fussy or narky; it is simply the truth.'
4,'Great Old NYC Hotel','We stayed at the Edison Hotel for 6 nights in NYC. Love the location and the fact that it spans the block, so we could enter from 47th or 46th. Room was as expected, we stripped the old bedspread off which was a big improvement. Our window actually had a VIEW!! and we could see the Hudson from the window at the end of the hall. Great discount for 5+ night stay. Will definitely return.'
5,'A Great Place to Visit','This was my first trip to New York and I definitely was not disappointed!! The Marquis is an absolutely marvelous place to stay. Location, location, location - it\'s right in the heart of the theater district, which is wonderful.\r\nThe staff is most helpful and the accommadations are elegant. Well worth the money!!'
4,'Park Central','The Park Central Hotel is in an outstanding location in midtown Manhattan just a few short blocks from south side of Central Park. Doormen and staff are always pleasant and rooms, although not large, have always been exceptionally clean and comfortable each time I have stayed which is typically a few nights each quarter. Of special note is one of their front desk managers, Elizabeth, who always has a welcoming smile for guests. Elizabeth has helped me out tremendously several times with last minute arrival check-in before I have to run to meetings and with nearby recommendations for dinner. She has a way of adding calm to a storm when you are rushed and has been a gracious host for this out-of-towner.'
1,Dreadful!,'Don\'t even think about it! I checked in and had to check out. It was so bad, I couldn\'t even stay there! The place is filthy, falling apart, and disgusting!'
5,'Hotel SUPER','Nous sommes restés 5 jours à cet hotel et notre expérience a été très bonne ! \r\nLes chambres étaient spacieuses et très propres, les lits étaient confortables. \r\nNous etions au 8e étage avec vue sur une petite rue, la nuit nous n\'entendions aucun bruit de voitures mais au contraire, nous étions en face d\'un pianobar et l\'on pouvait s\'endormir avec une douce musique de piano jazz !!\r\nA notre arrivée, tout s\'est bien passé nous avons eu notre chambre tout de suite (bien que venues avec 2H d\'avance).\r\nLe jour du départ, il faut liberer la chambre avant midi mais il y a possibilité de faire garder les valises pour 0.50$ par bagage jusqu\'a minuit (très pratique!)\r\nLa localisation de l\'hotel est FANTASTIQUE ! On est au coeur de la ville, parfaitement situé pour commencer de longues ballades a pied ou meme pour prendre le métro (toutes les lignes sont à proximité).\r\nNous reviendrons !!!!'
5,'Perfect Location','My family stayed at the Grand Hyatt from Nov. 16-19, 2007. This was our third time at this hotel. The location is perfect. You are in the middle of it all and connected to Grand Central Terminal. You don\'t have to go outside to get to a subway station, so if the weather is not perfect, you don\'t have to deal with it until your destination. The room was great, although the bathroom is rather small. But for a few days, you can deal with it. Love the Regency CLub for breakfast and dessert in the evening. We will definitely be staying here during future visits.'
1,'Fed Up','Stayed once before at Edison Hotel back in Dec. 1998. At $100 a night, it was a great deal. Basic hotel, large room by NY standards. Took half an hour for hot water and almost as long for elevator. But great location and great price. \r\nJust got back from a 4 night stay there. What a nightmare. Room was now $284 (this is before tax/fees). Room was run down--wallpaper torn, stained carpeting, etc. You get the picture. Booked a suite because it was either that or one double, and the suite was actually smaller than the queen room we had in 1998. Everyone there except for the guy that checks your room key before entering the elevator (and actually doesn\'t always check it so I didn\'t feel all that safe) was surly and obnoxious. Barely any water pressure in sink; only ok in shower. Bathroom was so small, I barely fit into it. Charged us 50 cents for bucket of ice--really I just paid over $300 a night for a room (yes, I know, it\'s NY) but come on--charging for ice? The Edison Deli doesn\'t take credit card--ok, maybe that keeps prices down but still--who wants to walk around NYC with a bunch of cash?\r\nOK, I said, it\'s still a great location for theater, and we eventually saw three wonderful shows. However, the night before we were to check out, I asked if they had express checkout via TV. Nope (hello, what century are you living in?). But it was suggested to me by the concierge (actually they were pretty good-at least they were pleasant) to check at the front desk to see if we could work something out. Good thing we did. Long story short, I had originally booked 5 nights online. Decided a couple of days later to change it to 4 nights and come in a day later. I called to change it but was told to do so online which I did. I received a confirmation e-mail from the Edison with the change. When I checked in, the surly front desk agent asked if we were checking out on the 23rd or 22nd. I thought that was strange so I told him the 23rd. And our room was ready even though it was probably around noon when we checked in. \r\nApparently the front desk doesn\'t \'talk\' to their online reservations because they thought we were checking in on the 18th (not the 19th) and staying 5 nights. At 1 a.m. on the 19th, they checked us in because the hotel was full, and they wanted to make sure we got a room (that\'s what they eventually told us). However, here\'s what I heard from Sean from the Front Desk at various times when we discovered the problem of them charging us for 5 nights instead of 4: \r\n- We checked in earlier than 3pm so that\'s why we had to pay for an extra night\'s room\r\n- We checked in at 1 a.m. and that\'s why we had to pay for an extra night\'s room\r\n- We checked in on the 18th (even though I had a confirmation e-mail from them, showing the 19th as well as my boarding pass from Continental)\r\nThen he had an assistant manager, Margaret Sowa, talk to us. What a snotty, obnoxious person. I won\'t go into detail, but this was a very unpleasant person. When I finally got her to understand that the hotel had made a mistake and charged us for one extra night, she said she would \'comp\' us a night on the bill, like she was doing us some huge favor by billing us for the correct amount! She never once apologized, never offered anything as compensation for all of our time and trouble in trying to fix their mistake.\r\nI asked for her card and something in writing to make sure that this would be taken care of and I wouldn\'t have to explain this yet again to another person when either checking out or from home when I received my credit card statement. She seemed very put out about this but eventually provided the necessary information. I was afraid that, after we returned from the theater that night, our room key wouldn\'t work and that they had carted all of our stuff away--that\'s how unprofessional and nasty this woman was.\r\nI called my credit card company when I returned home and found that they had a put a hold on the incorrect amount back when we checked in on the 19th. Found out today that it had been fixed, so I\'ll give them a little bit of credit since I really thought I would have to dispute the charge with my credit card company, etc.\r\nLong and the short of it--pay a little bit more and stay at the Marriott Marquis (my friends have had luck there) or the W--they are both very close to the Edison so you are in the midst of Times Square and Theater District if that\'s your main focus for your trip. But avoid the Edison. They desperately need to have some classes there for their employees about saying please, thank you, you\'re welcome and sorry. The only really pleasant person we interacted with was housekeeping on the last day as she wished us a safe journey and thanked us as we left our room. No one at the Front Desk ever did.'
5,'Wonderfully Wired Westin','If you\'re in a rush - we recommend the Westin T. Sq. - no questions, no worries, book it, go, enjoy!\r\nIf you\'re not, we recommend it for these reasons;\r\nObviously the location of the Westin would come slap bang at the top of the list of +ve\'s for any tourist. Yeah NY is pretty spread out but this is the buzz of the city no matter who you are! Everything’s lights and glitz and some things are 24-hour, particularly the Starbucks under the hotel and the Ben & Jerrys across the road. \r\nThis hotel however still manages to be a relaxing retreat from the buzz, even if ambient noise does creep in from time to time (although, what the f*** is ambient noise in NY? NY IS noise! And what tourist isn\'t gonna hear a fire truck siren for the first time and trip over the bed on the way to the window?!)\r\nAnyway, to recap the hotel has an excellent location, that\'s a given for any Times Square hotel. But the advantage of this hotel is that it would be a very nice hotel to stay in no matter where it was placed! The staff are very helpful and \'happy-to-help\' - doormen, concierge, bell boys, room service - all very nice.\r\nThe standard rooms are spacious enough to feel some comfort of home (and a little bit more once you get in the bed!). Ahh, the bed! The \'Heavenly\' bed as it\'s called will not leaving you reading the trade descriptions act. It is, in the words of my significant other \'like a marshmallow\'. It is a very comfortable and very nice to sleep in after a day of pounding the streets, seeing the sights and racking up an enormous credit card bill!\r\nNext on the list of good-hotel points are the in-room movies, especially for us Brits. You can order loads of new releases (most aren\'t even out over here!) at the fair sum of $10.99. EG Feb 6th there was Aeon Flux, Chicken Little, Walk The Line, Flightplan, The Family Stone, etc.. Any classic console buffs? There\'s a bevy of classic Nintendo games to order too!\r\nNext up is the bathroom, it was well up to expected 5* standards and I would recommend a combo of high speed on slow speed on the multi heads. My only complaint would be the rather shallow bath, but whatever; I don\'t like baths anyway!\r\nViews are an added bonus in this hotel (see pictures). Ours was of the East River, and I\'ve seen pictures of even better views - request high floors.\r\nOther smaller things that just made it that little bit better were things like the robes, the safe, USA Today to-your-door, good TV (any CSI fans out there want year-in-advance showings? Get flicking! There\'s ABC, MTV, CNN, HBO, BBC America...), calling for (free) extra stuff (travel plugs, scales, fridge, robes, etc..) and the in-room Starbucks, iron and hair dryer. (P.S. UK ladies; your GHD\'s will NOT work properly without the correct adapters so either bring adapters or leave them and buy an excellent pair for $30 from Duane Reade round the corner.\r\nThe hotel also has a gym, spa and convenience store for your pleasure. So enjoy.\r\nSo, advantages;\r\n Location\r\n The Bed!\r\n The staff\r\n Room extra\'s (films etc)\r\n Nice bathroom\r\n Views\r\n Reasonable price\r\n Quality TV\r\nDisadvantages;\r\n Wow, jeez let me think..maybe I didn\'t like..erm - coming home??\r\nTips;\r\n Tourists - you think your two massive cases are enough for your souvenirs? They\'re not!\r\n Tourists - before you buy at Bloomingdales, go to the Visitor Centre on the 1st floor for 11\% off most things.\r\n Tourists - bring LOTS of cash! LOTS. You still won\'t have enough.\r\n Brits - the strawberries & cream frappucino is a lot better in the US!\r\n Tourists - the Trump Wollman rink in Central Park closes at 2.30 on a Monday & Tuesday.\r\n Tourists - some Broadway shows don\'t play on a Monday or Tuesday.\r\n Tourists - a taxi from JFK to Manhattan is only $45 + about $4 toll - roughly the same back! Don\'t buy a transfer from the UK. \r\nAnyway, enjoy it and don\'t blame me if you have a crap time because all this good stuff was a one-off for us :/'
4,'Good Hotel for Daughter\'s 1st NY Trip','Yes, the Hotel Edison is an older hotel, yet its very NY charming. They had the lobby very cheerfully decorated for the Holidays. First, let me say that I\'m not an employee of the Edison or any partner - I\'m Las Vegas based.\r\nIf you want a base for your NY trip, it’s a very good choice - we were just there from 12/7-12-10/2012 and could get everywhere we planned very easily. Our room was on the 12th floor - the rooms were clean & spacious. We asked for more covers the 1st night & they brought them & when they cleaned the room they added the extra blankets. The water temp was regular, good towels & noise was not an issue. All staff was kind & courteous to us. The cafe downstairs in the lobby had good, hot, fast breakfast.\r\nI would give the hotel 5/stars - yet, the only issue we had was check-in was beyond the 3pm time (believe they had huge traveling parties checking out), issues with arriving at the room & there was room construction still going on. Renaldo at the front desk was very helpful & upgraded our room & upon check-out another gentleman was helpful also! Yes, I would stay at Hotel Edison again.'
3,'Great location, but we may not return','The Westin is in a great location for proximity to Times Square, subway stops, and many Manhattan locations are within walking distance. Unfortunately having said that the hotel fell short in many respects for us. First of all, our reservation requested no down pillows and comforters, which were in the room on arrival. When we asked that they be removed the maid pulled the comforter, and left the bed in shambles. The rest of the room was only partially cleaned, that day leaving us without coffee, towels, or the bed pillows requested to replace the down. Next was a leaking, dripping shower head that also squirted water to the side when turned on. It took two days of daily requests to get this repaired. The staff that we had contact with were all pleasant and professional, but it seemed that their communication between departments was lacking. \r\n We used Starwood points for our stay at the Westin, and couldn\'t help but wonder if that had something to do with the service we received. Westin is usually one of our hotel choices, but this may be one will will avoid in the future.'
4,'lussuoso ma cn qlke pecca','sn stata in qsto albergo x 6 giorni e dv dire ke wwwwoooowwww toglie il fiato ma ha delle pecche ke a mio giudizio x il suo segmento sn davvero gravi: noi eravamo al 31°piano e le pareti del corridoi nn erano messe un granke nel senso ke c\'erano dei rigofiamenti nn indifferenti anzi disturbano molto la vista ... x nn parlare poi di un altro piccolo intoppo al check in - siamo arrivati alle 9 del mattino e alla reception c dicono ke nn possiamo avere una camera prima delle 2 le 3 del pom ma dopo diverse insistenze sn riuscita ad averla intorno alle 11 e 30 altra nota dolente insomma x un albego di qst categoria qst piccolezze nn vanno x nulla bene ma x il resto nn ho nulla da lamentare il servizio è eccellente e la location toglie il fiato .... ed anke la gente ke lo frequenta una chiccheria unica ...'
3,'Bom hotel, sem Bed Bugs, mas falta conforto / Good hotel, no Bed Bugs, but lack comfort','Portugues: \r\nMe assustei quando vi a maioria das qualificações do Edison como apenas Bom, mas é essa a real nota deste hotel. Porque ele, para turistas, tem uma das melhores localizações da cidade, há cerca de 20 metros a pé do Times Square, assim como é muito próximo as estações de metrô, farmácias e demais comodidades, os quartos são limpos diariamente, e sem os temidos Bed Bugs (pelo menos no meu quarto, mas não vi nenhum comentário sobre eles no site). Em contrapartida, por ser um hotel gigantesco, existem falhas que dificilmente são corrigidas, como o mobiliário que é todo velho (apenas as TVs são de LCD), as camas as vezes tem buracos, o pessoal da recepção não é nada educado e a internet é opcional e muito cara. No geral, existem opções melhores, com internet gratuita e mobiliário mais novo, mas acredito que seja uma boa opção caso consiga alguma promoção.\r\nEnglish:\r\nI got scared when I saw most of Edison\'s qualifications as just Good, but this is the real note of this hotel. Because he, for tourists, has one of the best locations in town, there are about 20 meters walk from Times Square, as it is very close to subway stations, pharmacies and other facilities, the rooms are cleaned daily, and without the dreaded Bed Bugs (at least in my bedroom, but have not seen any comments about them on the site). In return for being a gigantic hotel, there are flaws that are hardly addressed, as is all the furniture that old (only TVs are LCD), the beds sometimes have holes, the front desk staff is nothing polite and the internet is optional and very expensive. Overall, there are better options, free internet and more new furniture, but I believe it is a good option if you get a promotion.'
5,'Wonderful Place to Stay','We arrived early around 11:30 on the 23rd of December and was able to check into our room at that time, which was fabulous. The front desk clerk was awesome and very accommodating. The room was very clean a bit warm but we were able to open the window. The location was excellent and within walking distance to everywhere we needed to go. My experience was exceptional and I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.'
1,'Where\'s the heat?','We thought with the great location that we were on to a average priced hotel across form the Garden. Apparently all their time is spent cleaning the lobby with no attention to any other facets of the property.\r\nFor starters we were placed in a room with no heat (in Feb). When I called the front desk they sadi they knew there was no working heat in that block of the hotel. I then asked why we were placed in a room that they knew there was no heat... 45 minutes later we were brought a new key for a new and equally dirty and ill equipped room. So when I went to take a shower there was no hot water. That was the end of the line and we cancelled our room and left.\r\nThis hotel is for tour groups and people who don;t mind dirty carpets, small beds, crappy linens, outdated heating and cooling and the list goes on. For $159 per night you can do a lot better!'
3,'In Ordnung','Das Hotel hat eine sehr gute Lage. Direkt bei der Penn Station / Madison Square Garden. Macys ist nur eine Strasse weiter - ideal für Shopping Junkies ;-)\r\nDie Zimmer haben eine ordentlich Größe, war bei uns aber sehr dunkel. Es scheint ein schon etwas älteres Hotel zu sein. Dusche und Klo sind schon sehr abgenutzt und es wurde auch nicht sauber geputzt. Wir haben nur mit Badeschlappen geduscht und das Klo mit Anti-Bakteriellem Mittel abgesprüht. Bett- und Frottewäsche wurden täglich frisch gemacht.\r\nFür New Yorker verhältnisse in dieser Preisklasse durchwegs zu empfehlen. Man kann sehr schlechter Übernachten.'
4,'Excelente localização','Muito bom hotel, localizaçaão perfeita. Pena q os quartos são muito pequenos.'
4,'Good Location','I have just arrived back from a 5 night stay in the New Yorker Hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent. As other reviewers have stated, its about a two minute walk from Macys and other central attrations, MSG and the ESB. \r\nThe hotel is basic enough, but extremely busy. People are constantly coming and going, whether it be early morning or late at night, the hotel never sleeps! \r\nThe rooms are basic enough, but clean. \r\nThe location is by far the main selling point for this hotel.'
5,'Great Location!','Is there a better location than Grand Central NYC? No!\r\nHotel lobby was impressive and room was huge. Bed was super comfy (great for jet lag).\r\nReally enjoyed my stay here!'
5,'fabulous hotel','I have stayed in the New yorker three times, having travelled from Ireland on pre christmas holidays. I honestly could not fault the hotel. The location is great right across from Masdison Square garden and not far from Macy\'s. The Room we had on the three occasions was a room with two double beds and the rooms are huge. The beds were so comfie, slept great in them and the room and bathroom was spotless. Had a lovely view of the Empire State Building on my last visit. The staff are polite and helpful and nothing is too much trouble. In the future i will stay in this hotel should i return to new york the hotel is fabulous'
1,'Creepy! Location only worth it if you\'re lucky to get a good room','I made my trip arrangements trough a travel agent and had no choice concerning the hotel, since it was a great deal and prices were really a bargain.\r\nAfter reading the reviews, we were terrified and almost decided to cancel the reservations and get another hotel, even if we had to pay for high fees for that. But then we decided to relax and give it a try, if it was that terrible we would simply walk away and find another place to stay.\r\nWe arrived around 1pm and there were only 3 guests waiting in the line for check in. I thought we had a great beginning since all reviews told about the huge lines. But when I walked up to the rude attendant, he yelled at me saying he had no rooms available for an early check-in. I tryed to explain that we didn\'t want an early check-in, we just wanted to do all the check-in procedures and leave our luggage while we waited and had a meal somewhere in the nearby. Impossible to communicate with the old schmuck, we gave up and decided to wait until the check-in time.\r\nWhen we got back to the lobby at around 3 pm, the line was huge! After waiting more than 1 hour, when it was my turn, I told the attendant (this time was a nice one) I wanted a refurbished room. He told me he would see what he had to offer us and I emphasized that it had to be either a refurbished room or a spacious room, since we requested a TPL. He was really nice and told me he had a good room for us and despite not being a renovated room, he was sure we would like it. And he also told us we could come back and talk to him if we were not satisfied with the room.\r\nWhile we were walking down the hall (on 2nd floor) we were really scared: it\'s the creepiest place I\'ve ever been to, the smell of mold was disgusting and the carpet and walls looked really shabby. But when we got to our room, I can tell you: it wasn\'t bad at all. It was a huge room, with two double beds, plenty of place, walk-in closet with iron and ironboard, and the bathroom was one of the renovated ones. We were really relieved, the room was perfect for what we needed and also clean (no smell of mold). A/C was working properly, beds were ok, water pressure and temperature fine, everything was just fine.\r\nSo, I wrote this huge review just to tell you the following:\r\n1. The hotel is creepy, old and service is terrible. BUT, you might be lucky if you ask for a good room in the front desk by the check-in time. Don\'t forget to be polite, you get what you give;\r\n2. Location is great, can\'t beat for this price in Manhattan;\r\n3. Don\'t expect anything you are used to have in standard hotels, it will certainly be worse in the Penn. But remember that in Manhattan, the Penn\'s really a cheap place, so you will get cheap service and a cheap hotel.'
4,'Good mid-range hotel, perfect Midtown location, terrific value','We booked on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The location next to Penn Station, on the A, C and E subway lines is perfect for getting around Manhattan. Macy\'s is a block away and Times Square is walkable in 10-15 minutes. The rooms are recently renovated and quite spacious. The bathroom didn\'t have much space for putting things down, the shower temperature never stayed still (although there was always hot water) and the towels were very small! All was very clean though. No coffee maker or fridge in the room, but there was a drugstore across the street and a breakfast coffee kiosk in the lobby.\r\nOverall, and we had the feeling of staying in a stylish, individual hotel with every convenience, but for terrific value for money (booked through Hotels.com). Definitely going to stay here again next time we\'re in Manhattan!'
5,'Fantastic Stay','A perfectly located hotel for Times Square and all of the New York attractions, room was clean and comfortable, staff efficient and welcoming, all in all a great stay. Only fault is we would have liked to stay longer!'
4,'Hotel Pennsylvania New York','Hotel Pennsylvania está mutio bem localizado em New York. Fica em frente ao Madison Guarden, do lado da loja da Macys, Mahatam Mall, Victoria Secret.\r\nPerto da Times Square e Central Parque.\r\nDá pra andar a pé pra tudo quanto é canto.\r\nSó achei a iluminação do quarto escura, pois é feita através de abajurs.'
3,'Tiny rooms, great location','Rooms are tiny, but location is fantastic. A couple of minutes walk to Time Warner Centre & Central Park. Skip dinner at the hotel and try the great Sushi a couple of doors down from hotel.'
4,'Ottimo Hotel','Il Grand Hyatt mi ha piacevolmente stupito! Un albergo imponente, situato al centro di Manhattan e ben collegato alla metro (comodissimo l\'accesso diretto alla Grand Central Station). Abbiamo preso una matrimoniale standard ed era una camera molto accogliente, arredata in stile moderno, silenziosa e dotata di tutti i comfort (carini gli interruttori per le luci a sfioramento). Il bagno era pulito e con una doccia spaziosa, sempre il tutto in stile moderno.\r\nIl personale delle pulizie passava anche più volte al giorno.\r\nVolevo inoltre sottolineare che al nostro arrivo all\'aereoporto abbiamo avuto un problema poichè non ci sono arrivati i bagagli. Il personale dell\'Hyatt è stato molto cordiale e disponibile ad ascoltare il nostro problema ed insieme con il personale dell\'aereoporto JFK lo ha gestito in maniera impeccabile.'
2,'poor customer service','My husband and I had booked a night away in nyc to celebrate our anniversary. We had booked a corner room with a king size bed well in advance. When we arrived we were not told they had given our room away and had not adjusted the price. We discovered this when we opened the door to our small room with a twin bed. Not a good start to our romantic night away. When we asked to speak to someone we had to wait an hour and a half for someone who wasnt even the manager to call us back, just to get a 30.00 credit. I would not frequent this hotel again. There was no willingness to help on managements part or even an apology about the fact that they could not hold the room we booked.'
5,'So helpful words wont do them justice!','The team here at Affinia Manhattan have been so helpful during and after Hurrican Irene. They have gone out of their way to help us through with all the issues that got thrown their way.\r\nThe location is excellant with Time Square just a 10 minute walk away and subway points round the corner. The food in the bar and restaurant is really good and priced well for NYC. Lots of other bars or restaurants to eat in which are also round the corner. Couldn\'t fault the place.'
5,'Lost and Found','My daughter, husband and I were deeply impressed with the excellent customer service rendered by the staff of Hotel Edison during our stay from 19 to 20 July 2012. \r\nOur fabulous encounter was on 21 July 2012 morning at about 9.00 am, after our 2-day stay in Hotel Edison. My husband and I were hastily boarding a shuttle bus arranged by the hotel staff to ferry us from the hotel to New York City, JFK airport for Singapore. We were shocked to find that the camera was not with us after we had checked-in to the airport for departure. Immediately, I contacted the security supervisor, Mr. Ismael Reyes of Hotel Edison. The helpful man courteously told me that he had found the camera at the hotel lobby and was keeping it. Immediately, my husband and I hired a taxi from the airport to the hotel to collect our camera from him. \r\nThe camera belonged to our daughter. She had left the hotel six hours before us on the same morning. Hundreds of photographs taken by her during our tour in U.S were stored in the camera. We were delighted it was found by your security staff and honestly returned it to us; otherwise we would have no means to compensate her.\r\nMay our sincere gratitude be relayed to the security personnel of Hotel Edison spearheaded by Mr Ismael Reyes, for their vigilant against security,honesty and excellent customer service rendered to us. Hotel Edison would definitely our first choice when we next visit New York City. \r\nJessie Chng\r\nTourist from Singapore'
3,'Great for x-gen not for baby-boomers','booked one night through Priceline at $250 and later learned I probably could have got it cheaper. \r\nPluses are: clean, modern rooms and great location in mid-town. Price\r\nis good if you book on Hotwire or Priceline. Also the nightlife in the bars and lobby is very active (this is also a minus)\r\nNegatives are: very tiny rooms, a bathroom that is smaller than most\r\nRV bathrooms, very dark hallways, lobby area is dark and has constant\r\nmusic blaring, elevators have the same music blaring. My wife and I (both in our early sixties) arrived on a Friday night around 8. The lobby and bars were packed with nice-looking ladies and men in their 30\'s and the music was loud. If you want a place with that - this is the place for you. You\'ll probably have a great time checking out the\r\neye-candy. If you\'re like my wife and I, this probably isn\'t the atmosphere you\'ll enjoy. I\'m sure the hotel did not decorate and market their bars and lobby for sixty-year olds so I have no problem and no complaint - just be aware.\r\nI would stay again just because of the location and low price. If I can get a room for under $200, and I know the room will be clean, I would go there again knowing the room would be very small, the music would be loud, the hallways would be dark but it would be VERY convenient to mid-town.'
4,'Wonderful historic hotel','We enjoy staying at the Palmer because it is historical and the facility has been restored beautifully. Make sure to check out the ballrooms. The Lockwood restaurant is excellent and the service is the best. It has a very friendly hotel staff. The typical room is a little on the small side as most older hotel rooms are. We always recommend this hotel for out of town guest because of it\'s historical significance and proximity to the museums and M. Park.'
4,'Fantastic location','We are just back from a five night stay at the Edison.After reading the reviews we were a bit nervous about staying there. Well we had nothing to worry about. The room was great.The bathroom was in need of a little attention ( re-grouting ) but everything else was fine. A super hot shower, clean towels every day and a powerful hairdryer.\r\nThe location is fantastic - so close to times square.We were on the seventeenth floor and were at the back of the hotel so heard no noise. There was no view from our window but who goes to New York to spend time looking out of the hotel window.\r\nJust go out of the back door of the hotel and cross the road and you can get great half price theatre tickets. You maybe have to spend and hour in the queue but its well worth it. We got fantastic seats for the shows six rows from the front . \r\nThe foyer is beautiful, the furniture could do with re-covering but it adds to the art deco charm.\r\nOverall our stay was fantastic and I would definitly stay at the Edison again!'
4,'Nice Clean Place near Madison Square Garden','Nice location near Madison Square Garden and short walk to Macy\'s and Times Square or catch the subway across the street. Staff is very helpful and friendly. We were traveling with 3 other families and our room was the smallest...the bellman said when they remodeled they basically cut each room in half. Still, for Manhattan it was adequate and who spends a lot of time in their room in NYC. Our room was on the street side and noise could be an issue if you let it. Our heat didn\'t work but the staff took care of it quickly when informed. Nice restaurant. I would definantly stay here again.'
5,'Great Place to Stay','This was my first time in NYC and was not sure on which hotel to stay at. I am glad I chose this one. Hotel is located about 3 blocks from Central Park, Right next to the subway out the back door, very close to 5th Ave for shopping and Time Square is close enough to walk to.\r\nRooms were your basic and housekeeping had are room cleaned by 11:00 every day.\r\nStaff were all very friendly and helpful. We got into NYC around 12:00 and we were able to check in and get a room early.\r\nI recommend staying here and would stay again.'
3,'Don\'t judge a book by its cover.','If the hotel was rated simply on its lobby, it would receive 6 out of 5 stars. However, there is more to a hotel than its lobby. The lobby is an art deco masterpiece. Soaring painted ceilings, stunning light fixtures, fantastic ambiance. I could spend all day soaking in the beauty and elegance of the lobby. Which is what I should have done. The rooms are old, yes. But that gives them their own charm. You can picture what it must have been like to stay in the hotel in the 1thes. That wasn\'t the problem with our room. Apparently, no one had stayed in our room in months because there was a visible layer of dust on everything. Even our bed linens and pillows had to be fluffed to remove the dust. That was disappointing and a little gross.\r\nThe service was not an issue because we didn\'t receive any. We checked in in the evening and then out again the next late morning so we didn\'t have any interraction with anyone aside from the front desk.\r\nMy suggestion, go for a drink or just sit and read a book in the lobby but find somewhere else to sleep for the night.'
1,'Worst hotel I ever stayed in.','We stayed here on our honeymoon. We were traveling for two months and stayed here as our last location. We had booked through Trailfinders. We were expecting small as its newyork. I have been to newyork twice before but this was the smallest room ever. This was ok but there was an airconditioning duct outside the window blowing at full blast.\r\n I went to reception to complain and request a new room but the attitude of the staff was horrendous. They actually offered me earplugs! We could believe they were letting this room with the noise\r\nI then spoke to the manager who actually had the neck to say he had stayed there on a double shift and could sleep ok. I dont think he would have paid full price though. They said the hotel was fully booked (on a wednesday) and that there sister hotel were also booked out. The moved us to a suite the next day suite meaning slightly bigger room with an office desk wedged against the wall. \r\nHoweve the staff attitude completely ruined our experience so we moved out the next day despite having already paid in full. Then to add insult to injury they double charged me for a bottle of water on my credit card after I paid cash.'
4,'Second stay at Hilton New York and again very good!','This is the second time we stayed in the Hilton New York. The first time was in May this year and now in December (Dec 19th – Dec 27th). \r\nThe arrival in the hotel was good. Because of our VIP Gold HHonors membership we were allowed to check in at the special desk for diamond and gold members. After check-in we got up to our room and I was a little bit disappointed of the room. It was very small; smaller than the room we had in May. This room wasn’t renovated, which it wasn’t a big problem because it looked all so clean. There was also no in-room safe. We were staying for 8 nights and there for we went back to this front desk. We asked for a change of room if this was possible. Well, she looked into her computer and finally gave us a renovated room. She was so friendly and she changed the room without any fuss. For a few minutes we talked about our country, because she visited The Netherlands in the past. \r\nLet\'s talk about the room:\r\nRoom was spacious and refurbished. The bed was comfortable with white linens. What I liked the most was the lighting. You were able to make the room cozy, just like home. There was a sofa, desk with a chair and a flat screen TV. The shower doesn’t have shower curtains, but a door of glass, which makes the shower more spacious and comfortable. The bathroom had a hair dryer and toiletries, like shampoo, conditioner, soap, mouthwash, and lotion. The bathroom has a large shower, but not a tub. I didn’t mind that at all, because I prefer a shower instead of a tub.\r\nI have one major fault to the room; It was very warm throughout the night. Only the heater is working during the winter months, so no air-conditioning. We opened the window very often to cool down the room. \r\nWe ate breakfast (complimentary) in the New York Marketplace at the hotel. For a few days it’s OK, but not for a whole week and more. Every day the same food, no change at all, was something I didn’t like. There was always a long line for breakfast. This wasn’t the case in May. If you only want a cup of coffee, Starbucks is attached to the hotel. \r\nLocation:\r\nFinally let’s talk about the location. The location of the Hilton can\'t be beat! Wonderful location in the middle of tourist attractions like 5th avenue, MoMA, Times Square, Central Park, and Rockefeller Center. \r\nOverall:\r\nWell, we experienced this hotel during the summer and the winter and we had both times a wonderful stay. It’s clean, it’s spacious, the rooms are very nice and as a HHonors member you have some privileges. \r\nI would definitely stay here again!'
3,'Not Worth It','Don\'t get me wrong... the Palmer House is a VERY gorgeous hotel with a neat history. It\'s definitely worth coming inside for a look. But not a stay. We\'re paying about $220 a night (a regular room, no fancy executive suite or anything). There is no free breakfast (a bagel alone costs $4). There is no free wifi, unless you\'re an HHonors member. You CAN go downstairs to the Starbucks for free wifi. There is no coffee maker or mini fridge in our room. Plus, the vending machine selection is... not impressive. I hope you like Coke or Dasani. And it\'s FREEZING; they abuse the air conditioners here. I wish I\'d brought a jacket. I did not try the spa or breakfast, so I just gave them an average rating - they may be very good for all I know.\r\nThe pool and jacuzzi are very small and average - not what I would expect with a Hilton hotel. When we first went to the jacuzzi it was COLD. We told two employees in the lobby about it, but they just said they would let someone know and didn\'t give us any information on if or when it would be fixed. We asked again later and they finally made a simple phone call to find out (why couldn\'t they do this the first time?) and the reason it was cold is they had emptied it to clean and then refilled it, but the water was taking longer to heat up than they thought. Well... at least they clean their jacuzzi, I was happy about that, but I\'m not sure why they had to do it in the middle of the day. We were not the only ones who complained.\r\nThe rooms are nice, but very average (at least the beds are comfy). As long as you don\'t mind the hustle and bustle of downtown, the location is nice; it\'s near a lot of stores and restaurants.The only things really worth seeing are the lobby and the ballrooms. So unless you\'re loaded and love blowing your money and feeling fancy/important, I suggest you get a better deal by staying somewhere else (like the Hampton Inn that is a way better value literally right next door) and just stop by the Palmer House for a look.'
3,'Great Service, Hotel Can Use Some Updates','The room I was in was a nice size. Very difficult to navigate the numbering system to the floors but as a compromise there are pictures of very famous entertainers all along the hallyways so you can remember turn right at Nat King Cole.. or something similar. The room I was in had been upgraded at some point because it had granite in the bathroom and a newer bowl shaped sink. But the age of the hotel still shows through in the tiling in the bathroom. Also I had wallpaper peeling in my room and the part of the showerhead that attaches to the wall was hanging off. Not appreciated for this level of hotel and the rates it commands.\r\nI didn\'t have a view, just some part of the rooftop. Kept the curtains drawn. However I did not have a view of the train tracks, which I heard several complaints about. The tracks are very close to the hotel. This is not the hotel\'s fault but if you are on that side of the hotel it may disturb you. Seems they run more frequently during the day but it\'s something worth checking out. For sure if you are on that side of the hotel request a high floor so you are not literally next to the train. \r\nThere is no shelf space in the bathroom if that is important to you. The sink takes up most of the counter and there is no additional shelving. There is a small glass shelf about the size of a couple of postcards on the wall but that was very loose and unstable in the room I was in. The bathroom door would not remain open so I propped it open with an ottoman and put a towel on top of that and used it for additional space to lay items.\r\nIn room dining was fast and very nice; usual hotel pricing. About $22 for a full breakfast of meat, potatoes, eggs, juice, tea and toast, including tax and mandatory service charge.\r\nI found the service to always be top notch.'
5,'Great Location & Friendly Staff','Rooms are nice & functional. In the Bathroom I received the traditional Westin Amenities, which I really love! The heavenly bed was outstanding.\r\nMost of all: The staff was very attentive and friendly!'
5,'Great hub for activities','Just like many prior reviews stated, it is a modern hotel in a terrific location. We had the AAA with breakfast promotion and thus made for a great deal. The room was in a corner on a higher floor.'
2,'Room from the 90s.','Booked on a bidding site for a reasonable rate - 107/night plus tax, called in advance to request a King or Queen bed and was told that they could not guarantee it, but when we arrived (6:30 PM on a Friday) we were told the only room available was a double. Called reception (after trying to get through for 20 minutes they finally answered) and was told this was the only option. To be fair we stayed for 3 nights and they did leave a message on the 3rd morning that seemed to imply they would be able to offer another room but at that stage we didn\'t bother. The room was tiny, could barely squeeze by the bottom of the bed which was jammed up against the TV cabinet. I can\'t recall many hotels where 1 double bed is on offer - usually 2 single or 1 Queen/King. Room had not been re-done, and was 90\'s hotel style, dark greens and maroons and old wallpaper, though I see in other pictures there seem to be some rooms that have been done up. Bathroom adequate. Lobby large but crowded. Waiters friendly but drinks wildly overpriced. Seems as though the hotel is two hotels, perhaps a section of nicer rooms for those who are paying full price and a second section of rooms for cut prices. This creates a bit of an odd mix with the crowd as well. Location convenient, a bit of a business area but easy walk to Michigan Ave and other sights.'
4,'Great Location','This hotel is a 30 min walk from time square,5 mins from Macey\'s and opposite Penn Station.\r\nDont expect to get a lot of sleep as it appears to be must that if you drive in New York you have to constantly blast your horn....add that to the Police & Fire trucks you will need your ear plugs.\r\nThe hotels interior has been updated however many corners have been cut and for the price that you pay I would have expected a more sleek finish.\r\nWe requested a suite as there was three of us and the room its self was fine with tv in both bedroom and lounge area..kitchen area is great with all mod cons..however the bathroom is situated in the bedroom so if there are 3 of you sharing this suite its a little inconvenient at times..not the best lay out...\r\nThe beds are lovely and comfy with laods of pillows if you want..\r\nWe couldnt turn our heating off so we had to have the air con on so not ideal...\r\nStaff are very attentive and the option to check in on line and print your boarding pass is a big plus...\r\nWe did not eat at the restaurant as it was pricey..however Niles bar is fantastic for a light bite and a cocktail or 2..\r\nOverall a good hotel but nothing to shout about..'
3,'Everything was good except the room smelled','I booked this last minute for business and got a great price.\r\nThe hotel is centrally located downtown which makes it great for business or site seeing. I was able to check in 4 hours early, which is a big plus when you need to prepare for meetings. Breakfast at their Lockwood restaurant was good and the bar seemed to have a decent crowd.\r\nThe room was very big and clean, however there was one MAJOR issue. The room smelled like mildew. I would have changed my room but I had so many meetings, I didn\'t have time to deal with it. I will send a note to the managers, because, had the room not smelled, I would definitely come back for business.'
3,'Great location, but noisy and outdated','We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 2 nights. \r\nPros: \r\n- Convenient location, across from Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Subway stops, Macy\'s Herald Square\r\n- Spacious rooms\r\n- Kitchenette with sink, refrigerator and microwave\r\nCons:\r\n- Location next to NYPD substation and fire department made for a very noisy stay. We were on the 11th floor and the street noise, sirens, etc. still kept us awake. I had to go buy earplugs and sleep aids to help me get a good night\'s sleep on the 2nd night of our stay.\r\n- Lobby is beautiful, but it appears that the renovations were only to the first floor. Hallways and room decor were outdated.'
2,'D\'une tristesse...','Grande déception pour cet hôtel. OK c\'est Starck, mais du Starck qui a vieilli et pas très bien (c\'est souvent le cas du Starck vieillissant...). Malgré une reservation longtemps à l\'avance, nous avons attendu plus de 45 mins avant d\'avoir les clés de nos chambres. \r\nLa propreté de la chambre laisse un peu à désirer, mais le pire a été le bruit... Même les boules Quies n\'y ont rien fait...\r\nLe lendemain changement de chambre : une petite chambre si sombre que même à midi, il faut mettre la lumière - pardon les néons... Après visite d\'autres chambres, je peux vous confirmer que beaucoup de chambres sont minuscules et très très sombres. \r\nEn résumé, allez-y y prendre un verre; les bars sont bien plus sympas.'
4,'Well located, would stay here again','The foyer is a busy place. They need more seating for everyone who is trying to take advantage of the free wifi in the foyer.\r\nWe had 2 adults and 2 children for 6 nights and were very comfortable in a Corner double room. Bathroom is small, but the room size is generous for NYC standards. Always had to request extra towels as they never allowed for the 4th person. Not enough places to hang 4 towels to dry and re-use the following morning.\r\nTry to get a high floor to minimise the noise.\r\nBe aware that there is scaffolding around the front of the hotel.\r\nEasy to walk to Times Square, Rocckefeller Centre (Top of the Rock, NBC studios), MOMA, subways, 5th Ave and Central Park. Try the cafe across the street (53rd) for breakfast - very nice. Also, you must try the Hallal Guys meal trucks parked outside the hotel, but get in early as the lines can get very long after 9pm right through till midnight.'
4,'good hotel great loction','very helpful friendly staff, hotel well kept in the art deco style, we werelucky to be upgraded to a towersuite with balcony on the 38th floor looking toward the empire state building. With this we had breakfast in thesky lounge which had fantastic views & service was very good.'
3,'Nice option close to Penn Station and subway','The hotel met my expectations. The staff were polite and helpfull. It is in walking distance from Penn Station and the subway. The room was very confortable. I had some troubles site the wifi connection in my first night, but during the rest of my Staying everthing worked ok. Overall I had a great experience in The New Yorker, and I also got a nice discount at priceline.com'
5,Estadia,'La atencion del hotel es excelente, la predisposicion del personal tambien, Elizabeth es muy cordial y siempre brinda soluciones a los pasajeros, cada vez que vengo a NY me alojo en Park Central, la comodidad de las habitaciones es impecable, el desayuno completo y muy buenas condiciones, la ubicacion es ideal, lo recomiendo.'
4,'We Love the Affinia!!','This hotel is perfect if you\'re going to Madison Square Garden! The Affinia Manhattan is right across the street from MSG.\r\nWe have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan several times but this is the first time we have stayed since they updated the rooms. The room decor was very modern and chic. It was like we walked into a room that Candance Olsen designed on HGTV. The new furniture is sleek with clean lines, the flat screen TV is on the wall which really opens up the room. The bedding is white, crisp and clean and the bed is the most comfortable bed EVER.\r\nEnjoy the rubber ducky that is available upon request and there is a pillow menu with 6 different pillows you can select from. Set up an account with Affinia before your stay and select your amenities and pillow prior to your stay. Everything will be in your room waiting for you and it saves you a call to order items after you arrive.\r\nWe ate at Niles restaurant (downstairs) for the first time and it was awesome. If you are staying at the Affinia you can get 20\% off your bill if you show your room key. With your room key you can also get 10\% off shopping at Macy\'s.\r\nOne piece of advice when booking your room; ask for a room that is NOT facing 31st street. That side of the hotel is literally next door to a fire station. The only down side to our visit this time was that we were on the 7th floor facing 31st street. There were extremely loud sirens all hours of the night. Also the Affinia is currently doing some work to the outside of the building on that side. \r\nA word of warning if you are sensitive to room temperature: This room was EXTREMELY hot. We had the thermostat turned completely off. Steam was pouring out of the heaters. We opened a couple of windows which created a wind tunnel (and wind tunnel sounds) in the room.\r\nWe also got room service (late night). The room service arrived quickly, the presentation was excellent, the person that delivered our food was extremely professional and the food was delicious. Try the lobster bisque if you have the opportunity.\r\nWe also went to the Donut Plant for the first time and Ayza Wine and Chocolate bar. Ayza was something that we stumbled upon as we were walking down the street. The lunch portions were perfect, the chocolates were decadent and the staff was wonderful. \r\nAlso you\'re looking for coffee; you will find several great options just steps away from the Affinia. Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and Tim Hortons are all very close by. There are also several restaurants to choose from just across the street (Mustang Harry\'s is great and so is the Flying Puck for hockey fans).'
4,'Paddy\'s day trip to New York','Very good location, next to madison Square garden and Penn station. Room was spacious and clean, not the most modern but comfortable. Everything worked fine, no hassles and there was a 24 hour diner attatched to the hotel which was excellent. Just around the corner from tourist buses too. Staff were very helpful and there was a great view from the hotel room. Would definitely stay here again.'
5,'La posizione è stra-vincente','Ottimo albergo, prezzo non troppo accessibile ma veramente di qualità top class. Ci ho soggiornato per una settimana in aprile 2012, massima pulizia e ottimo servizio di conciergie, che ha saputo consigliarmi ristorantini ottimi e itinerari per visitare Manhattan. Lo consiglio fortemente per la sua posizione, a un passo (davvero un passo!) da Times square e da una fermata della metro. È ottimo per chi non vuole sbattersi anche alla sera nel prendere la metro per arrivare a Times square. Da notare anche la silenziosità nonostante la posizione (la mia camera era situata al 22 piano vista Times square)'
5,'Great choice!','Just stayed at this location this week, I can\'t say enough about how great the service was, great location. The rooms are small but most are small in NYC. Had a great trip and vert glad we chose this hotel.'
4,'Good Standard ideally situated hotel','Just back from a five nights stay with friends. Hotel staff friendly, rooms and bathrooms clean and the tick tock diner was handy for breakfast.Because of the hotel\'s location to many of the sights we wanted to see, we were able to walk rather than rely on the subway to get around. 2minutes to macys, 10 minutes to the empire state building, 15 to times square and 20 minutes to the rockafeller centre and abercrombie & fitch. We did use the subway to go to ground zero and to catch the ferry to liberty & ells island. Would recommend you take one of the bus trips available on your first day to familiarise yourself with Manhattan - well worth the money.'
4,'ottima posizione, pulito e ben frequentato','la stanza era di dimensioni ridotte ed il bagno piccolissimo. Buona la pulizia delle stanze, cambio asciugamani e lenzuola su richiesta.\r\nPosizione ottima, a poca distanza da times square e pochi metri dal madison square garden; sotto l\'hotel c\'era la fermata della metro e vicino si trova anche la Port Authority, dove partono autobus per gli aeroport e per washington; la zona dell\'albergo molto frequentata anche di notte. uscivano spesso a anche a piedi.\r\nun pò caro rispetto agli standard europei, ma alberghi di categoria inferiore ce li hanno sconsigliati.\r\nNew york è fantastica nel periodo di natale. Vacanza stupenda!!!!'
5,'Palmer House dips into the elegant past','It is such a nice surprise to not expect much and get much more than you expected. This was my experience at the Hilton Palmer House. Just walk in the lobby and you go back to a grander time when women were ladies and men were gentlemen. It is a work of art to behold. Our accommodations were a treat to have two bathrooms in a lovely suite on the Executive Level. It is worth more than the upgrade costs to have breakfast and afternoon treats. Plus, it has a bar in the event you do not want to wander downstairs to the lobby bar. One more thing, if you have time to take the Palmer House history tour, do so. Ken Price is the historian extraodinaire who will take you places others only dare to imagine. Wonderful service and style. Treat yourself to the Palmer House...one of my friends is doing so in September! Lucky her! One more tip, ask for David if you want the best massage of your life!'
3,'Buena ubicación, habitaciones claustrofobicas.','Muy buena ubicación, practicamente al lado de central park, la entrada es muy dificil de encontrar, es enana.\r\nLas habitaciones son ridiculamente enanas, no te puedes ni mover, el baño muy pequeño y la ducha da directamente a la habitación con un cristal, divertido si vas en pareja un poco incomodo si vas con amigos. El aire acondicionado o te congelas o te mueres de calor.\r\nServicio correcto, la terraza, restaurantes y ambiente en general moderno e interesante, pero al final lo que cuenta es la habitación y se han pasado, no descansas bien.'
3,'Expensive and overated.','I expect so much more for a 4 star hotel. The room is really tiny. It was my honeymoon and we asked to change us for a bigger room and the didn`t. We have to mange our space with the luggage. The bathroom`s door didn`t lock and the shower flooded all the time. \r\nThere is no bellman when you arrive if your luggages and the same don`t help you when you`re leaving the hotel till your cab.\r\nThe location is good. Near the subway, Madison Square Graden, many stores, touristic places and restaurants.\r\nThe wi-fi is free.\r\nIt`s not a charming hotel, but a huge touristic one. I wouldn`t come back.'
2,Sub-par,'Stayed here XMAS week and would NOT return. Entered the room to find clubs of hair under the bathroom vanity, stains on the rug, dust in corners. The decor is like a middle of the road airport motel. Only good thing was the location. Another couple who were traveling with us said that they had stayed two years before and remembered it to be a better experience.'
5,'Fantastic Hotel','On my fourth vist to NYC in two years, I finally found a hotel that lived up to my expectations. The room was spacious (for New York hotels anyway), the hotel staff friendly, accommodating, and courteous, and the view of Times Square was fabulous. At that time, they were renovating the elevators, and the only time our wait exceeded a few minutes was on Saturday night when they had some proms and meetings going on. I would not hesitate to recommend the Marquis to anyone who visits NYC where on business or pleasure. No chain beats Marriott in the hotel business...'
4,'Marriott Times Square','Excellent location and spacious rooms. Breakfast Buffet was pricey but not unexpected for Times Square. Better off grabbing breakfast at Junior\'s across the street.'
4,'Emplacement idéale, globalement bien','Cet hôtel est idéalement placé pour visiter New York, à un point vraiment central de la ville, Time Square à 10 minutes de là. En ce qui concerne l\'hôtel lui même, il est de bonne qualité. Je vous recommande au moment de réserver de préciser que vous désirez une chambre dans les étages élevés, la vue est saisissante (nous étions au 36ème étage sur 40) et c\'est impressionnant. Nous avions une chambre standard, malheureusement petite, on s\'attend à plus grand dans un quatre étoiles, mais ce sont les normes à NYC. L\'hôtel était globalement propre, ménage quotidien dans les chambres. La décoration de l\'hôtel et de la chambre étaient soignées. Vous pouvez également réserver une voiture (ou limousine pour l\'aéroport directement à l\'hôtel) ce qui est très pratique bien qu\'il y ait énormément de taxis (station devant l\'hôtel). Également à votre disposition le Tic Toc dinner qui sert des petits déjeuner fabuleux.'
2,Disappointed,'Staff was not friendly; acted like they were doing you a favor at check-in and check-out. There was a mouthwash bottle on the base of the toilet left from previous guest. Wallpaper was peeling; touch up paint was needed on shelves, frames, etc. The worst part was the bathroom door. It was supposed to slide and both my husband and I felt like we were going to throw our backs out trying to close and open it. Except for the bed, there was nothing luxurious about the room. The towels felt like sandpaper, the bathtub dripped the whole time and the shower was more of a trickle than a luxurious spray. There was a tray from room service with garbage on it on the floor outside one room for 2 days before it was removed. We\'re sure it was the same tray unless someone placed the empty Cherrios box in the exact same slant and spot on the tray each day. Went to buy something in the very, very small convenience shop and no one was there to accept payment so we couldn\'t buy anything. We never received the complimentary USA Today at our door. For the price, we didn\'t get what we were expecting. There are too many other hotels to choose from with hopefully a better experience. We would never stay at a Westin again.'
4,'Top Hotel !','Sehr gute zentrale Lage direkt am Times Square und am Broadway, gut geeignet für einen Musicalbesuch auch für Spätvorstellungen. Bei Nachfrage erhält man Zimmer mit Times Square Blick ohne Aufpreis. Sehr gute Möglichkeiten zum Sporttreiben (indoor). 2 Blocks zur nächsten U-Bahnstation. Das Essen war von minderer Qualität. In der Umgebung gibt es genug Möglichkeiten zu frühstücken, zu Mittag oder zu Abend essen zu gehen. Hier buchen wir wieder, wenn es nach New York geht.'
3,'Super Chic, Super Tiny - so chic it hurts','We were here for 1 night. The room was super small - it was a super, shall I say..um, efficient use of space? Not for larger people, you might be not able to fit through the doors.\r\nI\'m super surprised about how small the room actually was - I\'ve been in closets bigger, the washroom was tiny (smaller than washrooms in Paris, really). \r\nBut the location was good. The hotel is not well marked on the outside. The Lobby is amazing...the hotel is really dark by design.\r\nSo Chic it hurts...\r\nMy biggest pet peeve - there were no people at the front desk at check in - if check in is at 3pm, maybe you shouldn\'t send 3 of 5 staff away on break. They didn\'t seem to care about the growing lines either.'
4,'Idéalement situé...','Cet hotel idéalement situé, près de central park, times square, rockfeller center, 5ème avenue...\r\nLes chambres sont confortables, propres et possédent une bonne literie. Métro à proximité et beaucoup de restaurants autour de l\'hotel.'
1,'Please don\'t stay here........','What an awful experience! My wife and I would not usually write such a bad review if it wasn\'t justified but our time at the Pennyslvania was a nightmare. \r\nAfter leaving the relatively pleasant reception area the hotel goes downhill very quickly. The corridors are shabby, tired and in need of a total revamp. Our room was tiny with a view of a brick wall and was in need of a thorough clean.\r\nAfter our first night we attempted to leave the hotel to discover that the door would not lock from the outside therefore leaving all our valuable at risk. We reported this to reception who promised to send someone straight away. After an hour waiting in the room we reported the problem again only to be told that someone was on their way, a further hour later, sick of wasting our holiday in New York, we packed our bags and arrived at reception to be greeted by a very rude gentleman. He was totally uninterested in the problem and the fact that we were unable to secure our luggage. We demanded the hotel store our luggage whilst we went out and it required us to escalate this problem to the manager who was able to secure us a different room later that same day. \r\nUnfortunately, prior to leaving the UK, we had booked a further stay at the Pennyslvania later in our holiday. On our 2nd arrival we were allocated a room with a broken tap which could not be turned off. After a further room move we were allocated a large, but very unclean, room... the bathroom was covered in hairs which certainly didn\'t belong to us and the carpet was filthy and covered in cigarette burns.\r\nIn summary... Hotel is very TIRED, rooms are NOT CLEAN and staff are RUDE (although are probably overun with complaints day in day out). If you can afford just a little more money per night PLEASE stay elsewhere. The great location of this hotel does not begin to outweight the negatives...'
5,'Excelente hotel a pesar de lo antiguo','Muy cerca de todo!!!, de las atracciones típicas de New York,'
3,'Rooms toooo uncomfortable','Well, for sure not big enough for two adults and two teenagers - I have a 13 year old girl and 17 year old boy and was assured it would be big enough - NOT! The beds are stated to be Queen beds and they are most certainly double. IF they had been Queen as stated they may have worked for us but as it was we had my son on the floor two nights, my daughter in two chairs one night, and so on. They charged us 30.00 extra for both kids each night and it was very uncomfortable. Not a major thing but one that became annoying since they had on the reservations that there were four of us in the room - each night for all five nights that we were there, we only got three complete sets of towels and we had to call for the extra set each night waiting up until 2 1/2 hours one evening - I had to call back and they brought them right up. I complained and they gave us a voucher for two breakfast buffets.\r\nLocation was wonderful - in the middle of Times Square-you could get to everything'
2,'Would give this a miss next time I visit NYC','Our stay at the Westin was an odd one in that first impressions were not good, then the place grew on us and then it went downhill from there.\r\nCheck-in in the early hours of New Year\'s Eve went smoothly and we were assigned a room on 29th floor - deluxe king. It was about 2am and our key wouldn\'t work. That was finally solved and then we got into a room. It was located right next to the express lift shaft. The sounds of lifts passing was like a passing motor vehicle. There were four of them.\r\nThe room wasn\'t the cleanest I had seen either. There were long hairs on the desk chair and dust on the furniture.\r\nWe went back to the front desk and asked for a change of room which was greeted without a problem and the next day the change took place, albeit that there was confusion between the front desk and bellman as to whether the room was available or not, buy hey, this is a big hotel and it was busy. No problem.\r\nOur next room on 40th floor was much better, away from the lifts and had an even better view of the first, looking across Manhattan with a view of the soaring Empire State even when lying in bed! \r\nHowever, be warned that this is not a quiet hotel. There may be heavenly beds but the noise of people and doors clanging in the corridors simply couldn\'t be avoided and this was through until our departure on 6 Jan when the New Year crowd had all gone. Also, housekeeping arrive on the corridors about 8.30am and talk loudly. This simply wasn\'t on. \r\nThen there\'s the decor. The rooms look a bit like they\'ve been furnished out of Ikea. Okay for while I guess but I\'m not sure I would want to check into this hotel in say, 5 years. The rooms will be falling apart. The brushed steel sinks and units reminded me of a cross between prison cell ones (not that I\'ve been arrested!!) and operating theatres, and our heavenly bath had yellow staining by the taps, so we used the heavenly shower which was like, er, a regular shower. However, yes, the heavenly beds are just that, heavenly, but like I said earlier, shame about the noise outside the room that woke us.\r\nHaving said all this, the views were great, Bar 10 and Shula\'s were excellent. The staff in these establishments far exceeded that of the hotel staff which is very unsusual I think.\r\nWhat grated on us at the end of our stay was that housekeeping just gave up on the last day and didn\'t bother attending on us. We made a request at 2pm and another at 7pm and 8pm and then at 9pm someone finally brought some towels. This made us late for plans for out last night in NY and the attitude of staff was appalling. The front desk made no apology said it was sold out so housekeeping was on a request basis. 1) I did request it, 2) how would I know that the place was sold out anyway, and 3) I have never heard of this system in this standard of hotel before.\r\nWhen we finally got out that night, someone came and made the bed and took the rubbish but that was it. No refill of soap, water, coffee, tidy up etc.\r\nThen, on the day of check out, a $250 charge had mysteriously appeared on our bill from the health club. Not thinking this would be a problem if I raised it, I was greeted with suspicion and unprofessionalism. A call was made in front of me to the health club and I was made to wait. I was then told that I had signed a check and that it was being faxed over. When it arrived it clearly was not my signature but had my name on it. It also had a different room number. After a further wait and sample of my signature, I was told that the amount would be cleared and that they would investigate further. I understand that this may not have been the hotel\'s fault, or it may have simply been an error but what I did not like was the way I was made to feel as though I was pulling a fast one, and how there was no apology for the mistake and for taking up my time. During my waiting at the desk, I also discovered that I had been charged an extra $50 per night on my rate. \r\nIn essence, the majority of front desk staff could use a training course on hospitality and customer relations. \r\nWe then left, rather annoyed, tainting our stay at the Westin but certainly not New York! In future we\'ll stay elsewhere, and for $429 and $329 a night respectively, it will be in a far superior hotel if we avoid the holiday season.'
1,'Do not stay here','I had a reservation from Dec. 5 to Dec. 12, 2012 in a Penn 500 Room. I arrived almost at midnight to the hotel. Once I got my room I went upstairs. I opened the door and my room seemed to be occupied. The did check-out but never cleaned the room. So I went downstairs, they apologized, said they had no equivalent room but would take care of it the next day. I was given an alternate room.\r\nI gave the hotel a chance, went to the new room. Once I opened the door a pungent smell came out of the room. It smelled like a swamp. Really. The heater made a terrible noise and water was dripping to the carpet, hence the horrible smell. Went down again and was given a third room that was really unacceptable, loud and dirty.\r\nI walked out of the hotel. I cannot complain of the service since the Front Desk personnel and the manager tried to do their best with what the horrible facilities allowed. The y really tried but if the hotel facilities are junk, ther is so much they can do. I DO NOT recommend this hotel. My rate was $350/night. They did not charge me but I am still waiting for them to release the hold in my bank account of almost $3,000 for the 7 nghts.\r\nI will not stayhere even if they gave me a rate of $80/night. Find something else and avoid the trouble. Not worth it.'
3,'tiny guest rooms','We stayed in a GUEST ROOM and it was really ,really small.Rather a disappointment overall as it was a special trip and I had really researched hotels and the reviews on TA were excellent but I did not realise exactly what the guest rooms were.There was no room to have a bedside table on both sides of the bed-the actual room (minus the corridor from the door to bathroom )was about 11feet by 6 ft.The bed was comfortable but the room was a little noisy because it was next to the service elevator.The view was of a brick wall and we couldn\'t even see what the weather was like outside ! If you just want a bed ,this is fine-comfortable and clean,but you may prefer to check out other hotels ,or make sure you do not book a GUEST ROOM.The phots shows how small it was-a bedside table wider than the bed and my feet were touching the fridge beneath the window!'
4,'Atendeu as expectativas','Excelente localização, funcionários atenciosos. Ponto negativo é a internet ser cobrada!'
4,'Good hotel in Times Square','I spent two nights at the Westin with my wife and found little to complain about. The location is excellent and the rooms on upper floors offer great views. Our room was clean and well appointed (with a decent quality flat screen TV for example) if a little small - but this is NYC. The lobby was also clean and quiet. Although only one block off Broadway, the sound-proof windows in the rooms succeed in keeping most of the street noise out. They also open a couple of inches to let some air into the room if you need it. \r\nI was able to book this hotel on Hotwire for a reasonable rate and was given an upgrade when we arrived (to a higher floor). Only one word of warning - it took us a while (30-40 min) to recieve our luggage when we first arrived and you are required to give it up at the lobby security as you enter. If this is a security measure, I have no problem with it. Other than that, the staff were all very professional and fast. I would have no problem recommending this modern, well kept and well located hotel.'
1,'hated it','Today, for the first time ever, I checked out of a hotel before my stay was up. I was supposed to stay at this hotel for two nights (at $589 per night) and I was so unhappy with the hotel that I left it and decided to try somewhere else.\r\nAlthough the architecture of this hotel is interesting and the staff is friendly, I have never stayed in such a small hotel room. (I am a Native New Yorker, and I have stayed at hotels all around Manhattan.) There was a double bed in my room, and there was not more than 12 inches on either side of the bed. The bathroom was so tiny that my knees touched the wall as I sat on the toilet! The shower was similarly small. \r\nTrendy? I suppose. But this hotel was definitely not for me.'
5,Awesome,'What a marvellous hotel. \r\nFirst of all, the location is perfect, one block from times square, so you are close to the hustle and bustle but just far enough away for it to be a bit quieter. I think 8th Avenue is much better and 7th Avenue for places to eat, too. There was a starbucks in the hotel lobby, and numerous diners and a mcdonalds as soon as you walk out.\r\nThen, the building itself is breathtaking to look at. It has a striking shape and is coloured in different-tinted blue and purple glass which looks stunning.\r\nCheck-in and check-out was a doddle and the staff were always welcoming and friendly.\r\nFinally, we were a normal two double bed room, and the view was simply fantastic. We asked the guy if we could have the highest room we could get, and he jokingly said \'yeah, if you pay!\' but he had a look on his computer and put us in a higher room at the same rate. Our room was about half way up and we had a stunning view of the busy little Hudson river and could see miles into new Jersey. I\'d recommend taking a pair of binoculars with you and just look at the view from the room! You can also open the window a little bit and look below. We like to have it open and listen to the hustle and bustle of NY for a few minutes.\r\nAll in all, we couldn\'t have wished for a better experience than we had at the Westin, and it was reasonably priced, too.'
3,'Great locations, big hotel, no special treatment.','Good place to stay, with standard services, don´t expect much.'
3,'Not as bad as people are making out!!','We have just come back from Hotel Penn after spending 4 nights there. \r\nThe hotel in itself is pretty basic but our room on the 7th floor was ok. The room was cleaned every day and there was no sign of any mould or exposed wires!! The only gripes i do have about the hotel and NY people in general is how unfriendly people are!! Flora and Vlada on reception are very unhelpful and treat you like a piece of dirt off their shoe!! The hotel phone is very very expensive, try not to use it. \r\nOnly other gripe is waiting for someone to help you when you want something from your safety deposit box, it takes forever and people had took to writing \'hurry up\' on the signs in there!!\r\nAll in all, the hotel room was adequate, pretty basic but clean, tidyand warm with all amenities.\r\nAs the saying goes, \'you get what you pay for so if people don\'t want a budget hotel they need to be prepared to pay for a hotel that isn\'t budget class instead of moaning!!'
5,'Great stay at Hilton','This is our second stay at Hilton New York and we had great time being in middle Manhattan (Broadway theatres, Time Square, Central Park).\r\n We have used Expedia to book the trip (three nights hotel and flight). We arrived early morning (7:30AM) and, to our surprise, we had already the room assigned, as per our preference, requested at booking. However, not being ready, we left the luggage with the attendant and went for a stroll in the city.\r\nAt our return, after lunch, were handed the room keys with a warm welcome. Our room was large, newly remodeled and had very comfortable beds. Also, was clean and very quiet, being at higher floor.\r\nThe hotel personnel were very helpful (especially getting a cab during evening hours). We had a comfortable stay at this hotel and we will use it in the future, also recommend it to our friends.'
5,'Excellent hotel','What a great hotel. Beautiful room, excellent facility and attention to detail. Bar is expensive and I did find the walls a tiny bit thin. But the location, room size, tidiness, understated trendy elegance and little touches made this place a destination I hope to return to.'
4,'Excellent Experience...','Stayed in the hotel for a few nights for a short break to New York, and were told it was close to Times Square....it may as well have been IN Times Square. It\'s a 15 second walk right to the heart. The location couldn\'t be better for the price you pay for the Edison. The building itself is beautiful. The art deco lobby is stunning, and you could easily mistake it for something much more classy than a 3* hotel. The rooms themselves were good too, very clean and with good air conditioning. They could do with a slight upgrade to match the rest of the hotel (lobby etc) as they are looking a bit aged now, but you probably wont be spending much time in the room when you have Broadway and Times Sq down the street.\r\nThe chambermaids do an excellent job cleaning, especially if you see the equipment they have to use. The vacuum cleaners look like they were made around the same time as the hotel itself (1931 btw), but as I say, they do an impeccable job.\r\nDefinitely recommended if you are looking for a reasonably priced, clean, comfortable and secure base to camp for the night if visiting NYC.'
4,'Great location and helpful staff','In NYC for just a job interview. The Park Central is located among many restaurant choices and near Central Park. The room was clean and comfortable...but the highlight of the stay was the Guest Relations Manager, Elizabeth. I was running late for my interview and need a few pages printed in a hurry. She could have easily sent me to the business center ($0.75/page), but instead she printed what I needed while I waited at the front desk. She was a great help and I was on time for my interview. Fyi...I didn\'t get the job, but would definitely stay here again.'
3,'Probably Great If You Don\'t Use Priceline','We stayed for 1 night 8-21 for personal travel. We were a party of 3, 2 adults and a 2 year old. I booked on Priceline as we always do for Chicago. In the past we have always gotten the Hyatt Regency on the river. The Hyatt is amazing and have always had an amazing stay. The Hyatt must have been booked because we ended up here.\r\nBefore arrival I emailed and used Facebook to inform the hotel that we would be traveling with a 2 year old. I did not think I needed to specify that we needed a non smoking room with a 2 year old. When we checked in they informed us that they were booked full and all that was left for us was a smoking room, This was a Tues afternoon at 3:10. But they would be happy to upgrade us to the executive floor where we would get two beds and two bathrooms. She said we would want two beds since we had our daughter along. BUT it is still a smoking room. I said no thanks we just need one bed in a non smoking room we have our own pack and play. She said oh they have pack and plays we did not need to bring ours. Really a Pack and Play that has been in a smoking environment is suitable for a child to sleep in? I informed her that we would absolutely not be staying in a smoking room and that I requested a non smoking one. She then informed me that because I chose to use priceline that I do not get to pick my room and that I would get was leftover after their regular paying guests got the requested rooms. She said that is the chance you take when booking to save money. I have never had any issues at any other hotel using priceline. Not sure why a hotel would participate in priceline if this is the way they operate. I let her know that I was shocked that they even still allowed smoking in their hotel and she said oh yes that is why our customers book here. I said well thanks on that case I will head to another hotel. Miraculously a room on the 17th floor was available but it was a non smoking entertainment suite that had no bed. They could bring us up roll aways. We decided that would be ok not a big deal to us. We had a sleeping child on our shoulder.\r\nThe room was outdated and dingy. It was rather large with a wet bar area, 2 floor to ceiling windows. Plenty of room except the tiny bathroom. We were on the Hilton Honors floor. They brought our luggage and the roll aways. The beds were like sleeping on concrete. Pillows and linens were fine. Room was clean, some stains on the furniture. The time we were there we were in and out of our room over 20 times, amazingly we barely even saw another guest, not sure how the hotel was booked full.\r\nThe hotel is neat inside and about one block from Millennium Park. Nice area. The bellman and doorman were wonderful along with the valets. It was $62 for valet for one day but with a two year old we don\'t mind. We were in and out with the car at least 10 times. We expect to pay that much for valet and we need it. The Hyatt Regency is only $25 a night and you can come in and out as many times as you want also.\r\nDid not eat or drink there or use anything else in the hotel besides our room. Next time I book for the city on Priceline I will choose the next area North so as to not get this hotel again. It is a shame, if they would just treat everyone the same this hotel would have been great. Still shocked that you could smoke in a hotel today. They allow pets, but I would never let my dog sleep on a carpet doused in smoke.'
5,'Absolutely AMAZING!','The location is fantastic, but above that, the staff at the hotel is extremely warm and friendly. Rooms are big compared to other rooms in NYC. We stayed on the 21st floor and had the most amazing view of Times Square. Again, I can\'t say enough about it! Clean fabulous rooms with amazing views and a fantastic staff!'
5,'Great hotel; great views; great location.','This hotel is a favorite of ours, with phenomenal views (from King Corner rooms especially), and an ideal location just one block west of Times Square. We were there five nights, and enjoyed the Starbucks practically in the hotel (need my early morning fix). With the blue line subway about thirty steps from the front door of the hotel, we could easily get to wherever we were headed very easily.'
4,'Mittendrin und empfehlenswert','Wir waren für eine Nacht im Marriott Marquis, was sich direkt am Times Square befindet. Zentraler geht es also kaum. Der Check-in verlief problemlos, auch wenn hier ganz schön viel los war. Aber das lässt sich bei einem Hotel dieser Größe nicht vermeiden. Wir hatten ein schönes großes Zimmer im 32. Stock mit einem tollen Blick auf den Hudson River. Das Zimmer hatte zwei große Betten, Sitzecke, Flat-TV, Kaffeemaschine und ein großes Bad mit Badewanne.\r\nBesonders interessant sind auch die innenliegenden, verglasten Fahrstühle mit denen man transportiert wird und gleichzeitig auch in die einzelnen Etagen oder auf das Fitnesscenter schauen kann. Kleiner Tipp: man gibt vorher seine gewünschte Etage ein und bekommt dann automatisch einen Fahrstuhl zugewiesen, der dorthin fährt. Im Fahrstuhl selbst ist eine Etagenauswahl nicht mehr möglich.\r\nIm Hotel selbst gibt es verschiedene Restaurants und Bistros sowie einen Starbucks. Im oberen Stockwerk gibt es das View-Restaurant (gehoben) sowie die View Lounge.\r\nBei späterer Abreise kann man sein Gepäck auch problemlos unterstellen.'
3,'Small Rooms in a Big city....','We stayed in the Hudson from Friday Oct 6th - Wednesday Oct 11th. We did some homework on this hotel so we knew what to expect. Decor wise it lived up to its expectations. The main problems we encountered were the lack of co-ordination and management of the check in area. There always appeared to be a large number of people waiting. The people behind the desk, were mostly friendly but stretched and stressed and there didnt appear to be anyone in charge who could co-ordinate what needed to be done. Over all from the door-man to the cleaning staff most people we encountered were friendly and polite. \r\nNow I turn to our box for a room! Ok, I have stayed in many hotels around the world and a hotel in Amsterdam was holding our record for being small but the Hudson takes the award by a mile! It was tiny! Now again we did look into the hotel before booking it so we knew it would be small but you really dont get a feel for the size of the room until you get in there. It is a room not to stay in for any lenght of time, just to sleep, shower and store your bags nothing else. The interesting and unusual window beside the bath/shower looking onto the bed took a bit of getting use to. If your\'e into exhibitionism then by all means keep the curtain open so your partner can see you shower as they relax on the bed! The space provided for the TV, CD player, safe etc does what its supposed to store out of sight. Dont go near the sweets or water left for you as even the small bottle of water left on the table was $6. There are plenty of stores near by so go out and buy your own bottled water and candy if you so wish. Overall this hotel served its purpose, sleep and shower nothing else. Its clean, well kept and the location is fine just dont expect anything else and you will be happy.'
5,'Fantastic Location','Booked this last minute for 1 night at New year 05-06. Was pleasently surprised. The hotels location was fantastic. Directly in the middle of times square with a tube station across the road so access could be gained to everywhere. Hotel was lovely decorated and the beds were extremly comfortable. Highly recommended. Any questioin s just ask??'
4,'Centralissimo, pulito e personale disponibile','L\'hotel è a due minuti a piedi da Times Square, assolutamente centralissimo. Appena fuori la recepion c\'è la fermata della metropolitana dove passano ben tre linee, in 10 minuti di metro si arriva a Wall Street. Central Park anche è facilmente raggiungibile a piedi, massimo 5 minuti. E a 5 minuti è anche la 5ta strada. \r\nL\'hotel è abbastanza pulito e il personale è cordiale. Le camere vengono rifatte tutti i giorni, gli asciugamani cambiati solo se li si lascia a terra. Con 10 dollari ti danno la macchinetta del caffè americana da tenere in camera per tutto il soggiorno e con uso illimitato del caffè (se s finiscono le cialde basta telefonare al servizio in camera e le portano in 5 minuti). Noi avevamo solo il pernottamento, quindi con la macchinetta del caffè e dei biscotti abbiamo risolto il problema della colazione in modo simpatico ed economico. Se si vuole cmq sotto l\'hotel ci sono 2-3 caffetterie.\r\nSconsiglio di usare il telefono, una telefonata di 3 minuti ad una mia amica a NYC mi è costata 10 dollari! Non oso immaginare in Italia!!\r\nNon so dare un giudizio sul cibo perchè non ho mai mangiato lì, quindi non saprei proprio.\r\nLe camere sono silenziose (noi affacciavamo sulla trafficatissima 7ma ma abbiamo dormito come ghiri, nessun rumore). In camera ti forniscono di shampoo, saponette e asciugacapelli (io ho fatto la cretinata di occupare spazio in valigia con il mio, che alla fine funzionava male perchè lì hanno i 110 e non la 220 come da noi, quindi non funzionerebbe bene neanche il silk epil, ecc). C\'era anche l\'asse da stiro con il ferro da stiro, la cassaforte gratuita in camera e una scrivania. Nella hall c\'è il wireless gratuito. Non abbiamo visitato il fitness centre (camminavamo già abbastanza durante la giornata!!!).'
3,'No volvería a elegirlo','Según la recomendación de mi agente de viaje, era un hotel sencillo, promedio, para pasar la noche. Siendo tan cara la hotelería en New York dijo que estaba dentro de las alternativas más adecuadas.\r\nSe rescata fuertemente la ubicación, a un paso de todo. Es un hermoso paseo para la noche ir caminando por la Séptima hasta Times Square.\r\nLa habitación diminuta, parecía construída en los años 50 y recién pintada a las apuradas: pintura salpicada en los azulejos, y por enduído sin haberlo lijado previamente.\r\nBien la climatización y silenciosa, a pesar de estar en piso 8 no llegaba ruido de la calle ni del pasillo.\r\nMucha espera para el check in (tal como lo había leído en críticas de otros viajeros) y las dos veces en toda la semana que me acerqué a preguntar algo a front desk esperé muchísimo y había gente quejándose de la habitación y pidiendo cambio.\r\nDefinitivamente, merece una remodelación'
5,'Christmas in New York = Beautiful!!','Although I understand this is a review about the hotel, I would also love to review the city!!!\r\nThe Hilton New York was great. Not one problem. It\'s a Hilton, exactly what you\'d expect. I didn\'t eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel, we just strolled down the streets and ate anywhere looked good. There is one street vendor who cooks up Greek food (gyros, souvlaki...) across the street from the hotel and you HAVE to try his food...awesome!! You might have to wait a bit though cause his line-ups are long, but well worth it. \r\nThe staff was good and effecient. The rooms were perfect, clean and a good size. Nice flat panel t.v\'s and the most comfortable bed I think I\'ve ever slept in. The soft duvet and pillows....ahhh...just what we needed after walking the city for 12 hrs!! The elevators were very quick - which you don\'t find in a lot of hotels ( I have no patience so I hate waiting for elevators). The locations was perfect for us. Close to Rockerfeller Center (which we wanted) and close enough to walk to Times Square & Macy\'s (about 10-15 mins walk). We walked to both shows (Mamma Mia & The Rockette Christmas Spectacular). \r\nYou really won\'t need to taxi it anywhere unless you plan to visit the financial district (ground zero, statue of liberty)...I guess it depends on what you are going to New York to do. We shopped (a lot), watched a couple shows, skated at Rockerfeller Center, visited Top of the Rock, went to beautiful (and it is indeed beautiful) Bryant Park, Macy\'s, Central Station, Madison Square Gardens, & basically that\'s all we had time for (3 days) and we didn\'t have to taxi it anywhere from the Hilton. We did take a short bike-taxi back to our hotel one day only cause our feet hurt so much after 2 full days of walking!! \r\nI can\'t wait to go back and visit other areas we didn\'t get to see. Bring good walking shoes!!\r\nI love NY...go....it\'s awesome.'
4,'Fab 1st time in NYC','Great hotel for location, close to Time Square, Grand Central Station, Central Park and the beautiful Bryant Park. The hotel was clean and staff very curious.We found the bedrooms a little small for a family of four but to be honest we didnt spend much time in the rooms as we spent our five days out sightseeing from 8am to 6pm each day, but we returned each day to a hot shower, plenty of clean towels and a comfy bed. An added extra, tea and coffee facilities in the room would be nice. Our holiday was to celebrate my husband\'s 50th birthday, which the travel company had highlighted in our booking, but this wasnt recognised by the hotel, some sort of upgrade or even a basket of fruit would have been a nice gesture and greatly apprecited. Overall we had a fantastic time in NYC. We would love to return one day, and wouldnt hesitate in booking this hotel or recommending to a friend.'
3,'Not what I expected','Yes, the location is great if you like theatre and crowds, but the room I had on the 30th floor was small. The view was fun, though. The other good thing was the great dual-head shower and the comfy bed. Other than that, I had a lot of complaints considering how much I paid. When I first got in the room, I turned on all the lights to unpack my suitcase, but I literally could not see inside my bag while I unpacked it on the bench where one is supposed to put suitcases. The lighting was awful. Even the reading light by the bed was inadequate for the purpose. The bathroom was super-small and the annoying tiny metal sink and shelf made me think I was on an airplane. There was simply no room on the tiny shelf to place more than a few objects and I had the usual make-up kit, hair products and toothbrush, etc and they all would not fit. There is also very little closet space (1/2 a regular one) or drawer space. The shower curtain was inadequate as water puddled up on the bathroom floor, which is dangerous and slippery--and I closed the curtain well! Weirdly, I was told upon check-in that if I so much as moved an item in the snack-bar/fridge, I would be charged for it, so I can\'t imagine that even having the little fridge in the room is useful to more than just a very few guests who are willing to buy that stuff. \r\nI called the service express 4 separate times for things over the course of my stay and never once did they answer before the 10th ring. \r\nAnyway, I plan to chose another hotel next time, although I usually like Westin.'
3,'A New York experiential hotel','We stayed in the Hudson Hotel for three nights during Christmas, 2007. The location is great, just a block from Columbus circle and the South End of Central Park. The hotel was booked through Priceline bidding-only $100 a night-and that price, although low for NYC, seems fair for the Hudson. The hotel is extremely stylized/trendy/urban chic, so much so that there is no Hudson Hotel sign on the exterior of the hotel. Having found it by the address, we entered glass doors to an escalator taking us up to the hotel lobby. The lobby is very dimly lit, adding to the ambiance, and is also attractively decorated, with comfortable seating. Too dim for reading, but good if you are waiting for someone. There are two bars, both with great design and decor, but expensive drinks ($9 for a bottle of beer) and a restaurant with $18 burgers. But then this is midtown Manhattan. There were many Europeans staying in the hotel, fortunate people able to eat and drink on the strength of the Euro. \r\nThe rooms have been discussed in many other posts, and they are every bit as tiny as described. In our case, the rooms were clean, my number one criterion, and well supplied, so I didn\'t want to complain about the size. But by the end of our three day stay, I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE! I saw many families while I was there and I couldn\'t imagine how they managed to coexist in those rooms. \r\nI would recommend the Hudson Hotel for the convenient location and the decor.'
2,'There must be better places for the money','The room was small, the bathroom was not clean, wet towels were not replaced and the tub faucet dripped, dripped, dripped. Two requests did not result in any repair of the tub faucet; although we got a boat load of towels we did not need. Staff was courteous and we did get a breakfast coupon, which was a nice place. Breakfast was delicious. Next time, though I\'ll pay for my breakfast if the accommodations were better.'
3,'Hotel und Discothek','Insgesammt ist das Hotel sehr dunkel, da die Wände grau-braun gestrichen sind. Fährt man die Rolltreppe zur Rezeption hoch, dann ist das erste was einem auffällt eine RIESIGE und LAUTE Diskothek ! Da könte es passieren, dass man die nächsten Nächte nicht schlafen kann ! Deshab ist es empfelenswert ein Zimmer im 6. Stock oder höher zu nehmen. Außerdem sind die Zimmer dicht aneinander und die Türen sehr dünn, d.h.: wird die Tür des Nachbarzimmers geöffnet könnte man glauben es versucht gerade jemand die eigene Tür zu öffnen oder einzubrechen. Lassen sie sich daran nicht stören !!! Es ist zwar möglich im Hudson Hotel zu frühstücken, allerdings kann das schnell sehr teuer werden. Da empfielt es sich in das nächstgelegene Frühstückslokal The Flame zu gehen.\r\nDas Hudson Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen, nur zwei Straßen vom Central Park entfernt und liegt fast direkt gegenüber von The Warner Center in der Nähe vom Columbus Circle. Der Zimmerservice und das Personal sind sehr freundlich und haben für jede Frage ein offenes Ohr. Außerdem gibt es im 15. Stock einen kostenlosen und schnellen Internetzugang.'
4,'Perfect location!','My family stayed here for 4 days and loved it. Usually rooms in NYC are extremely small compared to other major US cities but this one was not so bad. There were 4 of us and we managed quite well in one room (36th floor). It was clean and had very comfortable beds. This is not our first time in NY but it was our first time in this hotel and I can\'t believe how convenient it was. It is right next to 1 subway stop and very close to another. The following restaurants are within steps of the hotel: Starbucks, McDonalds, Shake Shack, and a health food take out place. And that\'s not including all that is available at Times Square! The benefit is that when you travel with kids and you want to keep breakfast expenses down, it is VERY easy and convenient to do so. And because it is a little set back from Times Square, you get all of the advantages of being close but without having all the noise. Awesome! The only thing I would suggest to management is to do a little reno job on the bar; it needs a bit of a refresher.'
4,'Weihnachtsshopping in NY','Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, direkt neben dem Madisson Square Garden und nur wenige Minuten von Macys entfernt. Zur U-Bahn sind es ebenfalls nur wenige Schritte.\r\nBis zum Times Square läuft man ca. 10-15 Minuten.\r\nDie Zimmer sind relativ klein, aber sehr sauber. Der Service ist typsich für NY ein wenig zurückhhaltend. Dennoch waren wir bereits zum 2. Mal dort und können es empfehlen.\r\nWir hatten beim 2. Mal ein Zimmer (Mini-Suite) mit Blick auf den Hudson inkl. kleinem Frühstück.\r\nDie Lobby ist ein wenig unperösnlich und relativ lauit.\r\nAllerdings hat uns der Art-Deco Stil sehr gut gefallen.'
5,'en plein coeur de Manhattan - MAGNIFIQUE','Nous avons sejourné 5 jours et 4 nuits dans ce magnifique hotel situé en plein coeur de Manhattan. A 2 min de Columbus Circus, 2 min apied de 5 eme Avenue et de Brodway.\r\nChambre petite mais tres sympa. Avec baignoire et TV - chaine hi fi.\r\nPersonnel super. Le concierge vous reserve le resto ou vous voulez diner le soir. \r\nToujours des taxis dispo devant l hotel\r\nDeco du hall et du bar MAGNIFIQUE. au premier abord, on ne dirait pas du tout un hotel. Le resto est tres bon mais nous n avons pas pris de petit dej car il y a le Pain Quotidien a 2 min a pied ou les petits dej sont fantastiques!!!\r\nBref, court sejour mgnifique. A refaire!!!'
2,'Good location - dismal rooms and service.','I needed to make a quick business trip to NYC and chose the Hotel Pennsylvania because of the location across from Penn Station. While on the surface it looks like a full-service hotel, don\'t expect much. Check-in on a Tuesday with only four people ahead of me in line was a 25 -minute wait. My room was dismal - very dark (no lighting except for a dim, bedside lamp) and unrenovated with a cramped bathroom with cracked walls and peeling paint. There was a refrigerator, which I did appreciate. The internet access (not wireless) was not working, but calls to get help were met with answering machines and no returned calls so I was forced to walk elsewhere for internet access to get some work done. The lobby is clean and gives the appearance of an updated, bustling hotel, and I did feel safe there. Location is the best thing this hotel has to offer, but if you are looking for even a decent room and amenities, look elsewhere. For the same rates, you can do better, even in NYC.'
1,'2 star hotel','here\'s a letter I wrote to the Hyatt post my stay summarizing the experience:\r\nI recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York from Nov 8 - Nov 11 in room 1908. It was a truly miserable and forgettable experience. There were several issues with the hotel that I list below:\r\n1. I arrived at the hotel on Monday evening and was told the only available rooms left were double beds. I specifically booked a king size bed which was guaranteed but apparently the hotel does not honor guarantees. The room was very dark and I asked for an extra lamp but this was not available either.\r\n2. On my arrival, I found that the bathroom smelled like urine. The stench was so strong that it came into the room and I had to keep the bathroom door shut throughout the night. It was the most putrid and repulsive smell and something you would not find even in a hostel. I called the front desk and asked to move to another room but was told there were no rooms available. There was no offer for someone to come up and clean the bathroom\r\n3. The heat in my room did not work despite turning the thermostat to 90 degrees\r\n4. It took 15 minutes before hot water came on in the shower. The wait not only meant I was late for my meetings but also that I had to endure the urine smell for longer\r\n5. Being a member of Hyatt Gold Passport I thought I would at least get my room request, but that is clearly not the case. Starwood Preferred Guest puts the Hyatt loyalty program to shame\r\n6. The market below is nice but even 2 star hotels usually have in room mini-bars\r\nAll in all my stay was a horrible experience. It is simply a 2 star hotel for a 4 star price. I hope the hotel reviews its policies and quality control soon as there are many better hotels in NYC.'
4,'Old fashioned style hotel but comfortable','As i said this is an old hotel and has been kept that way. The rooms are not big but by New York standards they are good sized. Room was clean and had plenty of towels. If i had to find a complaint it would be that the bed was a bit harder than we are used to and there was only 1 pillow each, but i am sure if i had asked we would have got more. The hotel is as close as you get to times square. We had a great view of a brick wall, lol.\r\nDont go to the ROXY for breakfast, cost $55 for 2 coffee\'s, 1 Juice and 2 Breakfasts. Found a great place down the road, on the Cnr of 8th and W 47th st (same road as the hotel) $2 for a bagel and coffee, or $5.50 for an omlette. Staff there were nice too.'
4,'Great location and executive level room size is nice and roomy','Our family stayed for 7 nights over Spring Break this year. First time in N.Y. and we were totally clueless about where to stay. Felt a sense of comfort knowing this was the Westin. We are SPG members and used points for 2 of our nights. Great choice. Pros~ We were given the opportunity to remain in the same room even though we had multiple reservations. Beds were extremely comfortable and rooms were quiet and recently updated. Temperature in rooms was excellent. WIndows opened slightly for us to feel the snow falling one morning. Executive level staff was very attentitive to our needs at all open hours. Willing to go into the back for soft drinks upon request as children are not juice or coffee lovers in the am. Elevators worked like a charm-nice and speedy-never a long wait. Connected to a movie theater and a starbucks on side wing. A great tex-mex restaurant also connected. Check in was speedy and courteous. We were put in a room that was larger than nearby rooms. Plenty of shampoo and lotions each day. Bathroom was clean and tidy. Shower head was double and water was always nice and hot. Towels were soft and clean. Breakfast was always hot and fresh each morning. I loved the hot oatmeal. Some mornings, it seemed watery but mostly it was thick and creamy. Having the Port Authority just a hop,skip and a jump really aided us well as we always felt like we had nearby subway stop or bus ride. We used the taxi to get from Newark upon arrival (DO NOT DO THIS) Take the bus from Newark if you are staying at this hotel as the ride was very pleasant and comfortable and a little cheaper.\r\nCons~Having a computer in our room but internet access was an additional charge. This was very misleading as we asked our reservationist and was told internet access was free. Upon checking with front desk, we were told we had to go to executive lobby for it to be free. :( No use having a computer in our room. Our room had a view of the tops of buildings nearby and of Madame Tousseau\'s sign. Was hoping for a partial times square view but understandably at this level that was near impossible. The neighborhood immediately surrounding was not the best but we were always alert and traveled in group. Lobby was a little too plain and drab. Staff was not overly friendly~courteous, but not overly friendly. We were not given Metro cards per our reservation details (some sort of sports pkg.). We realized this after and we didn\'t need it anymore. Bell men never greated us each time we walked in the door throughout our stay. A simple hello would have gone a long way. One day our maid skipped our room but we made a call and service was prompt. Bathroom shelf was small and placed poorly in the bathroom. (above the toilet and sink) We had a disaster with make up bag falling into the toilet. I had remembered reading about this after it happed to us. :( \r\nOverall we loved this hotel and there were no hidden surprises except for the internet access charge. I would recommend this hotel.'
3,'Hotel on Time Square','Stayed at this hotel for 1 week. Very nice hotel, rooms were nice, beds were good. There is only two complaint that I have: 1 internet. For the price that is charged, I would have thought maybe the hotel can offered this to the guests for no fees or if charging a fee, we would be able to use more that 1 computer. When we checked out, we found out there was a charge on our room from the restaurant. We did use the restaurant once but paid with our visa. The waitress did not asked us if we were staying at the hotel so have no idea how we were charged. So far, still waiting to receive an email if we will be credit. Of course, we had to pay. We also found the internet very slow - McDonald\'s wifi was faster!! We complained and was told - what did we expect, this was a big hotel - if it is a big hotel - get a faster server - we paid for it!! Next time, we will go someplace else.'
5,'had a great time in a great place.','On reaching the hotel after a long flight from the uk. We suddenly realised we had left our passports and all documents in the car that had dropped us off at the westin hotel. Obviously we were in a state of panic, the chances of getting them back we poor, but on talking to the hotel concierge and the manager they told us to calm down go to the bar have a drink (free) and wait for them to get back to us. Half an hour later they informed us all our documents and passports would be with us shortly, and so they were. They then upgraded our room for us and as a treat a big and deliciouse birthday cake was sent to our room with a really nice card for my wifes birthday. The hotel staff were polite and helpfull the room was spotless and the views were excellent, we ate in the bar which was good, we also ate at shula\'s resturaunt which was excellent, our only disappointment was that shula\'s was shut for labour day and that was our last evening and we did want to eat their again before we left. We would definately go there again and would recommend it to anyone. With a special thanks to the concierge Alexandra and the manager for their help and understanding.'
4,'Great Location','I was in New York for the NRF show and to spend some time visiting the sights. This hotel was the perfect location in Manhattan. The room was nice and updated but there were still touches of the hotel\'s age. The bathroom was a below par - it was like a freezer and the shower was either screaming hot or frosty cold. Based on the room and location of this hotel I would highly recommend this to anyone. The highlights were:\r\nLocation: It is a block from Penn station if you want to take the subway around Manhattan and is close enough to walk any of the north side attractions like Central Park or Times Square.\r\nSleep Quality: the beds were new and pretty comfortable and made for a great sleep. The blinds close tightly so you can black out the room. \r\nService: the staff was very helpful with all of our requests.'
4,'Great find','Have just returned from a stay at the Affinia Manhattan and was very pleasantly surprised. This hotel is perfect for a stay in New York if you are planning to go out rather than stay in the hotel.\r\nThe room was very large compared to most hotels in NY with the added benefit of a kitchen for making your own breakfast and snacks.\r\nPerfect location from Newark airport as a train goes directly to Penn station across the road in half an hour and costs a fraction of taxi costs.\r\nOnly downside is the traffic noise outside which might bother some although the beds are so comfortable we had no problem sleeping at all!\r\nWould definitely recommend.'
4,'Spectacular public rooms-- not so hot sleeping rooms','The Palmer House in Chicago is excellently located and has a grand and spectacular main floor, along with equally sumptious public rooms (dining, meeting, etc.). The service is also of the highest quality. But on the other hand this is an old hotel-- historic in fact-- and the liveability of the sleeping rooms reflects this. I have been here twice in the past ten days, and was given a room on the 18th floor and the 17th floor. The rooms are small, the bathrooms tiny, and the TVs old (definitely not flat screen). WWW connectivity in the rooms is problematic; I am literally in the hotel now, 17th floor, and it is OK; last week, however, was very spotty and slow reception. So, if you are staying in downtown Chicago this is a perfect location, and greeting guests in the lobby will overwhelm them with its opulence. But the sleeping rooms could be a lot better-- which, given the age of the property, is not really a criticism: it is simply a fact. (I would come here again, by the way, if I needed to be in this downtown area.)'
4,'Close to all the action!!','This hotel is 1/2 block from Time Square. We have a 5yo and a 10yo. We walked all around the city. We had a quad room which consist of 2 double beds, tv, dressing table, closet, chaise lounge and a bathroom. It\'s cool...you stick you head out the window and you see all the light and hussle and bussle of Time Square.\r\nThere is a restruant connected to the hotel but the waitress was very mean. We tried to make her laugh but it was like she tried not to be happy. She came to take our order and just walked away right in the middle as we were ordering. We asked her a question about the desserts...and she seemed almost offended! Comical actually.\r\nAnyhow, 2 night and 3 days was plenty of time to get the NYC experience.\r\nIt was very loud at night. We stayed on the 5th floor. If we go again next year, we are going to ask for something much higher. My 5yo had trouble sleeping because of the noise.\r\nOverall, I enjoyed it. The hotel price was reasonable and the location was absolutely fabulous! Would definetly recommend and stay again!'
3,'Posizione Ottima...Hotel da ristrutturare completamente!','Sono stato a New York dal 19 al 26 Febbraio 2012. Ho soggiornato in questo Hotel. Devo dire che la posizione è spettacolare. a 30 metri da Times Square (il centro di Manhattan) e non si può chiedere di meglio. Attorno ci sono molti ristoranti e negozi. Per la colazione (non inclusa) basta uscire dall\'hotel, sulla destra c\'è un negozio che vende sia dolci che cose salate, e naturalmente caffè, latte cioccolata calda. Evitate lo Starbucks, è molto più caro. La Hall non è niente male. Ben arredata. Il personale sembra molto scontroso. Diciamo che si vede che lavorano controvoglia (chissà perchè!). Ora passiamo alla nota dolente, le camere. A noi ci hanno dato una camera al 16° piano. Già la porta era molto vecchia e si chiudeva male. Anche per aprirla dovevi passare diverse volte il tesserino. La camera era piccolissima e credo mai ristrutturata dal 1960. Qualche filo che passa qua e la e bagno e moquette molto vecchia. Bagno piccolissimo. Qualche volta si dimenticavano di cambiarci gli asciugamani (basta avvisare la Hall te li portano subito). La notte ogni tanto si sentivano dei tubi sbattere violentemente credo a causa della pressione svegliandoci (come se qualcuno sbattesse violentemente contro il muro). Tracce di ristrutturazione (come dicono loro) non ne ho viste. Diciamo che sono uno che si adatta molto alle situazioni quindi non ho protestato ma credo che le stanze hanno molto bisogno di essere rifatte. Forse ci sono quelle messe meglio e altre messe peggio, questo non lo so. Comunque questo abbassa molto la valutazione. La posizione è da 5 stelle....le camere da 1. Quindi facendo la media gli do 3 nel giudizio.'
3,'Hotel in New York','Is not the best hotel, no luxuries, no WIFI in the bedroom, not fancy; BUT is not pricy at all, is in front of Penn Station (this is a GREAT advantage), is in a GREAT location (if u like more the lower side) you could walk from there to any place, and they clean bedrooms everyday. (my bedroom was always VERY clean)'
1,'Dirty and staff needs a seminar on friendliness.','Will never go again. I\'m embarrassed that I took my guests there.'
5,'Well located, excellant value, clean, friendly. Recommended','The hotel is ideally located just opposite Penn station for all site seeing. The room was clean & well equipt. We had a small kitchenette with hob, coffee machine, fridge & microwave. The staff were friendly, knowledgable and very approachable. We were travelling with a toddler, baby & teenager! We had a family suite which was more than adequate. The only down side was the fire station around the corner...emergencys happen at all times of days, however it did not cause any major problems and we would stay at the hotel again. Apart from that although it is quite a central location it was reasonably quiet there.'
3,'Durchschnittliches Hotel - super Lage','Direkt an der 7th Ave gelegen am gleichen Eck wie das berühmte Kaufhaus Macy\'s gelegen und in direkter Nachbarschaft vom Madison Square Garden befindet sich dieses schon ein bisschen in die Jahre gekommene Hotel.\r\nDa wir zu dritt unterwegs waren haben wir von Österreich aus gebuch und bei Ankunft ein Zimmer mit zwei Betten bekommen. Dies hieß für die anderen zwei leider, dass sie sich ein Bett teilen müssen.\r\nDie Zimmer waren schon ein bisschen in die Jahre gekommen, jedoch waren sie tip top sauber.\r\nUnd da wir nur zum schlafen dort waren und sonst fast nie, waren wir zufrieden damit.\r\nAuch vom vielen Strasenlärm hat man nicht viel mitbekommen bei geschlossenem Fenster, was aber dazu führte, dass es im Zimmer dann doch sehr heiss wurde.\r\nAls wir ein Mal die Türe nur eingehängt hatte um das Zimmer zu kühlen während der nachtg, klingelte das Telefon und die Security war dran, sie wollten uns warnen bzw. bitten dies nicht zu tun.\r\nPersonal war top in allen Fragen.\r\nUnd der größte Vorteil ist, es ist eben mitten in der City.'
4,'Great Stay in the Big Apple','What can I say...it\'s a Hilton and you know what to expect! The hotel is perfectly located to walk to Central Park, Radio City Music Hall, and Times Square! Hotel room was clean and comfortable.'
5,'Outstanding Service,','The hotel is very large and is connecting to central station. The location is outstanding. In walking distance to Times Square, 5th Avenue and so on... If you would like to receive outstanding service at the reception, ask for Blaine. She was a huge help and is very kind. She shows interest in all problems and tries to solve them as quickly as possible. The rooms are quite spacious and contain a plasma TV. The bathroom was on the smaller side. We took a clubroom. It\'s worth it. The Breakfast in the lounge was great and so was the dinner. The beds were very comfortable and quite large. I would recommend this hotel without second thoughts. We are deffinatly going to stay here again. Don\'t hesitate this is a great place and dont take any notice of the other bad reviews they are not correct.'
2,'Fantastic location not a great place to sleep','I had a six day trip in NYC and the hotel not great but not awful but for the location ten out of ten!!!! Hotel wise beds comfy and bathroom clean with a power shower so no complaints there!!! Although my sister and i commentated that the corridoors were like the corridoors from the film The Shining it really was not that bad!!! When you come to NYC you are here for the sights - not what your room is like!!! Within the area is great food outlets on the go 247 and at night plenty to pick and choose from!!!! I hope to come back and hopefully have a great time as i did from the first time round!!!'
4,'good hotel, excellent location!!','My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker at the beginning of May for 4 nights. \r\nWe booked the metro rooms, we read they were small and it was but served its purpose as we were only there to sleep at night. the room was very clean and comfortable. It has a flat screen TV, desk, small closet and small bathroom.\r\nThe service was good with fast and efficient check in and check out system. The staff at the information desk was very friendly and helpful. Although i didnt find conceierge so helpful as I was making an enquiry by phone and got transferred to them, the lady was very rude and put phone down on me, no bye no nothing. \r\nAs we were booked on a later flight back to UK, we left our luggage at the hotel. Be mindful that they charge you $1 to leave it there and $1 to collect it again, we only had 2 suitcases and \'m not sure if they charge more if oyu have more bags. I was not advised of this charge nor was there a sign but hey, that\'s the man\'s tip gone. \r\nThe hotel is very convenient, across the road from Madison Square Gardens (we had a room facing it), 2 blocks from Empire State Building, 1 block from Macy\'s and there is a metro station downstairs - Penn Station on 34th Street. There are 2 Penn stations so becarful when looking at the tube map. I\'m normally very good with directions and map reading but this underground system really threw me as the station platforms aren\'t very well signed posted. Just remember whether you want to travel uptown (towards Central Park / Harlem) or downtown (Financial district / Brooklyn) You can easily get to main tourist atttractions one these lines including Statue of Liberty, Central Park, America\'s Natural History Museum, Brookyln Bridge etc\r\nWe walked to most places as the hotel location was excellent. Times Sq is only 10 minutes walk away as it 5th avenue if you want to do some serious shopping. \r\nThe only downfall is the hotel does not offer breakfast as a package. However there is a 24hr tick tock diner at the hotel which most people went to. The service is friendly, good food but I found it rather expensive. There are some other cafes nearby. \r\nOverall it was an excellent choice and I would deifnately recommend this hotel.'
1,'Don\'t waste your $$$$$!!!!','My mother in-law booked this hotel through her travel agent for our honeymoon. When we got there the hotel looked more like a shopping mall. It was packed w/ people checking in and out. The carpet in the lobby was dirty and out dated. I could barely open the door to our room because it was so heavy and the handle was a piece of crap. The bathroom was dirty. There was urine dried up on the floor around the toilet. The bathtub was the smallest one I\'ve ever seen. There was no mirror in the room besides, behind the door in the closet. Not good for putting on make-up. The room was tiny and they didn\'t have anything you would expect in a hotel room such as a coffee pot or mini fridge. Room service was over priced!!!! And you had to pay for every outgoing phone call whether it was local or an 800 #. My mother in law said she paid $400.00 a night for this room for five nights, you would think these little things would be included. The walls are paper thin. I could here the woman in the next room having conversations on the phone and she left her TV on all night. I could here every word! I didn\'t sleep well. I could here the vaccume running in the room above us in the mornings. And of course being on our honeymoon we would have liked some privacy. We couldn\'t enjoy ourselves because we felt like everyone could here us. \r\n I read the negative reviews on here and just ignored them. I didn\'t think the Hyatt could be that bad, but it was. I don\'t recomend staying there.'
4,'Amazing staff & location','Alex at the front desk was amazing!! He got us checked in early, was funny and wonderful to speak to and gave us great suggestions on bars in the area. We were able to leave our luggage the next day as we walked around and when we returned, they got our luggage to us and hailed a cab within minutes. Everybody there was so friendly and accommodating. My only complaint was with the room itself - the temperature was far too hot and, even after turning off the thermostat, it never got cool. Oh, and the use of the lock on the door was strange - the housekeeping staff luckily came by as we were struggling and showed us how to do it. Friendly!!!! But the room itself in look and feel was really lovely, just wish the temp had been more comfortable.'
5,'Amazing hotel in the middle of time square','This is a bustling hotel. Its very huge and in the middle of time square so you\'re right there in the city. Its a beautiful hotel with a rotating restaurant in the top floor of the hotel. Be careful though, things can get really really expensive, although if you can afford to stay at this hotel without an employee discount (like we did) then you can probability afford some of the finer things. The elevators are pretty unique. You type in your floor on a key pad and it shows you which letter elevator to go to (A, B, C, etc) so that might be a more efficient system. Overall, very classy hotel. Not much value though. No free breakfast or internet or anything that you can find in smaller hotels, but hey, this is an executive hotel. Also I can\'t tell if there is a swimming pool. I don\'t think there is. There is definitely a fitness center though.'
4,'Very comfortable hotel in a great location','Stayed in this Marriott last week on a short break to New York, changed hotels at the last minute from another hotel when we realised the rooms here were much bigger. Hotel has a fabulous lobby with eight glass lifts going to the 45th floor, lots of fun to ride. King room was very large for NY standards and very comfortable bed. Floor to ceiling windows gave a great view of the city from the 44th Floor. The location of this hotel is fantastic - right in the middle of Times Square you walk out of the lobby and are at the centre of all the action. Sadly we missed out on a cocktail at The View rotating restaurant at the top of the hotel as we just ran out of time. Not the most luxurious hotel I\'ve ever stayed in but did the job perfectly and we would return.'
5,Super!!,'Ciao a tutti volevo dire la mia ... Sono rimasta soddisfatta ,l hotel era pulito ,il personale era attento e a disposizione per qualsiasi richiesta .. Inoltre c era Elizabet che parlava italiano ed e\' stata disponibilissima !!!! Siamo stati la settimana dopo l\' uragano ma nOn sembrava proprio era tutto nelle migliori condizioni . Grazie e ci rivedremo presto!!'
1,'My Truck Has a More Comfortable Bed!','Last week, 4/06/2005, I spent a night at The Palmer House Hotel in downtown Chicago. It is a nice old and elegant hotel when you are in the lobby or one of the restaurants. However, I was exhausted, arriving late at night for a job interview the next day, and really needed some decent food and sleep. My room was on the eigth floor, and I was first directed to the wrong set of elevators due to unclear instructions given at the front desk. When I did arrive at the correct elevator bank, I rode to the eighth floor, and found the signs to be utterly confusing. It took me fifteen minutes of wandering around to finally locate my room. (The next morning, I encountered another guest who complained bitterly, after a morning workout, that he could not relocate his room.) I entered the room, only to find that the air was stifling and hot. I also discovered the interior of the room could be viewed by those at the indoor swimming pool, as I was changing clothes and noticed movement. I went to eat at the Trader Vic restaurant in the complex, and was told, even though it was ten minutes before closing, that they would not serve any more meals. After finding an altrernative for dinner, I returned to a hot and musty room, despite the fact that I had left the AC running while I was out. After finally getting into bed, I discovered that the mattress sunk down to the level of the box spring, and that it was lopsided regardless of any efforts to get it to be level. Considering that this room was about $160.00 for the night (with taxes), and the reputation of Hilton Hotels, I would have expected much better than what I got. The bed of my truck is certainly more comfortable than their bed and I did not get much sleep thanks to their apparent unwillingness to replace old mattresses.'
5,'Marriott Marquis formidable a recommander','tres bien situe en plein centre Manhattan a Time Square ,, ideal pour sortir la nuit, theatres , cinemas, restaurants ouverts toute la nuit , magasins ouverts jusqu a2 heures du matin! Genial. \r\nHotel Marriott est spacieux, tres belles chambres et salle de bain, vue formidable. ne pas oublier de monter au top. restaurant tournant en 1 heure, vue super et buffet de petits fours!!! J y retourne dans 2 mois et me rejouis d avance'
3,'New Year at the Crowne Plaza','My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights over the New Year period.\r\nWe picked this hotel based on its location to Times Square.\r\nArrival\r\nDue to the snow, public transport wasn\'t running so we got a taxi from JFK to the hotel. It took about 30/40 minutes and cost $50 (without tip!)\r\nLocation\r\nThe location of the hotel is pretty much on Times Square and is next to the Hershey chocolate shop and opposite M&M World. A short walk to the nearest subway. \r\nHotel\r\nThe hotel itself was ok, tastefully decorated for Christmas. The front entrance leads to the shops, bars, etc. The back entrance is where you get taxis from.\r\nThe reception is up some escalators on the first floor along with the concierge desk, a bar and a restaurant. \r\nRoom\r\nWe were in room 1811 which was a corner room and had a view of Times Square to the right; it was a fairly decent size. There was a television, tea & coffee, ironing board, hair dryer and safe. There was an adequate amount of storage space. The room was tired in places, i.e. plug sockets hanging off walls. The bathroom was small and even more tired than the bedroom, there was the usual toiletries provided. The room had climate controls which were easy to use and efficient.\r\nFood & Drink\r\nWe didn\'t dine at the restaurant so I can\'t comment on that.\r\nWe did have a drink at the bar which was ok; they did mix up our drinks but sorted it out satisfactorily. \r\nStaff\r\nThe majority of the reception staff were pretty rude, if I\'m the only person standing at the reception queue and there\'s three staff behind the desk I do expect to be acknowledged even if they are doing something else. The phrase Hello sir, I will be with you shortly surely should be in the hotel staff handbook if not manners in general? We soon learnt not to ask the reception staff for any help. The concierge on the other hand were better, actually making an effort to look interested in the customer.\r\nThe maids went to the same staffing course as the reception staff I think. A couple of occasions we came back to our room about 4/5pm and the room wasn\'t ready! When we phoned to ask when it would be cleaned and a maid eventually turned up she looked at her watch and sighed. \r\nMiscellaneous\r\n- If you are going on the ferry to the statue of liberty definitely get there before 9am.\r\nWe got there as soon as they opened, joint the queue and before long the queue was massive. Also wrap up as it\'s right by the water and freezing.\r\nOverall\r\nThe view from the room for New Years Eve was why we chose this hotel and we weren\'t disappointed. The room could have done with a bit of attention but it was adequate and the bed was really comfortable. My main criticism is that most of the staff we met definitely needs to be sent away on a manners and customer service course.\r\nWe had a great time and the hotel is fine but if I came back to New York at a time other than New Year I wouldn\'t return to this hotel.'
3,'To everyone, their own.','Straight up you get what you pay for. Room is actually decent for a single bed room, aside from outdated bathroom, its still clean. We read reviews first, were very weary, checked the bed for bed bugs as soon as we came in, none of course. Idk if these otherpeople were expecting a hotel with a 5 star rating and gourmet restaurants, but its very clear this hotel is older and even if its to save money it embraces some of its history. Kinda cool. Were from vegas, use to excellent service and immaculate rooms, but I can\'t find a reason to say this place is nasty or horrible. I have bad asthma was scared after some reviews but nothing out of ordinary, the only negatives I can point out is the heat/ac is super old and probably doesn\'t work properly, and the walls seem thin at times. I didn\'t come to sit in my room so I don\'t mind. Bed is clean and comfy, water is hot, tv works, has iron etc. its an average room. Location is EXCELLENT. DO NOT pay to eat here, ridiculous, you can go to a number of places right outside for les then half. Pretty happy, I would come back just for the convenience and price. Only posted bc so many negatives and its really not horrible.'
1,'Worse hotel ever stayed in','Dirty and unkempt. Dust everywhere, air con broken (front falling off) and cracked toilet seat. \r\nDecieving from the outside and reception. \r\nBut central and easy access to everywhere either on foot or subway. \r\nWould we go back to that hotel - No.'
1,'Misleading and deceitful Concierge NYE 2010 / 2011','It\'s 1.30am here in times square 01/01/2011. Yes, we are here for NYE and to see the Ball drop. It\'s a big deal and a long trip from Sydney Australia. Arrived 1 and half days ago and asked the The Westin concierge  where is the best place to go to see the Ball drop? ... immediately we were offered about 5 restaurant options with exclusive access to the Ball drop in Times Square. whats the best? ...... Bond 45 came the reply its $275 plus tax, plus 20\% gratuity per head. Wow I thought .. expensive .. but hey you don\'t do this everyday ... you are sure we are going to see the Ball drop? .. absolutely, only an earthquake, terrorist attack or something similar will stop you and with the recommendation from the concierge and Ball drop view .. well .. that\'s what we came to see, overs I know ... well as we found out with so many other guests at the restaurant this evening, we were conned and mislead. The restaurant was OK but defiantly the staff gave no guarantees about seeing the ball drop .. there only comment from restaurant staff was we have a arrangement with the NYPD ???? The moment had arrived ... Times square was like Fort Knox and the only people gaining access were it seemed were Family members and friends of the 38,000 NYPD. We were blocked off like cattle with only badge flashing Police and there family and friends gaining access as we were all blocked off behind barricades in adjoining back streets, herded and squashed like corralled cattle. I am in room 2439 and going to bed nowcompletely disappointed after being so mislead and deceived by this Hotel. How can you believe any recommendation from them OR Trust and representations?'
2,'positiva solo la posizione','In effetti le altre recensioni sono chiare...\r\nquesto albergo vecchiotto e mal tenuto ha un forte pregio che è la posizione, e ne è consapevole. Ho notato che spesso è pieno, per cui probabilmente non ha interesse a rimodernare, ne tantomeno a pulire... è davvero sporco, ci si può dormire un paio di notti, ma io non ci tornerò mai più. Consiglio di perdere alcuni minuti a cercare un altro hotel nella zona, spendere 20 dollari in più, ma questo hotel non è da consigliare.\r\nConcludendo, mi soffermo invece sulla zona, che può essere più utile rispetto ai dettagli della sporcizia (!): l\'hotel si trova a due passi dalle linee 1,2,3, dalle A,C,E, dalla Penn Station, per cui se si arriva dall\'aeroporto, e qualsiasi mezzo si voglia prendere, è veramente comodo. \r\nInoltre, anche la sera, è talmente in pieno centro che in 5/10 minuti di camminata si raggiunge Time Square senza pericoli e senza problemi. \r\nPer cui 10 alla zona e 1 all\'hotel...'
4,'Pleasantly Surprised','I stayed at this property years ago and was not impressed with the rooms or the impersonal feel of this huge hotel. I stayed one night last week on business and I must say they have done a great job updating the rooms and have managed to deliver terrific personal service - front desk check-in, concierge, doorman - no easy feat in a hotel of this size. Room service was prompt and my phone calls were address in a friendly, courteous and efficient manner. This Hilton is situated in a good location if you want to be in mid-town. I would not hesitate to stay here again.'
3,'Se podía esperar mas','La estadía fue cómo si solo lo quieres para pasar la noche. Las habitaciones y en especial el baño dejaron mucho que esperar en cuanto aseo. El hotel se encuentra bien ubicado y creo que es lo mejor que puede ofrecer. El área del lobby podría mejorarse y no sólo colocar letraros de prohibición para el público respecto a algunas áreas. La comunicación del front desk estuvo a la altura.'
4,'Spacious rooms, great staff, comfy beds','Two colleagues and I stayed at the Palmer House for four nights during a convention we were attending. The hotel is beautiful and is an excellent location right near the L. There are great places to eat within walking distance and a CVS right across the street. Our room was very spacious and had two bathrooms, which was a big plus. Overall, the staff was very friendly and helpful, although one waiter in the lobby restaurant/bar was a bit rude. The city is clean and I always felt very safe. I would definitely stay here again!'
5,'Fantastic Location!','Location, Location, Location!!! As other reviewers have said, this Hotel is in the perfect spot along the Avenue of the Americas. We arrived an hour before check in (on a Thursday) and got a room right away. I was pleasantly surprised, we had a corner room and the nicest view I have ever had in NYC. We booked a regular room with 2 beds and that\'s exactly what we got. Nicely decorated with a flat screen TV. The bathroom was on the small side, but had plenty a room for all of our toiletries, make up etc. The only thing that annoyed me was the toilet, to flush you had to bend down and reach your hand under the sink, it was a strange. But for the $$ it was perfect! We booked through the Hilton website and paid $299 and $259 for a Thurs/Fri stay, worth every penny. We checked into going back @ x-mas time and the price is double so not sure if we will be going back that time, but if the price was the same I would book there every time!\r\nMy friend and I were in NYC to celebrate our B-days, here are some recommendations...\r\nWe took the Sex and the City bus tour $45 a ticket and you have to make a reservation in advance, very fun! The tour makes a few stops and you get a free cupcake!\r\nWe also went to dinner @ Les Halles 414 Park Ave S, they have $19.99 Steak Frittes (steak and fries) every day! Steak was cooked perfectly, dessert was great too.\r\nWe had dinner @ Serendipity, and I would never go back again! Frozen Hot chocolate was good, but the food was not worth it. \r\nAlso check out Dylan\'s Candy Store... 3 floors of candy, who can resist that!\r\nHope this helps you to have a great trip to NYC!'
4,'very nice place to stay','The southgate tower hotel was wonderful. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean and because of a mix up (which we got refunded for) we got a chance to see 2 different types of room. The first was a \'guestroom\'. VERY small..basically only a bed, a window, a bathroom and a long useless hallway. Still, with the size it was, the sheets were good quality, it smelled nice and it was bareable.. the second night, we got our queen bed suite. For the money, we could not believe how nice this room was for a NYC hotel! It was beautiful, with a full kitchen, microwave, toaster oven, and plenty of room to just relax. Very impressed and would definitely stay here again!'
4,'great stay at the westin','Rooms were exactly as pictured. Fairly spacious for NYC, love that all rooms in the hotel are non-smoking.\r\nWas on a high floor but no view. \r\nBeds were heavenly with down filled pillows and comforter. \r\nWould recommend this property and would stay here again.'
2,'Renovation City - stay here if you like noise','I recently stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for a short business trip. They are renovating this hotel and there is noise everywhere. The elevators in the lobby were being worked on so you had to lug your luggage up 2 flights of stairs. What a nice way to arrive! I moved rooms twice because the noise was either in the walls from the electrical or plumbing, or the banging of construction starting at 8:00am on a saturday morning or outside your window from the train next to the hotel. Every room is a different size - some are like closets and some are huge - very inconsistent. I would recommend staying in more modern hotel instead of this old over the top hotel.'
3,'Excelent location for shopping','We\'ve got a promotion (100 dolars for a quadruple room, which means 25 dolars/person/night) and for midtown Mannhathan it was a excelent value. Let\'s begin with the Location: In the middle of everything. Walking distance from Times Square, Broadway and next to the Empire State Building. Excelent for those who are traveling for shopping as Victoria Secret, B&H and Macy\'s are few walking distance. You can get a taxi in front of the hotel anytime, for example I had to take a cab to the airport at 4 a.m and there were a queue of them in the avenue in front of the hotel. About the Rooms: Outdated. No problem with the bed and the shower. They were reasonably clean, slightly worn, but for those who do not care about frills and want a hotel just as a base to sleep, the hotel is more than OK. About the hotel: The staff were busy but friendly. In the summer sometimes people make a queue in the lobby to checkin/checkout.'
1,'Do not recommend','I had a renovated room booked at the Crowne Plaza but when I got in the room is was clearly not renovated. The room was dirty, the linens were of poor quality and the bathroom was small, stained, and old. I called the front desk thinking there had been a mistake but the receptionist told me that I was in a renovated room. At that point I called my travel agent and for the first time ever (and I travel atleast a few times a month for business) decided to check out the hotel and stay in another hotel. (My travel agaent booked me another room at the Hilton in Times Square, which I highly recommend). \r\nWhen I went down to the front desk and told the manager that I would like to check out because I was unhappy with the room they still charged me the cancellation fee. Overall the manager and staff were rude and inflexible. In fact, there were 2 other people arguing with the manager when I walked in the lobby. I would not recommend this hotel at all. There are many nicer hotels for the same price (the Hilton is much nicer and even cheaper).'
3,'Muy bien situado','Hotel muy bien situado, en un edificio histórico. El lobby y el bar geniales. Pero la cama minúscula, y wifi gratuito solo en el lobby. El servicio muy amable, tanto en el bar del lobby como los conserjes en la puerta.'
3,'Great location, small but comfertable rooms','We stayed at the New Yorker at the start of our east-coast trip to Miami. It was our second stay at the hotel and the location can\'t be beaten. It is located on W 34th st and 8 ave. across the street from Madison square garden. It lies next to Penn station, making it very accessible from the major airports and is perfect for visiting the major sites. Time square lies on walking distance (10-15 minutes). Although the rooms are very small its in consensus with the average NY hotel. Good price-quality relationship with clean rooms but mediocre bathroom.'
1,'A Hotel out of 1984 - A truly hellish experience.','I am a very avid world traveller who has been to over 40 countries, and I have literally stayed at every type of hotel around the world and I can honestly say I have never had such a hellish hotel experience in my life. My experience is as follows:\r\n- Arrived at Pennsylvania Hotel at 11 PM tired from a long drive\r\n- Waited 45 min in checkout line\r\n- Once I got a receptionist, she told me that she didn\'t have my reservation from priceline so I ended up waiting another 20 minutes until her manager supposedly sorted everything else. The woman working at the desk must have been either borderline mentally handicapped, on drugs or extremely overworked because she kept asking me for my ID or credit card when it was already on her desk.\r\n- Finally get to one of the most disgusting hotel rooms I have ever seen. One of those places where you are afraid of catching herpes just sleeping on the bed\r\n- When I got back home, I noticed an email from priceline that I had apparently never shown up to the Hotel but that I would be charged because I didn\'t notify early enough. That was strange considering that I HAD stayed at the hotel.\r\n- Then I noticed TWO charges from the hotel!! I had only stayed one night but they had double-charged me\r\n- I called the hotel and finally got to a person. That person asked me if I knew a Sandra...something. When I said I didn\'t, I was treated like an idiot. When she told me that a Sandra had booked a room online but paid with my card, my heart sunk\r\n- I told the woman that the receptionist was incompetent and likely made a mistake\r\n- Then this was the response she gave me Umm no, we didn\'t make a mistake.\r\n- I finally hung up after she refused to refund me and called my bank to dispute the charge\r\nIn conclusion: DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL NO MATTER HOW POOR YOU ARE. YOU ARE BETTER OFF AT A FLOPHOUSE OR AIRPORT HOTEL THAN THIS PLACE DESPITE ITS LOCATION IN THE HEART OF TOWN!!! I mean this hotel has more terrible ratings than any other ratings.'
3,'Muy buena ubicacion','HOtel pupular , muy buena ubicacion , en relacion con el precio el servicio es bueno, muchisimas habitaciones y mucha gente entrando y saliendo , no esperes lujo ni servicios. LOs empleados toman el check in \' out y nada mas , pero en su entrada tienen cafe, servicio de turismo , venta de recuerditos , internet con pc, etc'
1,'A Long Time HiltonHonors Member - Never Stay at Hilton NY Again','Just returned from NYC on an Easter Weekend with the family to catch a show on Broadway. I am a long time, loyal HiltonHonors guest and this trip with the family was with 50,000 Honors pts earned over the past year. I chose this Hilton over the other Hilton Properties near Time Square (Doubletree, Hilton Time Square, and the Hampton Inn) mainly because of Nostalgia. When I was to work in Manhattan I used to stay at this hotel regularly when it was Hilton Rockfeller Plaza. Sadly, the Hilton NY isn\'t what it used to be - both in the rooms and the particularly this time around the service. I will NEVER return to this Hilton again when I visit NY for both personal and work trips.\r\nThis I would have to say is the single worst experience I\'ve had with any hotel as I was treated as a criminal (actually got the hotel security involved) by the overly obnoxious Bell Captain and the hotel security guard when I attempted to retrieve my belongings from one of his carts without his authorization (even though I had asked the front desk and they said it was perfectly fine). To keep it short, I did not appreciate being treated this way by a HOTEL I WAS STAYING at and it escalated into discussions with the front desk and manager on duty. To be fair, they were at least professional and accomadating and made every attempt to recover (including refunding my honors points).\r\nSadly, though that really wasn\'t nearly enough to get over the fact that I was treated as a thug by one of hotels staff. And I probably would not have noticed the dingy, fraying carpet on the 17th floor, the lack of bottled water (which is provided to Honors members of status), the lukewarm water, and slow running toilets. To again be fair, I was told by the manager that I would be upgraded to the 13th floor which has been renovated and much nicer.\r\nMaybe it was a just a bad night for the Bell Captain and the staff (it was extremely busy) but I cannot stop thinking that this was definitely NOT the great Hilton Rockefeller Plaza. Just another run down hotel with rude staff. There certainly plenty of these I could go before this one.'
3,'You get what you pay.','You get what you pay. Simple rooms, old furniture, no room service. But the location is more than excelent to get to know NYC.\r\nDon\'t expect the best service ever... Acctually it is a huge hotel, with many people from all over the world, getting in and out all the time. So the attendants aren\'t that helpfull. \r\nBut - again - the location is just the best if you\'re going to NYC for the first time. Many stores around, as well as subways lines really close.'
4,'Times Square Gem','I know what some folks say about the age of the Edison, but this hotel has many more positives than negatives. Two friends and I stayed for a week in May and were delighted with our accommodations. Our room was gigantic by NYC standards. We had a combo suite with two bedrooms, a sitting area and a nice bathroom. The beds were comfy, the rooms were immaculate, we had two big closets and two flat screen TV\'s. The room was bright, with large windows overlooking 47th street. The Edison has the perfect location just steps from Times Square, so the lobby is very busy, but the visible security made us feel safe. You can\'t beat the cafe just off the lobby for a good, well priced breakfast. And the staff is cheerful and friendly.'
4,'First Time To New York from UK Visitor','We stayed at the westin for 4 nights over Memorial Day weekend. We did have a low level floor and asked to be moved cos out of the window all we could see was top half of lower end of building, but hotel was full so nothing available - that said did\'nt really matter cos we were hardly there enjoying the sites and sounds of magnificent New York.\r\nBAD\r\nSome dodgy sex shops around the back of hotel - was slightly worrying walking past late at night.\r\nSome parts of room were not totally clean but hey these hotels are going to be used loads !\r\nYou have to pay for N64 games machine within the TV (Bummer)! ! !\r\nGOOD\r\nBrilliant location. We got a bus from Newark Ariport to Port Authority and walked the 25 metres to hotel without any problem !\r\nStarbucks coffee in room every day\r\nClean sheets and towels every day\r\nWe ate breakfast at local cafe\'s within easy walking distance.\r\nKept our cases for free whilst we spent our last day doing sites.\r\nREALLY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR TOURISTS AS FAB LOCATION & MORE THAN ADEQUATE FACILITIES'
5,'Great neighborhood, friendly staff, gorgeous room.','My fiance and I spent 5 nights at the Palmer House Hilton this past June and really enjoyed it. Chicago has a reputation for being a friendly town and the Palmer House was no exception. Everyone on the staff from the concierge through the maid service was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We had booked a special romance package deal and requested non-alcoholic sparkling beverage. When we arrived we found real champagne, when we called downstairs the staff sent the non-alcoholic bottle up immediately and were really apologetic about the mistake. \r\nThe meals we ate at the hotel were all very good for room service dining and I have to mention the fitness center which was REALLY amazing. A fantastic facility which I used every day. \r\nThe location of the hotel was perfect as well, right by a subway stop so that we were very easily able to get out to the suburbs to visit family and friends. Additionally we could very easily walk to the Art Institute and the Millennium Park. We really enjoyed this hotel and the lobby/decor was exceptional!\r\nIf I really reach, I suppose I could say that the view from our window was pretty dismal (we had a side room) if you care about things like that I would request a room at the front of the hotel perhaps. For us it wasn\'t really a problem, but again, if you are into the view you would need to let them know. Since we are going to be back and forth in Chicago fairly frequently after the wedding I suspect we will be seeing a lot of the Palmer House.'
2,'Don\'t Park Yourself at the Park Central','I stayed at the Park Central one night on a recent business trip to NYC.The stay was between mediocre and miserable.First the lobby was dark,seedy and the furniture was worn and dirty.The front office staff was courteous as was the bellman.The elevator was dirty and noisy.My room was good sized but only had a desk chair.The lighting the room was poor and the television was an older model.The bright spot was the bathroom which had been recently renovated with new fixtures.The heating unit was extremely loud and old.\r\nIn summary I would recommend those looking for a more updated hotel look elsewhere.The location is good, staff is friendly but that is where it stops'
5,'Beautiful Hotel','The hotel lobby is primarily the reason why I stay at this hotel. The rooms are great, comfortable, and affordable, however, I enjoy waking up in the morning and walking down to this lobby. The same applies in the evening. I have never had a bad experience at this hotel as I am a frequent guest.'
5,'Excellent location great Staff!','I was in New York when hurricane Sandy arrived. I was staying in a Marriott at the financial district and we were evacuated to the Marriott Marquis. I have to say the location cannot be better than this! walking out of the hotel and being in the middle of Times Square is absolutly wonderful. Clean, great views, great rooms nothing negative to say.\r\nDuring our stay we had a wonderful experience with a young lady at the front desk her name is Stephanie S and I hope she gets recognized for her wonderful service. In our stay it was my husband another couple and myself, and while we were there anything we needed or any question we had Stephanie always answered with a smile, she was amazing and I appreciate the help she gave us at that time of uncertainty not knowing when we could go back home, worried about having a room until the airport would open again.\r\nThanks Stephanie! I hope this review is mentioned to you! :)'
3,'Fantastic location','Location of the hotel was fantastic, a couple of minutes from Macy\'s, diagonally opposite Madison Square Gardens and within easy walking distance of both Times Square and the Empire State Building. We had a corner room which meant that the view was straight down 7th Avenue and Times Square with all the lights and glitz. Traffic noise was not great though with the local fire station in the same block and the expected honking of horns 24/7. having said that, it is to be expected and my kids, the wife and I were so shattered by the end of each day, we slept through most of it.\r\nThe view from the window more than made up for all of it.\r\nThe hotel staff were so-so, not as cheery or welcoming as concierges around Europe but again that is a New Yorker trait? We found the same grouchy demeanour from most New Yorkers in the shops ranging from disinterest to rude (particularly if you gave any impression of not wanting to buy).\r\nBut New York is an amazing place and one I will visit again for certain - it is so buzzing and even in the 9 days we were there, there was so much I still wanted to do (but the kids were too young). The location of the hotel was perfect for us also and we would not hesitate to return despite the luke-warm reception.'
2,'Budget Standard','I stayed at the New York Hilton from 21-08-04 to 26-08-04. This was my my first stay at the Hilton. I visit New York on a regular basis and thought I\'d give the Hilton a try this time mainly because of the brand name.\r\nWhen I got to the hotel my double room wasn\'t available, so I was put in a small room which I didn\'t want. I asked to be upgraded to a suite, but they wouldn\'t give me one, even though I was willing to pay a considerable difference.\r\nThe paper was peeling off the walls, and the paint was peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom. The loo didn\'t flush properly, and the bath took a life time to drain away.\r\nThe view from my window was ghastly (the back of the Sheraton), and the hotel wasn\'t as nicely lit up at night as the brochures would have you believe.\r\nBreakfast was like a rugby scrum, and the (breakfast) menu was mainly geared towards Japanese tourists.\r\n(Be warned ...Breakfast is extra. It is not included with the price of the room. Eat elsewhere. There is a perfectly good and far less costly 24 hour diner on the corner of the block)\r\nAvoid using the hotel restuarant in the evening. The selection/choice of food on the evening menu is extremely poor and limited.\r\nIf you\'re into shopping and sightseeing, chose a hotel nearer Times Square because this particular Hilton is a \'bit of a long treck\' from all the action.\r\nMy biggest concern is security ...There is NO security! Anyone can come and go without question!\r\nApart from the above, I found the staff to be pleasant, and the bed was clean and comfy.\r\nAll in all, I was disappointed that such a brand name provided budget standard accomodation.'
2,'Bare Bones at Boutique Prices!','The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms were so small I felt like I was back in a college dormitory. The bed sat on the floor (not making it easy to get up); it was noisy from rooms upstairs. For a boutique hotel, no amenities - which would make it nicer - no robes, crappy towels (and you only get two), no turn down service, no water, minibar, mints, no down featherbeds, comforters, etc., etc., etc. Certainly not what I am used to. The heat didn\'t work in the room for 3 days with promises to fix, it took two days to get an extra blanket and 2 days for extra towels and then they were taken away (we were there 5 nights). Everything in the hallways is dark and bad lighting - think they are trying to mask the fact that it really was a college dormitory. When we checked in we were told the rooms weren\'t really designed to hang around in them. The only good quality about this place is a good location. Not a single drop of communication from the hotel during our entire stay!'
2,'Do not stay here!!!!','Below is a letter I sent to the hotel after our stay 1/29/11. Please see below. \r\nTo Whom It May Concern,\r\nI just wanted to let you know how dissappointed we were with our stay at your hotel on the above listed day. The frontdoor men were fine and the check in went without flaw but the room that was listed as a combo suite was falsely advertised. We booked this hotel based on the description and the picture on the website. It stated that this was a combo suite that was roomy and the picture is of a beautiful room with nice furnture. This was for our friends 50th birthday celebration and it was our idea to stay at this hotel due to the locaton and a past experience at this hotel . You can imagine my embarrassment when we opened the door to the suite to find a very small 2 rooms with old banged up furniture, mismatched lamps, chairs that were so low to the floor and cheap that it was almost impossible to get out of them without dislocating your knee caps once you were seated. The beds didnot have a bedspread on them and the rooms were stuffy. This room looked nothing like the picture and was nothing like the descrption on your website. It also was horrible having to go through ours friends bedroom in the middle of the night just to go to the bathroom! You can also imagine how babdly we felt when I heard our friend say to her husband \' Its ok as it is only for one night and we will not be in the room much! Since we thought we would come back and have a few drinks and relax in our suite this went out the window. We tried to make the best of it but my friends actually had to sit on the floor to get comfortable. Really? Really? \r\nI thought based on the description from the website that the $250.00 that was paid for this room was very reasonable but having stayed there you are grossly overcharging people and misleading them to belief they are getting something they are not. You should truely be ashamed of yourselfs. I don\'t care about the location and the next time we stay in the city we will stay at the Hampton in. The location may not be quite as good but the rooms are great and I know what we are getting. \r\nI will be posting a review on expedia to advise people of our experience and warn them about the misleading representation of your website.'
5,'Finalmente la soluzione ottimale per una famiglia di 5 persone','Ho prenotato una stanza per 5 persone, a luglio, per 5 giorni e, francamente, prima di entrare nella stanza ero preoccupato, dal momento che tutte le soluzioni che vengono vendute si rivelano sempre piuttosto sacrificate. E\' in pratica un mini appartamento con due stanze, di cui una con due letti da 1 piazza e mezza e l\'altra con un grande divano letto matrimoniale; un angolo cottura fornitissimo con un grande frigorifero, e addirittura due bagni. Stanza elegante, confortevole e sopratutto senza la ben che minima inefficienza. Sempre pulita e rifornita in maniera adeguata al numero degli occupanti. Che dire poi della posizione; è baricentrica tra Central Park e Battery Park. Di fronte alla Stazione Penn (che collega tutte le proncipali linee ferroviarie, compresa quella per l\'aeroporto di Newark, e tutte le metropolitane), e al Medison Square Garden; a pochi metri da Macys e a non meno di 200 mt da Time Square e l\'Empire State Building. Sotto l\'Hotel un\'infinità di soluzioni per mangiare, dal fast food al ristorante al supermercato. Insomma l\'ideale per visitare New York contemperando le esigenze di una grossa famiglia con la possibilità di fare anche tardi la sera, senza rinunciare a gustarsi le luci della città il cui fascino è assolutamente unico. Andateci.'
4,'Great Location','Okay. The Edison is an old hotel and the rooms show this. But where else are you going to get a very clean, comfortable, safe hotel right at Times Square for this price during the Christmas season?When we first checked in and saw our room, I was doubtful. The room was very small and the bathroom smaller. Closet was very good size. We didn\'t plan on staying in our room except to sleep when we had Times Square right out the front door and Macy\'s, Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, Broadway and every type of restaurant you can imagine within easy walking distance. I ended up loving the Edison.The beds were very comfortable and the room was spotless.The lobby is very nice and decorated beautifully for Christmas. We had to show our room key to the ever present security guard to enter the elevators which made me feel very safe. We will certainly stay here anytime we go to New York City. I highly recommend it. If you want the latest decor and a huge room - go pay for it elsewhere.'
5,'Great Location - Room with good views is 4302','We travelled with friends to New York for Christmas shopping and stayed at this hotel. We had rooms (King Bed Deluxe) on one of the club floors (43-46). My wife are loyality club members and automatically qualified for rooms on this floor. We both had lovely rooms, however our friends were in 4302 (a corner room) which afforded them fantastic views of Times Square and the Hudson River. The views from our room were not as good. My wife and I are Intercontinental Hotels loyality club members and therefore qualified for the rooms on these level automatically (I think). The club levels gives you access to a lounge on the 44 th floor where you get a free continental breakfast, and soft drinks early evening. I thought the hotel was fantastic because of where itis. To be in Times Square with the theatres etc being so close is just unbelievable. The Metro is close and a number of the tourist sites are within walking distance.\r\nAREAS of CAUTION\r\nROOMS - I have read a number of the reviews re rooms - our rooms were great, no complaints, however a friend has stayed at the hotel and was given a poor room. I think it is a case of you get what you pay. At the time we visited the rate was around $500 (that was reduced as well). Someone has written a review saying they got a room vis Priceline for $200 at the same time, but it was old, in need of decoration, small etc etc - as I have said you get what you paid forpay for w and small nn reviewed, and therefo. CONCIERGE - The concierge at the hotel is out sourced and though very helpful is very very expensive - I had theatre tickets but it was quite apparent that they were charging over the top for theatre tickets. The airport car service arrived on time but again was very expensive - there are always yellow cabs outside the hotel. \r\nBILL - Check your bill via the television - we had a charge which took three calls or visits to get it removed.\r\nI do think this is a good hotel, its near the action and I would stay again'
5,'Great Location in a Great City','Brilliant hotel, great location you literally on top of Grand Central Station, If you have been to New York before then you will know how good that is. If not stay here, we stayed in July with great weather so walking was great. Taxis are just a rip off, get the tube to the airport if you have small bags for a few nights. The hotel was really clean, massive and great for a visit to New York'
5,'Fantastic location','Stayed at the Grand Hyatt week of Oct. 12, 2009. Beautiful Hotel, friendly staff, comfortable beds, excellent location. The location made our trip so much easier to get\r\naround and see the sights. Loved that Grand Central Terminal is connected and that\r\nwe could go to the food court anytime to get reasonably priced meals, try Junior\'s\r\nrestaurant to get great cheesecake and sandwiches. Would stay at the Grand Hyatt\r\nagain.'
4,'bon rapport qualité prix emplacement','l\'hotel était très bien situé, l\'appartement était suffisant grand pour 4 personnes, en revanche, problème d\'isolation à revoir, l\'air froid s\'engouffre sous les fenêtres, il faudrait avoir un vrai 2ème lit car le canapé convertible est limite pour 2 grands ados.\r\nEviter le shuttle de l\'hotel, une catastrophe, nous avons attendu plus d\'une heure à l\'entrée de l\'hotel avec le stress d\'arriver à JFK trop tard, bon OK c\'était la neige qui avait perturbé la circulation, mais personne nous a dit de prendre le shuttle plus tot (16h pour décollage 21h c\'était normalement bon mais le shuttle est arrivé à 17h15 !!!). Le reste, rien à dire tout était très bien, l\'accueil, le check in, le check out....et l\'hotel est en face du madison square garden et à coté de Macy\'s.'
4,'Not Bad!','I got there early at 10:30am and my room was ready. The front desk staff were very friendly and eager to impress. The room was large and if you get a top floor I am sure it has a great view. I was on 19 and the view was not terrific. It is in a great location; a block away from port authority and a block from all of times squares festivities! The show Rent is one street away! The room was clean (I base it on hair found in the tub) but there was some dust in the corners. Bed was comfy and th AC worked well. I would definately stay in this hotel again. Only negative were the bell men. They actually told us to go into the storage and grab our own bag. Granted we did have tickets but it does leave the chance of baggage being stolen. \r\nI was expecting awful stuff after reading these reviews so I must say that I was pleasently surprised.'
4,'Mitten im Gewühl Timesquare','Wer New York nur in ein paar wenigen Tagen mitten im Gewühl erleben möchte ist hier genau richtig. Das pulsierende Leben steht nie still und zum Fenster raus schauen ist auf jeden Fall besser als Fernsehen. Immer noch ein Erlebnis ist die Liftfahrt in den Glaskabinen, die durch das Atrium sausen und auch nach 20 Jahren noch staunen lassen. Manhatten lässt sich von da aus prima mit der U Bahn erkunden, Musicals in Fussdistanz. Die Bar ganz oben ist immer noch ein Muss!'
1,'You will regret booking this hostel.','My family came to New York so excited, only to be completely let down before our trip even started.\r\nDon\'t be fooled by the marketing or website photos.\r\nRooms- I have stayed in multiple hostels and dormitories with larger and cleaner facilities. Honestly, unless you are 2 feet tall, your body will barely fit in the entire room. My husband had to use the lobby bathroom that thousands of people use, as he could not sit down on the toilet without his legs painfully pushing into the door. The see-through shower is right next to the bed and there\'s nowhere else to go (a few inches of space on either side of the bed and that\'s it) which is awkward. We asked to move to a larger room- a rude staff member said they were sold out, and that if a larger room was available, it would be many hundreds of dollars more a night, and basically discouraged me. Believe me when I say stay away! \r\nThey also told me Hudson had a complete renovation. When I asked where, they told me the beds were lifted so you can place a suitcase underneath (how thoughtful), and that the lighting was changed. This is a major renovation???\r\nThe lobby and bars are hip and fun, yes, but any joe schmo off the street can experience these outlets.\r\nMy advice- look at the photos guests post and compare square footage to other hotels. The hotel isn\'t a focal point of a trip to NYC, but also shouldn\'t ruin your vacation.'
3,'Just the job','Right in the centre of it all. It\'s old, yes. It could certainly do with an update. But, for the price you couldn\'t get upset. Directly facing Maddison Square Garden, it\'s a short walk to all Manhatten has to offer. Room was cleaned every day, clean towels left every day and it was so busy all the people can\'t have got it wrong. Staff at the front desk could have been more ameniable, but done their job and that\'s the only critisism I could make.\r\nWill definately stay there again, providing they don\'t hike the prices.'
5,Unforgettable,'The trip to NYC was a surprise that I learned of about 3 hrs before leaving. Although I had been to New York before I obviously had nothing planned and no expectations. Choosing The New Yorker was the first sign that I knew the trip was going to be special. Its a historic, beautiful building centrally located. The lobby was preserved to its original beauty and was the most impressive, as the rooms are very small (but thats to be expected for a hotel built so long ago in Manhattan). I actually don\'t mind the small room- it was cozy and clean and had the original charm of the era. Like everything in NY, its expensive and thats the main drawback. The TickTock (? I think thats whats its called) cafe was excellent for breakfast and always seemed to be busy. \r\nEverything about the surprise trip was perfect and reflected my likes- shopping, the hotel, the sites we saw, amazing food at the best restaurants, a gorgeous ring and a wonderful man!'
5,'Favorite NYC hotel','The Edison is always reliably clean, comfortable and affordable - an amazing thing for such a great location in Midtown. I\'ve stayed at the Edison around 10 times and it never disappoints. The staff is always welcoming and professional, and the place has great character and history. The cafe is legendary and one of the very few remaining spots of its kind left in Times Square (the faded poster in the window is from a real Neil Simon play that recreated the cafe as the set for the Broadway stage). Many, many Broadway cast recordings have been recorded in the Edison\'s studio. The restaurant Sophia is a great old-style piano bar, and the Rum House is a terrific intimate bar by the elevators where I\'ve spent memorable late nights with friends and new acquaintances. Those who prefer fancier rooms aren\'t taking full advantage of being in New York; the most important features for a room in New York are a good bed and a bathroom, and those are covered here. And even during the height of the City\'s bed bug epidemic which affected everyone, I never encountered a single one at the Edison.\r\nI have a lot of affection for this place and its Deco style - especially as I\'ve watched all the great (and some less great) spaces around it mowed down for new construction. If some rooms are outdated, they are probably soon to be renovated, since that work seems on a continuous cycle. Personally, I\'ve been completely happy to be at the Edison every time.'
5,'Loved it!!!!','My boyfriend and I just spend 5 nights at the Affinia Manhattan. We were more than pleased with the service we received. Our flight was delayed and we didn\'t end up getting to the hotel to check in until 1am. Todd checked us in and was very kind and friendly and even recommended a great pizza place (even gave us a menu to take to the room, which was nice). I had put in a request for a room with a terrace or view, since it was our first time to NYC. We got room 2109, which is a corner room on the 21st floor. It had a great view of Madison Square Garden. I had also been in email contact with Maureen, a concierge, to have a cheesecake delivered for my boyfriend\'s birthday. I was so pleased to see a \'Happy Birthday\' banner with balloons on the wall of our room! I had no idea that would be up, it was great. Maureen also came through with the cheesecake. We were out and about when it arrived, and they placed it in the fridge. It was perfect, exactly what I wanted and quite delicious. Maureen (and the other concierges) were very helpful when it came to subway, Broadway and other questions. They must have caller ID, because they always knew I was calling, which I enjoyed. The room itself was very clean, the bed was very, VERY comfortable, and having a kitchen was really convenient. The bathroom was small, but not unbearably so. The Aveda amenities were a nice touch. The location of the hotel is also noteworthy: a block away from the subway. Everywhere we wanted to go was one or two subway stops from Penn Station (which is across the street).\r\nI can\'t say enough nice things about the Affinia Manhattan. I chose this hotel based on the reviews here and am happy to report that the reviews are correct- this is a great hotel. I will definitely stay there for any visit to NYC that I make in the future.'
5,'AMAZING HOTEL','This is the perfect hotel when you go to New York City. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Upon arrival they take your bags and make you feel at home. That\'s a pretty nice feeling when your in New York City. Check in was a dream. They certainly try to accommodate you! The room was on the 43rd floor. A view of the cruise ships and Hudson River. Gorgeous! Also, It was very quiet. Sleeping was no problem. The rooms were spotless. We were close to many good restaurants like Smith\'s across the street. Great food and very well priced. One of the best things we did was buy the pass from City Tours. It\'s and on and off bus service which was wonderful. All the sites wihere with a guide on board. This is certainly worth the money. The sales people are everywhere in Time Square. We bought the $85.00 package and it was great. I would definitely book the Westin Time Square again.'
2,'All the Glitz But None of the Glory','This has one of the most beautiful entryways and lobbies I have ever seen. Unfortunately, you do not get to sleep in the lobby. The accomodations are the smallest tiniest rooms I have ever stayed in that did not have wheels on the bottom. The closet door will only open part way because it hits the bed. The bathroom has no shelf space to place your toiletries. There is only one chair in the room, and not really much space for that. Yikes! - were people really tiny in the 1930s when this place was built? The staff is cordial and polite. The place is kept clean and tidy. \r\n The elevators are extremely slow. Admittedly, the hotel was fully booked on the nights of my stay, but my wait time to get an elevator averaged 17 minutes, and the longest wait was more than 25 minutes. \r\nHere is the problem: the room rates are outrageously high for the size of the rooms and the general accomodations. Unless you derive great pleasure from looking at neo-classical art and art-nuevo architecture, you do not get a decent value here.'
5,'Loved this hotel','We loved the hotel, the location, and the Starbucks in the hotel. We were at Times Square near theaters, subways, tour buses, and restaurants. The hotel personnel were friendly and helpful, and our room was quiet, very clean, and comfortable.'
5,'Divina experiencia!!!','Ayer llegue de New York, mi ciudad favorita, y esta vez fue mejor aun, ya que quienes hicieron que mi estadia fuera gratisima e inolvidable fueron Drita, Saleem y Ricardo del Park Central. Muy amorosos, siempre atentos, gentiles, haciendo que mis dias de vacaciones transcurrieran sin problemas. El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, tiene el espacio tipico de los hoteles neoyorkinos pero muy buena musica en el lobby, lindos sillones tambien y ahora incorporaron un desayuno barato y al paso, sin demoras de ningun tipo. Baños grandes, camas comodas y la ecuacion precio-atencion-confort, da mas que positiva. Muy recomendable!!'
4,'A great place to be','The Hotel Edison offered about the best price available to be right in the center of the action, one block away from Times Square. We stayed for four days, and it was a great base camp for our exploration of the city. Our room felt a little small, and the hotel had its eccentricities (one ice machine for the whole building, in the midst of a heat wave). Still the staff was very friendly and helpful. We\'d try there again if we can ever go back to the city.'
4,'Super Lage','Wir waren im vergangenen Oktober zum ersten Mal in New York und haben das Hotel Edison aufgrund einer Empfehlung gebucht. Das war auch völlig richtig, da die Lage echt rießig ist. Das Hotel an sich is tschon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber war trotzdem sauber und ordentlich. Das Personal war auch sehr zuvorkommend und stand bei Fragen mit Tipps zur Verfügung.\r\nZur Verpflegung kann ich leider nix sagen, da wir das im Hotel nicht in Anspruch genommen haben. Aber ich würde auf jedenfall das Hotel wieder buchen, da der Preis für diese Lage echt passen.'
5,'Timeless Elegance','Two weeks ago I celebrated my birthday in Chicago and had the great fortune of staying at the Palmer House Hilton for five days. There are many adjectives that I could use to describe the Palmer House but the words elegant and character are at the top of my list. This is an absolutely terrific hotel and if you have never stayed there, at least do yourself the favor of dropping by for a drink or lunch. This hotel has it all and the overall rating of three and a half stars on Yelp is ridiculous. I have travelled the world and if this is not at least a four star hotel then I do not know what is. From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me?\r\nThis is what one would consider to be a grand hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say Wow out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable.\r\nMy room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. \r\nThe service was amazing. A very classy lady named Tatyana from Bulgaria checked me in. I told her I was excited to be there for my birthday and after a brief chat she upgraded my room. Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection.\r\nThe hotel is centrally located near the blue and red subway lines obviating the need for you to take a cab from Chicago’s O’Hare airport. You can walk to Millennium Park, the Navy Pier, The Chicago Art Institute and there are good restaurants nearby like The Gage, the upscale Russian Tea Time or casual Bennigans. For your morning coffee go around the corner and have Dunkin Doughnuts!\r\nThis is a fantastic hotel and I look forward to spending my next birthday there!'
4,'Great location','Estuvimos una semana en este hotel. Al llegar nos dijeron que había un problema con el departamento reservado, pero nos dieron una suite de excelente tamaño. \r\nHabía leído las críticas de otros huéspedes e iba un poco asustada por la antigua decoración y necesidad de reparaciones, pero me parece que si bien la decoración ya tiene sus años, está en buen estado. \r\nDestacables son el espacio de las habitaciones y la cercanía de Penn Station (que conecta con varias de las líneas de metro).\r\nLa zona no es la más linda de NY, pero lo central permite estar cerca de todo.\r\nVolvería de todas maneras.'
4,'Love the Edison','I have stayed at this hotel twice now and loved it. The hotel is right in the middle of Times square and is such good value for money. I have been to New York 5 times and this is by far the best!! the rooms are fine and the staff are friendly. Weever ate in the hotel as there are soooo many places to eat in NY but if you want a very central clean good value for money hotel head here and you wont fo wrong!!'
4,'They really made it a pleasure. Home away from Home.','The staff was accommodating from the moment I arrived (early). \r\nStreet fair in front of the hotel that day. \r\nThey offered to store my luggage and provide me with a safe deposit box so I could go out and enjoy the City. Provided me with bus directions as I was off to the Met. \r\nI came back late (walkable from theatre district), & my room was ready. Bellman came right up.\r\nMy room was large & well appointed with a lovely view. Great bathroom, good size closet, & a safe in room.\r\nWith black-out curtains and a great King bed I wish I had more time to sleep! \r\nOr sit on the sofa and read the daily paper (no wkend paper), enjoying my coffee. \r\nBut it\'s New York & the location was great & very walkable! \r\nLate check-out was not a problem as it is at many Hotels.\r\nWhen I was leaving the concierge printed my boarding pass. \r\nThe doorman hailed me a cab immediately. \r\nI don\'t think $3.50 unreasonable to hold luggage. \r\nI was glad they slipped bill underdoor as there was an error which I brought to their attention & they said would be fixed.\r\nSo from start to finish it was Hilton the way Hilton should be.'
5,'Great Location & Value','I was very impressed with this hotel. First of all it is located right across the street from Penn Station so it is extremely easy to get to. The restaurant and bar were very nice and the bartender makes a good drink. There is a Starbucks across the street and many restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are big although the bathroom is small. The hotel also has a beautiful lobby area. I would highly recommend this hotel.'
3,'Style A+, Practicality C','Very stylish, fairly \'high design\' hotel in decent location (block from Central Park South, Columbus Circle, Time-Warner Center). Although I\'m seasoned in NYC hotels and used to small rooms, this place was extreme in that regard. The room was beyond small. The bathroom was similar to one you might find on a small cabin-cruiser boat. The service was great, again - good location, cool design, but BE PREPARED FOR SMALL SPACE even by NYC standards.'
3,'paying for location...','I was in town for a wedding and stayed at this hotel for three nights. The location is superb and that is essentially what the cost of the room gets you. I\'ve read a lot of feedback in general about the staff at this location, stating that guests found them to be pretentious and/or unhelpful. I did not find that to be the case- the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was actually a bright spot for me. The lobby and the public spaces in this hotel were indeed very \'hip\' and quite lovely, if not a bit too darkly lit..I mean, we\'re talking perpetual midnight in the lobby here. The rooms...this is where you start asking if you\'re actually getting what you paid for. The rooms were fine, but just that...fine. They\'ve been designed with the idea that you\'re not going to spend a lot of time in them. They were very sparsely furnished, but to the point where it didn\'t make sense. The sink didn\'t have any kind of counter and the main room essentially just had two beds and tiny side tables..simple things like putting on make up and getting ready for all the events we were going to became a bit awkward. The lighting in the room was also very dark and not very practical. Basic amenities like a privacy sign had to be called up for. The room was supposed to include robes, but there were none in our room. The towels were standard, cheap hotel towels and the bathtub stopper did not work. I don\'t know...if this had been a moderately priced hotel, some of things would not have mattered so much, but because we paid a lot to stay here- we expected more. I probably would not stay here again...at least on my own dime.'
4,'Perfect Location, good hotel','Hotel perfectly located nearby needed tourist places – Penn station, Empire State Building, Times Square, Macy’s :-). Rooms small, but clean elevators really fast. I could not comment on service – I did not have much of encounters with it. Hotel as usual in NY smoke free, yet near entrance crowd smoke. Tick – To? diner fast and efficient, watch out for amount of food that you ordered – portions are really big. For the funs – McDonalds just opposite to the entrance. What I did not like – there is some additional requirements for prepayment on telephone line in the room – discovered suddenly.'
5,'The hotel that has everything!','The service was fantastic. The room spacious, perfect linens and decor but most important the view was spectacular for times square. Also what stood out was how quiet the room was, no sound of slamming doors or people in the hall or anything, pretty shocking for of all places, TIMES SQUARE!'
3,'Best Location','Well for my first Trip to New York it was the most AMAZING trip ever! i couldnt fault anything! the Hotel was slightly Grimey but the Location and Price couldn\'t of been better.\r\nStaff were helpful if anything was needed and the Staff cleaning the rooms were always very friendly! all the people whinging about this Hotel need to be prepared to pay more for a better stay!'
3,'Loved the location, beds could have been more desireable','My wife and I spent our anniversary in New York (first trip). Initially I was planning to spend a lot more on hotel, but I decided at the last minute to priceline a hotel. I made a bid of $125 per night and got the Hilton New York. Initially I was a little scared because of the average reviews that I had read. However, we had a wonderful time there.\r\nLocation: Perfect...Within walking distance to tons of things\r\nHotel: Checkin was a breeze. Lobby looked nice. Room was nicely decorated (appeared to be recently remodeled). The beds were a tad on the soft side (and springy). We were on the 6th floor and did not hear any noise from street. \r\nValue: Great value for a midtown hotel!'
4,'Great Location, Bad Room Lighting','This hotel is located in a very central place - we walked to all our Broadway shows and restaurants. We also took the Airtrain/Subway to the hotel - as the subway exit is 1/2 a block away from the hotel entrance. The only negative item is that the lighting in the rooms/bathroom/hallway is very poor. There is also only one mirror in the washroom - nothing outside.'
4,'Good, though a bit style over substance','There are a lot of good things about the Hudson and we enjoyed our stay - although the room was small we really didn\'t need any more space and the beds were really comfy.\r\nHowever, a bit more storage would have helped, and a fridge for the mini-bar. \r\nThe only thing I really struggled with was the uber-trendy lighting in the public areas - I don\'t have great eyesight and found the lack of lighting in the corridoors and the reception area a bit of a challenge.'
5,'Location, Location, Location','I booked this room through a discounter and got an incredible rate. I was given a room on the 11th floor, not much view (although I could see a tiny bit of the Hudson river) - but luckily, no street noise, either! The room was spacious - certainly by New York City standards - and impeccably clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, as was the bell team. \r\nThe location of this property at 43rd and 8th was incredibly convenient to the subway (which was very handy since I traveled from and to the airport and didn\'t have to lug my bags for blocks) as well as to the theatre district. I don\'t know if I;ll be bale to get a great deal every time, but I would willingly pay more for a room at this hotel.'
4,'Appréciable à quelques minutes à pied de times square','A quelques minutes à pied de times square, les chambres restent légèrement spacieuses, cependant le cadre est appréciable. Le petit déj n\'est pas inclus, ni le wifi.'
3,'amazing location','my husband and i stayed here16th-22nd december and if you want some where central to stay then its great!! Yes it needs a major refurb but our room was clean and the bed was comfy. The shower was a little to powerfull but it worked!! The location is amazing, its smack bang in the middle of everything and everywhere. We didnt have much dealings with the staff so i couldnt pass comment on how they were. We had an amazing time in NY and that was partly down to where we stayed! The 1 thing i would reccomend iis tking a pair of ear plugs to sleep with it really is the city that never sleeps!!! We would stay there again.\r\nIf your looking for somewhere to crash after exploring NY then this palce is great, it clean central what more could you want???!!!'
2,'Unico lato positivo è la sua posizione','L\'unico lato positivo di questo albergo è la sua posizione, giacché è situato a pochi minuti a piedi da Central Park e da Times Square.\r\nPer il resto, le camere sono sporche, i letti scomodi, non c\'è il frigobar, il personale è maleducato, poco disponibile e poco professionale. Ogni nostra richiesta (anche la più banale) è sempre stata sgarbatamente rifiutata. \r\nIl letto matrimoniale è assolutamente da evitare (ogni movimento anche minimo di uno dei due fa saltare l\'altro, svegliandolo di soprassalto). \r\nUna volta assegnata una camera è quasi impossibile farsela cambiare (avevamo chiesto di cambiare la stanza in quanto presentava molti problemi ma, nonostante il fatto che ogni giorno si liberassero svariate camere, non è stato possibile ottenere il cambio richiesto. Ci hanno, infatti, rinviato per tre giorni di fila perché non erano disponibili a comunicarci le eventuali future disponibilità (peraltro, avevamo prenotato per 9 notti!!) e pretendevano che facessimo la fila due volte al giorno - mattina e pomeriggio - per verificare al momento se si fosse liberata una camera e ogni volta ci negavano il cambio (accampando sempre poco probabili scuse)\r\nLe entrate in hotel non sono controllate e chiunque può accedere fino alle stanze (le cui porte possono essere facilmente aperte).\r\nPiù di una volta siamo stati svegliati in piena notte da personale dell\'albergo che urlava da una parte all\'altra del corridoio per parlare con i propri colleghi o azionava dopo mezzanotte l\'aspirapolvere davanti alla nostra stanza (e a nulla è servito uscire più volte dalla porta per chiedere di fare maggiore silenzio).\r\nIl collegamento internet è a pagamento, cosa che, considerato il prezzo e la categoria dell\'hotel e gli standard di NY (dove ci sono collegamenti wireless gratuiti ovunque), abbassa ulteriormente l\'opinione generale sui servizi offerti (attenzione, già nella hall ci si può collegare gratuitamente alla rete wireless di alcuni locali vicini all\'hotel!!).\r\nGli ascensori hanno un sistema di prenotazione che, nelle ore di punta, costringe ad aspettare il proprio turno anche 10 minuti.\r\nI prezzi (salvo che si prenoti con svariati mesi di anticipo) sono alti e con il medesimo budget si possono trovare - nella stessa zona - hotel di ottima qualità. L\'unico lato positivo è che il Park Central consente (senza sovrapprezzi) l\'annullamento della prenotazione senza penali.'
3,'Ok. needs some updating.','Great location, spacious rooms. The bathroom is very small. Needs some updating- carpet, painting etc. Otherwise very clean. The breakfast in the executive lounge was disappointing- stale pastry. I was there the night before hurricane Sandy arrived so maybe there was a problem getting fresh pastry.'
3,'Ok but nothing special','The hotel was clean and the location was excellent for tourism sights, transport etc, however if you have back problems like myself, the bed is uncomfortable and they only have the one pillow available. They have a tourism desk in-house which is good.\r\nAlso, the reception desk was very short with me when I called a couple of times to see if my luggage had arrived (it was lost by Virgin Atlantic on one of my flights).'
3,'Excellent Location is the only Good thing','Location was excellent rest was horrible, rooms very old lobby very noisy and long que for checkin. But you can find everything in the neighborhood from dining to shopping , transport everything avlb nearby'
3,'Satisfatório, em ótima localização','Um hotel muito grande e muito impessoal. Não acredite no blablablá publicitário do website, que induz a acreditar que o atendimento é personalizado. Você terá dificuldades com qualquer demanda fora da rotina. Quisemos alterar as condições da nossa reserva, para isso mandei mais de um email ao concierge, que foram solenemente ignorados. Assim como ignoraram nosso \'special request\', feito no ato da reserva, de um quarto com vista para a avenida (recomendação de usuários do TA)\r\nHouve confusão com nossas reservas, o café-da-manhã estava incluído, mas só soubemos que era necessário um voucher – que não nos foi entregue no check-in – quando o garçon o pediu enquanto já tomávamos o café. Isso resultou num rápido bate-boca (ele queria que eu fosse à recepção buscar o voucher naquela hora). No check-out, foram indevidamente cobrados cafés-da-manhã e taxas de uso de internet wi-fi, que também estavam incluídas nas nossas diárias.\r\nMas depois da devidas explicações, os erros foram corrigidos, sendo que nossa estadia pode ser classificada como satisfatória.\r\nA conselho dos usuários do T.A., pagamos um pouco mais para ficar numa \'concierge suite\', que fica nos andares mais altos e mais distante do barulho da rua e do entra-e-sai das pessoas (além de ter wi-fi incluído). Não tivemos portanto nenhum problema de barulho, como alguns comentaram. O apartamento é bom, limpo, a cama principal é bastante confortável. O sofá-cama, onde nossas crianças dormiram, tem um colchão muito fino, o que seria um problema caso fosse usado por adultos.\r\nO café-da-manhã, embora um pouco pobre para os padrões brasileiros, é bem razoável comparado com outros hotéis nos EUA de mesmo padrão.\r\nPonto positivo: localização, bem pertinho do Central Park, com metrô na porta.\r\nPonto negativo: esperar na fila para ser atendido na recepção e para pegar o elevador.'

4,'Pretty cool','Hubby had a meeting in NYC so the kids and I went along for the ride. I\'m not usually big on crowds, but it was time to introduce the kids to the city, and the view of times square from our room was breathtaking. The front desk people were friendly and helpful, as were the valet and bellmen. Our room was clean, huge, and very nice. The bathroom was big with tons of counter space. I don\'t especially like the energy of this hotel as it feels pretty frenetic. That said, it\'s in Times Square, and if you\'re staying in Times Square, you\'re probably looking for that energy. If you have kids, they\'ll love the elevators. We rode them for fun. The room was an oasis. I ate breakfast at the hotel twice. The first waiter was less than friendly, and less than attentive. He also charged me for a meal that should have been free. That, I learned from the waitress on the second day, who was lovely and attentive and took it upon herself to bring the matter to the attention of the manager. The manager, also friendly and helpful, took care of the overage. Everything here is super expensive (except the elevators!). It\'s tourist central in NYC. It\'s to be expected. If you\'re looking to be in the middle of the action, this is your place.'
3,'Nice enough hotel. Great loacation','Been to NY for a sports holiday and there were around 250 of us as a group. As British people abroad expect a breakfast (not usual in the US I know!) we got one, which was good and varied. Drinks were expensive though in the bar. Wi-fi was too. Rooms didn\'t have tea/coffee making facilites which I thought was unusual.\r\nStaff were ok, seemed to be quite helpful but I know some of the party would have different views on this, The queues at reception were at times very long, but that\'s normal for a big place like this. It was about 15 minutes walk to Time Square and Broadway, so really handy for the touristy stuff. Smack opposite Carnegie Hall too. We were there when Hurricane Irene made her appearnace, resulting in the streets being deserted for a while which was kind of strange for \'the city that never sleeps.\' It did, for sure. Overall its not a bad place to stay, clean enough, comfortable and just, well, normal. Not somewhere you would say, \'wow, its brilliant here\' and not a place you\'d say, never again.\' As average a place as I think you\'d get; that said I would come back for sure.'
4,'Buena ubicación  con algunas cosas para mejorar','Punto a favor\r\nEste hotel esta muy bien ubicado en la manzana Gran central de terminal que te permite tomar el Subte para moverte para todos lados, es bien grande el Hotel el Gym esta en su ultimo piso y tiene una bolsa de boxeo para el que le gusta tirar un par de piñas , tiene una barra muy cálida para tomar unos tragos de noche en la planta baja, \r\nPuntos en contra.\r\nLa habitación que me toco es muy chica igual al baño muy chico, Internet paga, y lo peor que puede tener un Hotel de esta categoria es la mala atención de su personal, tuve problema con un maletero que me cobraba 20 para guardar las maleta por un par de horas hasta que se me cumplía el horario para la salida del avión y de malas ganas me pedía la plata, pido hablar con sus responsables y me atiende muy amablemente y me explican que el sindicato de ellos los maleteros llegaron a un acuerdo con el hotel para que se les pague por guardar las maletas, una locura ya que en ningún hotel te cobran por ese servicio, después de pedirme disculpa por el mal momento pasado me devuelven los 20 dolares y me bonifica un gasto de 88 que consumí en el bar.\r\nFue un mal momento solucionado por los gerentes del hotel  ojo tener en cuenta al dejar las maletas te van a cobrar 2 dolares por maletas'
1,'Beware - overpriced - Bad customer service - dumps rooms','We stayed on this hotel for 5 nights, between 29/9/2011 - 4/10/11 - The Hotel is on great location, near of everything, but next inside is a big nightmare. we book for a Penn5000 king . when arrive the reception say there not available king size . and move one night on smoking double bed, with dirty bathroom, next day midday they move on to King 5000. non smoking as request, the bathroom better but small and the water no closed very well, , Please NO TAKE THE BREAKFAST .. the breakfast is a more worst experience ever, is a small lounge, you cannot seat, anywhere, just is self service of coffee, orange and few bagels and pastries. on the last day the lady who keep all clean is gone, and there not plates, not coffee ..all out of control a really nightmare... we not recommend this Hotel, is better hotels around for same price or cheaper.'
4,'Center city oasis','Greta location, quite,easy check in,good service,elevators, and staff. Rooms clean and better than average in the city.'
4,'Classic architecture hotel in downtown.','I came here for two nights and overall I\'m very pleased. It\'s centrally located downtown do getting around Chicago is easy. Rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. \r\nMy only complaints are that the bathrooms were pretty small as we\'re the rooms in general. It was hard to get in the bathroom and shut the door too (I\'m not a big guy either). Since I was in the room by myself it wasn\'t a big deal but I can\'t imagine how it would work with more people. \r\nOtherwise great hotel!'
4,'Outstanding location','After my last trip to NY, I\'ve decided to make this my base for future business trips there. I was upgraded to one of the suites this time around, but had previously stayed in a club room. Both were of good size (particularly so for NY) and well furnished. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The club room is rather clinically furnished to my mind, and not that cosey place to chat and otherwise unwind. The breakfast was very good there though. The gym facility is OK.\r\nThe bar was over priced even for NY and I didn\'t try the restaurant, preferring to visit the myriad of restaurants thereabouts, because one outstanding feature of this hotel is location.'
3,'Pequeña pero bonita...','Habitacion mini pero todo muy moderno... es mas impactante que comodo y al final acabas pagando mas por algo que no es tan espectacular como te pintan en las fotos! ahora sin duda quizas me iría a las nuevas fabricas reconvertidas en hoteles de brooklyn eso si tiene buena pinta!!! :D'
4,'Helpful Hotel','The Affinia is in a fantastic position for exploring New York. All the staff are very helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. Our first room as on the 18th floor, and was so noisy, the staff changed rooms for us in the middle of night to a quieter room. The beds are so comfortable, they need to be after walking around Manhatten. Niles bar is very nice aswell. Great Hotel, we will be back.'
1,Overpriced,'The hotel was not bad. Service was ok, but the room service was WAY over priced. I know this is NY but 80$ for eggs? I would have expected them to be the best and they were far from. We ordered the frittata and it was undercooked egg whites with the mushrooms and peppers thrown on top. It was bad and I could barely eat it. The next morning I ordered oatmeal and it was - what I guess they serve in prison...slop. Don\'t even bother eating at the restaurants in the hotel. Ordered a cobb salad and it was a bowl of iceberg with about 2 tablespoons on toppings, with dressing that was clearly watered down. Shrimp cocktail overcooked and the cocktail sauce was also watered down. Not worth it!! Would rather have gone to TGI Fridays...\r\nNo free internet - and if you want to use the business center its 8$ for 15 minutes...really? And $50 per night to park your car. I guess that\'s what happens when you stay in the NYC..be prepared to spend a lot and get a little.\r\nOn one good side - The gym at this hotel was really nice.'
2,'Great Location, pity about the room','For location it would be hard to beat this hotel, with the westside subway across the road and the eastside subway one block away. Most of the tourist honey-traps are within reasonable walking distance.\r\nThe hotel itself is worn and tired. Our room was on the 9th floor, poorly lit, adequately furnished but with a poorly fitting window, cracked paintwork and worn bathroom fittings. The staff were good but morale seemed low.\r\nThe internet business facility is terrible. The price looks reasonable but half the PCs were never working, the response time was very slow with requests being lost some of the time requiring a restart. The reception staff are well aware of the problem and raised it with the management but they take no action.'
5,'Most incredible experience, highlight of our trip!','We are from a small town in Iowa and when we pulled into NYC we were amazed and overwhelmed by the inspiring energy this city brings. We were so stressed driving in traffic here but it all changed when we pulled into the Crowne Plaza... We were greeted by Sandra who instantly made our day! She listened to all of our concerns, told us how to navigate the city with ease, and even genuinely shared in our excitement for our anniversary get away.... The entire staff, service, cleanliness, location and vibe of this hotel is an 11 out of 10! The Crowne plaza will exceed all of your expectations, and people like Sandra at the front desk will make your stay a world class experience!! Thank you Sandra and the Crowne plaza team! We can\'t wait to return!!'
4,'Lovely Hotel','Overall, this was a lovely hotel which I would definitely recommend if you are staying in New York.\r\nOur stay at the hotel started off quite badly as after 15 hours of traveling from England we arrived to find that our room wasn\'t ready as it hadn\'t been cleaned. The man on the desk told us he would go and find someone to clean it and would return in ten minutes. After ten minutes he informed us the room would be an hour till it was ready, at which point we were starting to get quite annoyed. However, they allowed us to have a complimentary meal at the restaurant and later in the week sent some wine and cheese up to our room as an apology for the inconvenience.\r\nAside from this incident, the rest of the stay at the hotel was fantastic. We were lucky enough to get a room on the very top floor, the 45th, which had fantastic views of the city including the Empire State Building. The room was clean and spacious, and the hotel in general was very nicely presented.\r\nThe staff were excellent, and if you do stay there I highly recommend going to speak to the concierge who were extremely helpful on a number of occasions at recommending places to go and things to do, and giving us their own local knowledge of the area.\r\nThe location of the hotel was fantastic, just a short walk from Times Square.\r\nI would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York.'
2,'Beautiful lobby, dumpy room','I stayed here on a business trip recently. After looking at the website, I was excited, since I hoped to feel a bit pampered during my stay. My room, however, was depressing and looked nothing like the photos on their website. Truth be told, I felt like the victim of a bait-and-switch. \r\nReading other posts, I now see that they may actually have some nice rooms, but I sure didn\'t get one even though I paid $300/night. Mine was a studio type, but the kitchenette was no use since there were no dishes--not even a coffee maker. The room was dark, and there was evidence of an old, aged NY building everywhere.\r\nUsually I love traveling, but this hotel just made me want to get home as quickly as possible. I didn\'t even like getting room service because it was offputting to eat in such a dirty old room. The whole experience made me feel like I had really come down in the world.\r\nThe time before I stayed at a 4 points and I think I\'ll go back there next time. The room may be smaller, but at least it\'s clean and updated.'
4,'Great Value','We really couldn\'t be happier with our stay at the New Yorker. Good location convenient to everything. Able to park car for competetive rates, hold bags on our last day, coffee & light eats avaialble in lobby. Super value, It is an older hotel, so things may not be pristine, but not enough to discourage me from recomending. Run very efficiently for its size.'

5,'Unbeatable location at reasonable prices','I never thought I would see the day when I would consider $290 a night cheap but in New York, for a 5 star hotel, it clearly has become so. I was attending a conference at the Hilton and started investigating google maps for nearby hotels that were cheaper, only to find Hilton itself was actually the cheapest. \r\nI arrived on a rainy evening, and porters immediately helped me and my belongings out of my taxi. Check in, considering it was the eve of a major conference at the hotel, was almost instant. The lobby was packed with people, including some guests that seemed to linger making use of the free wifi for their ipads, but I was able to cross the bright, low-ceilinged lobby quickly to my elevator. I got a room on the 15th floor which is actually handy as it is served by 2 sets of lifts. The room was not large but perfectly adequate to my needs, and was spotless, clean and had the typical contemporary Hilton decor with light wood tones and a good chair for my desk and a bed that was perfect (I fell asleep in my street clothes when I lay down, having arrived from Hong Kong).\r\nThere are lots of great restaurants nearby, it is great for meetings, shopping (there are 24 hour drugstores and supermarkets), or shows between 56th and Times Square. The staff seemed quite accommodating to both leisure and business travelers, and that is probably the most attractive aspect of this hotel. It actually is a great choice for midtown, and all the boutique hotels in the neighborhood should take a close look at themselves and ensure they are offering both a competitive and differentiated full service experience if they plan to charge a $100 premium.'
1,'THIS HOTEL SUCKS!!!','Awful doesn\'t do it justice. Small, smelly rooms, nasty area.\r\nNever, ever, again...'
4,'cool hotel','just returned from a 3 night stay here with our 19and 20 year old son and daughter and they loved it.Bedrooms are small but the rest of the hotel made up for it.It has a fantastic ambiance,good music, good food . Check in was quick and taxis were always readily available.I would recommend here but my husband struggled with the bedroom size,so if you can ,don\'t stay in a standard room.Don\'t be put off staying here because of bedroom size because its such a cool place to stay and you will enjoy it'
2,'too busy','We went to the Hilton for New Year\'s Eve. We booked via American Express and were disappointed. The hotel has been refurbished but apparently not all rooms. We had a King bed Deluxe room which was very nice. Natural colors, flat screen, excellent beds and sheets. The problem of this hotel is the hotel itself : we asked for a king bed and we had twin beds, the hotel was fully booked we couldn\'t move. We made a request 3 months ago for a corner room, of course we didn\'t get it. We asked for a plug adaptor (as we are french) but the Hilton does not have adaptors for their clients. You have to buy one and the shop of the hotel had no stock left. No service, when you ask for something you better do it by yourself. Too many people, you have to queue to take the elevators. The reception is more busy than Grand Central Station at pick time. Cleaness is moderate in the room, very poor in the hotel. There was a small bottle of ketchup and jam in the corridor which stained the wall and it remains during 2 days, whereas the housekeepers saw it. Even this Hilton isn\'t a 5 stars hotel, you should expect a minimum of service when you go in a brand hotel for more than 400$ per night.You can go there if you have no other choice, it is not awful, but we won\'t go there again.'
1,EVITATE,'Una buona posizione per visitare NYC. E qui finiscono le cose buone. Personale superficiale e maleducato. Camere vendute come standard doppie (la mia era la 3341) in cui anche un solo occupante sarebbe sato in difficoltà. Spazi ridottissimi ed impossibilitá ad aprire i bagagli. Bagno da lillipuziani. Non provate a chiedere aiuto o a lamentarvi, riceverete solo risolini e sghignazzi da parte del personale. Sono anni che viaggio E MAI MI ERA CAPITATO DI DOVER PAGARE PER LASCIARE IN DEPOSITO I BAGAGLI! Una volta fatto il check out non provate a chiedere di usare il bagno, vi rideranno in faccia. State lontano se potete. Turisti canadesi incontrati dopo il check out avevano la nostra stessa opinione.'
5,'Old fashioned elegance','Lovely hotel, beautifully located close to parks and museums. Staff was helpful and friendly. Service excellent. Would stay there again in a heart beat.'
4,'had the best time in the best room in the best location!','Date of stay from the 12th-17 december :) \r\nthis is the second time i have stayed in park central last visit was 07 and i found the hotel fine, but a tad basic and my other traveller had problems with the room service but apart from that everything was fine. \r\nOn this visit i and my boyfriend started looking at reviews and i was so scared reading the bad reviews on here, about staff rudeness, dirty bathrooms, smells, robbing, and not getting your moneys worth. \r\nWell, all the bad reviews must have stayed at a different hotel, it was perfect! \r\ni was hoping as it was the christmas period the hotel would have festive decorations, and whilst walking into the lobby it had several false xmas trees with white lights very cute :) \r\ndue to BA loosing our bags when checking in we asked the person at the desk to keep a record and they should be getting deliverd later on in the evening she did ask if we needed any help with our bags atleast 3 times but we just laughed it off she may of had a long day. When asked if we needed 2 room keys we where told we where staying on the 20th floor! \r\nBy reading reviews on here i do remember someone saying about asking for a room from the 16-26th floor as there better and more \'renevated\' \r\nThe lifts are better than last time and where instantly fast even though the hotel was packed in the lobby at all times, stepping out the decor was nice and we noted the room we where staying i (we loved it!) 2021 was a corner room, when entering it the bed was huge, maybe a superior king? but mainly i know of the room sizes anyway from the last visit but this was something else, we had 2 huge windows each looking out around broadway & leading to times square, from the north window we could see a huge wicked poster and the building around where so nice, if you lay in bed you could see a building (dont ask not sure, green triangle roof) all light up was very nice. After reading about bed bugs we checked everything, it was fine, spotless, big television coffee maker, desk, 2 telephones, armchair, 2 bed side tables and lights, and the bathroom was spotless (made sure to check for instant hot water) all park central complimetary things around the room, a walk in (kind of) closet with a safe, coathangers, iron, and 2 extra pillows and a little quilt, the bed had about 6 pillows on it though and it was very comfy to lye in, my boyfriend did complain however he woke up in the night quite cold and had to turn the heating on which was simple anyway. Room cleaning daily if required and lifts to go down where very quick. Because of the luggage still missing the front desk where very helpful by ringing jfk and also leaving our room phone messages of any progress, the doorman (big Al) greeted you every morning asking if we needed a cab he then recommended us to go get breakfast in the brooklyn diner (everyone go its really good and will fill you up all day - ask for pink lemonade its the best). One night we arrived back around 2am and where greeted by a very much alert member of staff saying good morning yet the bar was closed drinks could be brought up to the room haha! \r\nAs for the staff\'s manners they where so polite and helpful we booked a shuttle to get from the hotel to JFK no problem with it and it was very cheap, we paid $5 to hold our luggage for an hour and 1/2 and after a trip to carneige deli (cheescake!) we where allowed to check out at 1pm instead of 12. It was a perfect trip and the location well, that is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel and around the christmas period with all the street decorations its loverly, not to mention the christmas cottage directly oppostie the main entrance, its a must if your bringing back trinket things. Times square is like 5 minutes away yet you cant hear anything at night nor in the hotel, we enjoyed it that much were already looking to go back and we may ask for the same room! :) \r\nIt wasnt just look at getting the room all in all the hotel was brilliant along with the staff and also the little corner shop located by the lifts and back entrance the man working there was so helpful in advising on medicine for my boyfriends fever - advil. Wish we got them over here. Great hotel, no problems, amazing location & amazing room. New York we love thee.'
4,'Nice hotel, But a Little Confused','The hotel is in an area that\'s good for tourists visiting Times Square (of course) but it has good business services like any Westin hotel. It was a new place and all the furnishings were in top shape. I wonder if many all-American tourists would really shell out to stay in the hotel at the rate they charge, or how many people with expense accounts would want to stay in the Times Square district. But if you can fit into either of those categories, it\'s a fine hotel. One thing that takes getting used to: the entrance isn\'t the lobby, it\'s an oddball parking valet and luggage check desk, so invariably you ask and get sent upstairs to check in. It\'s a confusing setup, and in New York the first thing you don\'t want to do when you arrive is lose sight of your baggage! What makes up for that is a cool factor: when I was there a bunch of limos pulled up for some NBA function.'
2,'great location. bad service. very outdated.','was thrilled with the location. the room was one of the largest i have had in awhile in nyc. when checking in, the front desk was very slow, with a long line, regardless of the fact that no one had a special request. the last night of my stay the elevator broke down with me inside. wonderful and scary end. it was about 20-30 minutes until the could get the doors open and pull me out. the front desk manager offered to take care of any and all room service charges (approx $100), cab fare to client ($50), and a free upgrade on my next stay (next month). The end result was a discount of $40 from room service, $30 for the cab, and no upgrade in the future. \r\nI left something in the room by mistake, and, when I called the day after check-out to request them to mail it (a small personal item), they said I would need to pay for the shipping myself. \r\nI\'m not one of those who is looking for a hand-out, and this is the first time I have ever written a bad review. All I asked is that they mail this item, which would cost them around $5 or $10, and forget the false upgrade and discounts. \r\nThere are few things worse than bad customer service. I spend approximately 36-40 weeks on the road every year, a large portion of which is in NYC. I\'m sorry to say I will never utilize Affinia again \r\nAlso, $15/day for internet??? Give me a break.'
1,'Do not stay here, must be better hotels in New York','We have stayed before and we have had issues, this year we booked up well in advance[9 months] asked for adjoining rooms.Late arrival 11pm, no adjoining rooms but on same floor, then the rooms were King beds, when you have two grown lads they do not want share same room, we did ask for one King and two doubles. We said that was not acceptable, asked to see the night manager, his attitude was terrible. \r\nCould not care less, said we would be moved the next day as there was a lot of free rooms, never happened.\r\nIn the end we stayed on the 44th Floor and my family stayed on the 15th, two lift rides to see them\r\nThe year before I said never again, this year has confirmed it.\r\nOh and i got my loyalty statement this week and after telling the clerk the number, I had lost my card, he did not enter my loyalty number so I have lost my points.\r\nNever again'
4,'Excellent service in a HUGE place','I arrived at the Marriott Marquis on NYC Marathon weekend in November 2011 for four nights. The usual chaos of Time Square is almost magnified in this hotel, and the potential for a cold and harsh experience could have made it unpleasant at best. On the contrary: the staff at every step were personal, thoughtful, and attentive, and patient. The concierge service was fantastic--Charlie made a birthday celebration happen almost instantaneously, and was humble and gracious about it. Once the elevators are not so mysterious (one has to enter the desired floor, and then is directed to a selected car for service to that part of the hotel -- a bit odd, but in a space this big, it makes sense). The location is great for anyone who wants to be in the heart of Time Square. Despite the location, the rooms were quiet and very large by NYC standards. Would recommend for anyone who wants to be in the thick of things, as the enormity of the hotel is more than compensated for by the quiet staff, the large rooms, and the thoughtful service.'
3,'Good location very small rooms','This hotel has a good location and nice lobby but the rooms are so small. With two people and two suitcases it was hard to walk around. To get to the bathroom I had to walk on top of my suitcase. The room was old and dated. The bed was called a queen but it was more like a double. The hotel also charged to leave your suitcases for a few hours after checkout which I thought was unnessary. The location is convenient for sightseeing throughout the city. If your major focus are broadway plays I would stay closer to Times Square.'
2,'Hotel di design ma camere piccolissime e molto rumorose','Buon hotel in ottima posizione di design frequentato in prevalenza da giovani; le camere standard sono però veramente piccole ed estremamente rumorose; infatti seppur al 14\' piano si sentivano tutti i rumori provenire dalla strada; la posizione e\' però ottima in zona Columbus Circle'
3,'Good Location','This hotel is not fancy but it was clean, had a deli attached to it, and was located a block off of Times Square. It was an easy walk to shopping, tour busses, and the theatre.'
5,'Was Completely Satisfied with Westin','I was really happy with my stay at the Westin. I booked the hotel based on price, location, and class. The staff was very professional and helpful. The room was very clean and the view was great. I encountered none of the bad comments from previous reviewers. I would highly recommend this place to friends/colleagues and stay here again.'
2,'what a let down','Having booked my holiday to New York and seen the on line pictures of the Affinia Manhattan my husband and i were looking forward to turning up to a beautiful hotel and room.This im afraid was not the case. Yes it looks very much like a New York hotel from the outside but our suite consisted of a bed a dingy small bathroom and a tray with a small coffee maker on.The whole hotel look dated and very much in need of a revamp and i wont even mention the hole in our window that had been stuffed with god knows what to stop( and failing to do so). the draft.Yes the staff were polite and helpful but i wouldnt say they made you welcome they just did their job.Overall we found the hotel disappointing and spoke to a couple of New Yorkers whilst we were there and they too said it needed a lot of money spending on it to bring it up to standard.'
3,'Great Service, great location , but noise from the hotel itself','I have stayed at the Affinia several times in the past few years and have always had a good experience. The hotel is very clean, service is good and they have recently renovated so it feels quite modern. The street noise doesn\'t bother me but this time I found the building noise transfer was horrendous - I don\'t know if I backed onto a cleaning closet or something but the banging of the door and running water sound (really loud) woke me up every hour or so all night long. Generally it\'s a great hotel and I would stay there again but talk to the mgmt if hotel noise was an issue.'
3,'Good Location, no complaints!','The New Yorker Hotel was in a great location, and we were trying to find a hotel within our budget, and decided upon The New Yorker. Room was small (to be expected) but clean. No issues with customer service or anything, room was always clean and fresh towels supplied. We were in walking distance from everything and loved the location. We usually left the room by 9 am and didn\'t arrive back until around 11 p.m. so to relax and get some sleep it served it\'s purpose. As far as value, and location I would return to The New Yorker.'
4,'Great Location','Stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights from 21st March 2012. This was our first visit to NY to celebrate my husbands birthday. Check in was easy and the staff were very polite. We had asked for an upgrade and our room was on the 35th floor with stunning views of the Empire State building and ground zero from the other. Yes the room was on the small side, but the bed was extremely comfy, spotless clean and the shower was very powerful.\r\nAte in Coopers tavern twice and the food was scrummy!! Fab location and would definately stay at new Yorker aggain.'
3,'Hotel muy normal en una excelente situación','He estado alojado 5 noches y a pesar de que su situación es increíble, a muy pocas manzanas de Times Square y de la 5th avenida, no se si merece la pena el precio pagado.\r\nEl servicio en recepción era aceptable aunque las filas para hacer el chek-in siempre eran interminables.\r\nLa habitación era pequeña, aunque para ser NY no estaba mal. Lo peor del hotel es que el ascensor va siempre hasta arriba y siempre con unas filas increíbles y que el wifi sea de pago, el dejar las maletas después del check-in sea de pago, el desayuno sea de pago...'
4,Bien,'Bon hôtel, répondant aux critères classiques américains... Propre, bien situé, une visite de la gare Grand Central Station s\'impose....'
1,'Lasciamo perdere...','A parte la posizione che in effetti e\' ottima, camere da far chiudere e servizio pessimo. Ho avuto una camera che per poco non mi cadeva addosso, con buchi nel soffitto di cartongesso e macchie ovunque alle pareti. Una vera baracca. Ero in viaggio di nozze e volevo qualcosa di meglio visto e considerato che ho pagato 220 $ a notte... Comunque il secondo giorno mia moglie dice di sentire qualcosa che si muove e sorpresa sorpresa... un topo nel cestino!!!!\r\nVado alla reception per chiedere una mano e mi dicono di risalire e aspettare in camera... con il topo. Ovviamente mia moglie non ci vuole rientrare e dopo un ora in cui nessuno si e\' fatto vivo torno giu\' alla reception dove alle mie nuove lamentele mi rispondono No problem we change the room... come minimo direi!!!!!!! Per i soldi che si spendono si puo\' cercare qualcosa di meglio. Comunque camera nuova un po\' piu\' carina ma sempre con la sensazione di sentire dei rumori di zampette...'
5,'Excellent base','My daughter and I stayed here for 6 nights starting on July 23rd, after a good flight from Great Britain we arrived at the Hotel, 2000 (local time), check-in was quick and efficient, I had e-mailed ahead to request a view from a high floor, the chap on the desk was very apologetic as the type of room I had asked for was not available with a view, it didnt really matter as I had no intention of staring out of my window for 6 nights,.\r\nThe room (2451) was more than acceptable 2 double beds, 2 en-suites and 2 wardrobes, by the time we had hung our clothes we had a quick walk about outside, the humidity was very high but you soon got used to it.\r\nThe location of the New Yorker is nigh on unbeatable, with the Subway lines A, C, E and 1, 2, and 3 on the doorstep and access to the lines B, D, F, and M, just a block away, when you throw in access to the Amtrak network at Penn Station you really have got the location sorted.\r\nA good runabout ticket for the Subway cost $29 and that is valid for 6 days, and unlike home is valid all day every day.\r\nBack at the hotel, we did not eat at the TickTock diner, though plenty of people did, you are spoilt for choice with regard of where to eat, there are stacks of places all within 2 minutes walk in all directions, the rooms themselves we found were very comfortable, and after having been on the move for 14 hours a day, were a welcome sight indeed, according to the literature in the room the hotel has 900+ rooms there are 12 lifts 6 for 1-20 and 6 for 21-40, the colour scheme was pleasant with light and dark browns everywhere. The free wi-fi was very welcome, though you could pay extra ($9.95 per day) for faster speeds, another useful extra is the office which is available downstairs and with a swipe of the room card you can access the PC\'s and a printer to print your boarding cards for the return home.\r\nThe hotel does have a fitness centre, though walking around New York City was quite enough for my liking\r\nAll in all, a great place to stay in a great city, mind you after having returned home after walking countless many miles, I think I need a relaxing holiday !!'
4,'Super zentral!','Schickes Hotel, das sehr zentral liegt (direkt am Central Park und 10 - 15 Minuten zu Fuß vom Times Square entfernt. Die nächste Subway (Columbus Circle) ist direkt um die Ecke; genauso wie ein Supermarkt.).\r\nDas Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.\r\nDie Zimmer sind klein aber sauber. \r\nVon der Dachterasse aus hat man einen super Ausblick (am Horizont ist der Hudson zu erkennen).\r\nInsgesamt wirkt das Hotel sehr stylisch.\r\nWir waren sehr zufrieden!'
5,'incantevole! Capodanno 2012','Situato nei pressi di times square........é il luogo ideale per vivere Manhattan sentendosi a casa propria. incantevole.......!!!!!!!La colazione é internazionale per cui consente a tutti gli ospiti di iniziare la giornata di buon umore.Il personale é gentile e discreto.Nella hall c\' é una zona wi fi gratuita piena di gente di tutto il mondo che naviga su internet! Vorrei tornarci presto!'
4,'Great location, good hotel','My wife and I stayed at the Marriott Marquis for three nights (October 15 to October 18). We had orginally requested a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. When we checked in there were no non-smoking king bed rooms available, so they offered a room with two double beds that had a prime view of Broadway and Times Square. We took their offer and had the greatest New York view we could hope for. The room and the hotel were spacious enough. The room was clean, the service was very good and the hotel was very nice. They have a new and modern fitness center. The hotel restaurants were good but too expensive.\r\nThe location, however, absolutely cannot be beat. The hotel is smack in the middle of Times Square within easy walking distance of the Broadway theatres. \r\nThe only issues were that the hotel rates were too high and, as others have noted, long elevator waits. You need to exercise a good degree of patience while waiting for the elevators. They take too long to get to your floor and when they do get to your floor, they tend to be packed with people.\r\nOverall, however, it was a good experience.'
4,'Me encantó','Pasamos el fin de año en este hotel. Su ubicación es estupenda, ya que está en el centro, sin ser de los que se bloquean por la nochevieja. Además, se accede a la estación central de trenes por el mismo hotel.\r\nEl check in/out lo hicimos a través de una máquina que nos facilitó las llaves de la habitación.-\r\nLas habitaciones que nos tocaron fueron grandes (para como son en N.Y), los baños algo pequeños pero correctos y menos internet y neverita, teníamos de todo, hasta despertador de Ipod para conectarlo.\r\nEs un hotel impersonal, pero para la estancia que tuvimos perfecto. Lo recomiendo.'
3,'Good value','I chose a Penn 5000 Club room which didn\'t cost much more than the superior room. My 3:00pm check-in involved less than ten minutes. The Hotel Penn isa big old commercial hotel with the small rooms New York hotels are famous for. I wish New York hoteliers would stop trying to squeeze king-size beds into these rooms that were meant for nothing larger than a full size bed. The bed itself was very comfortable but the only place to sit in the room was the chair at the desk or on the bed. I don\'t know when I\'ll learn that king rooms don\'t indicate the size of the rooms!\r\n Overall, however, this hotel is worth the reasonable rates they charge. The location is excellent and my room was clean and well maintained. The staff was friendly and efficient. I didn\'t take advantage of the 5000 club amenities. When I return I will again choose the Penn 5000 Club rooms but will ask for a double- or queen-size bed.'
5,'Exceptionnal !','Great location, totally renovated. Very friendly staff, room is spacious and view was awesome !'
4,'great location and service...large,clean room...','this was a repeat visit....the hotel is old but we loved the location and windows that open...the cafe edison is a real treat with good coffee and food....'
5,Fantastic!!!,'This hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Manhattan. The reception staff were very friendly and helpfull and we were able to check in 2 hours early. the hotel lobby was very grand and had a beautiful christmas tree. Our room was on the 21st floor with a great view. I would recommend to ask for a room high up as traffic noise is loud. Spacious room and kitchen. The bathroom was fairly small although nothing to worry about. We were very impressed with the Affinia and would definetly stay there again.'
2,'Great location - but badly in need of cleaning and maintenance','As someone who frequently goes to NY for theater/shopping/fun weekends, I was hoping this hotel would be a good option for a reasonable stay at a reasonable rate. I don\'t need luxury - just clean. Despite hearing mixed reviews, we tried it. Once. Primarily because they have rooms with two beds, which is convenient when traveling with a friend. We arrived in the morning, and were told we\'d have to come back in the afternoon. Expected. But we asked to leave our bags, and were told we had to buy a ticket, and then take our luggage downstairs to leave (tickets are $4/bag). Lobby was nice enough. The guys that staffed the luggage area were friendly and funny and really nice. From there, it went downhill.\r\n* We asked about a bathroom, having just traveled in and unable to get into a room. There were bathrooms downstairs near baggage, but they were being painted. Upstairs, a surly guard at the elevators told us \'this is a hotel, not a public restroom\', even though we had just checked luggage and he knew we would be checking in. Someone finally sent us up to the third floor to a ballroom, saying it was open for hotel guests because they were painting downstairs. It was locked. We let the desk person know, and she told us we must be wrong! We finally left. When we returned, we checked in, picked up our luggage, and headed to the room.\r\n* Hallway carpets and walls were dirty and bare.\r\n* Walls in the room were badly deteriorated, carcked, dirty, with holes in the plaster.\r\n* Carpet in the room was filthy.\r\n* Bathroom had metal door - rusted through at base of door jamb.\r\n* Black mold down the wall below the window and behind the baseboard, which was lifting.\r\n* The refrigerator in the room did not work. I would have tried a different plug, but the plug cover was broken across the elctrical outlet and I was afriad to touch it with no cover.\r\n* The TV in the room did not work.\r\n* The front of the shower handle (that adjusted water temperature) was missing.\r\n* Tub was yellowed looking on inside. Sink basin was cracked.\r\n* Room was warm and stuffy, but couldn\'t open window for fresh air. Did find a catch on top that allowed window to tilt in - but cut my finger on broken metal at top of window, and there was no way to hold it open part way. So it either had to be closed, or the entire bottom half of the window was open. Dangerous if you had children, and too open - so we stayed with closed. \r\n* Two small lamps barely cast any light in the room.\r\n* Beds were very hard. I assume sheets were clean, but given the rest of the room, I wasn\'t sure.\r\n* Inside security lock was broken off. Not only couldn\'t use it, but it was literally broken, and the sharp metal edges were still there, along with the bent metal where it had been broken off at the door. What could even break off a solid metal security lock?\r\nNo doubt I left out details somewhere - but you get it. It felt like a derelict building. We survived, mostly because we hardly spent time in the room and only spent two nights. But I\'ll look elsewhere for my next trip.'
5,'Sehr gutes Hotel in zentraler Lage','Wir waren für 4 Übernachtungen im Mai in diesen Hotel und waren sehr zufrieden. Die Zimmer sind schön und sauber. Der Service funktionierte problemlos. Wir waren einmal in der Hotrelbar.- Diese ist modern eingerichtet und das Personal gewohnt freundlich. Die Preise der Getränke sind im Rahmen der allgemeinen NY Preise. Im hauseigenen restaurant haben wir auch gegessen und es war sehr gut. Die Speisekarte ist sehr umfangreich.'
2,'Overpriced and Overrated.','As far as i\'m concerned, first and foremost, the room is what i am paying for, so at the very least, i expect cleanliness, space, and quality, in a $300/nite room at a 4 star hotel!!! That is NOT too much to ask for. Room 15-259 (at the Palmer means floor 15, room 259), was small and the decor took some getting used to, not at all great in anyway. See attached photos.\r\nThe location was okay, right by Millenium Park, restaurants, trains, shopping. However, i will NOT be staying there again at their ridiculous prices.'
5,'Marriott Marquis is all that you\'d expect.','Great service. The staff never did anything short of everything they could do to make it a pleasant stay. This is not a great value, but definitely falls into the category of \'you get what you pay for. The upgrade to a room with a view of Times Square was money well spent.'
4,'Buena relación calidad-precio para NY','La situación es muy buena, en la 42 con la 3ª, al lado de Grand Central Station (desde donde llegas del aeropuerto, tanto en bus ($13) como en metro ($7.25) y con acceso directo desde la estación. En el aeropuerto te informarán muy bien de como llegar al centro en transporte público, y también hay chaquetas rojas a la entrada del metro, ayudando a la gente. Hotel: renovación reciente de aspecto moderno. Gran recepción con muchos porteros ociosos (cobran 2 dólares por pieza de equipaje guardada si no entras en el hotel en el mismo día). La habitación no es muy amplia pero tiene un cuartito majo para el equipaje (1.5m2 aprox.), baño pequeñito y con esa medio bañera que les gusta tanto en los hoteles yanquis (debe ser para que no gastes agua), extractor ruidoso en baño, aunque efectivo. Baño bien equipado con lo típico (gel, champú, acondicionador, crema cuerpo) y también pasta de dientes y recambio de papel higiénico y pañuelos de papel. La cama es comodísima, la habitación está muy bien insonorizada y no se nota nada de ruido. Hay espacio para la cama king (si la eliges), y también un sofa con mesita y sillón, muy útil. Como suele ser habitual en hoteles norteamericano, hielo gratis en la misma planta. ¡Ah! y tiene Fitness 24 horas, no olvides tus zapatillas y equipo de deporte (o bajando por 5º Av, creo que con la 39, hay una tienda de deportes con unos conjuntos de correr monísimos). Hay un drugstore cerca donde se pueden comprar cosas básicas (ie agua, picoteo), y bajando por la tercera a la altura de la 39 hay un sitio de desayuno muy apañado y a la altura de la 38 un supermercado (ecológico, algo caro, aunque en línea con el centro de Manhattan). Se puede ir andando a todos los puntos de interés de Manhattan (bueno, si te gusta andar...). Bien conectado en metro (línea 6) y bus (muchos buses suben y bajan Manhattan por las avenidas - es facil localizar el itinerario aunque hay que tener la Metrocard comprada en el metro (los buses no aceptan efectivo y en las paradas de bus solo se puede recargar la tarjeta, pero no obtener una). Cuidado con el café Pershing cerca del hotel: si te ven local, tu pones la propina que estimas oportuna dentro de las normas del país, donde el servicio no está incluído (desde 10\% a 20\% si el servicio ha sido muy bueno o sois mucha gente), se te ven extranjero / europeo te pueden clavar hasta 10\% de servicio MAS $16 de automatic gratuity - y encima si lo cuestionas (¡que puedes!) te dan excusas banales (es de noche, etc.). Recuerda que puedes no aceptar las gratuidades automáticas o cargos de servicio, y luego eso si, compórtate como los locales y deja de propina mínimo 10\% y mejor en torno a 15\%!'
5,Perfect!,'I really enjoyed this hotel. I wasn\'t sure what to expect, but I ended up being very happy!\r\nLet me start by saying it is in the most ideal location - right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. It is super close to the Macy\'s, and about 2 blocks from a bus stop for the hop on, hop off bus. It\'s a short walk to Times Square/Theatre district (10 minutes max) and a $5 taxi ride to Hell\'s Kitchen. You cannot beat the centrality. \r\nThe staff was so pleasant and friendly. I must have encountered at least 50 employees during my stay and not one was rude. In fact, nearly all of them addressed me with Good morning or some other greeting with a big smile. I was impressed with that, and honestly surprised. I\'ve stayed in many, many hotels and most employees don\'t even make eye contact. An especially wonderful moment came when we arrived at 6am. We checked our bags and the manager told us our room would be ready for a 9am check in. What??? That has never happened to me. We walked the city for a while, and were seriously ready to crash at 9 for a few hours. The red eye is brutal, and he saved us from sheer exhaustion by letting us check in early. Thank you!\r\nThe room itself was very small, but absolutely fine in every way. We weren\'t in a view room (Empire State Bldg or Hudson River view), but we had a view of the city and I really liked it! The bathroom had a large window that opened (not too much - it was safe) and it was so nice during showers to open it and listen to the city. Perfect. I read that some showers had uneven temperatures, and I did notice that a little, but nothing that was uncomfortable or extreme. The water pressure was awesome, better than my shower at home. I also really liked the bed - such comfortable sheets and a pillow top mattress. I slept so well!\r\nOne last thing - the elevators come fast with very little wait time, going up or down. I never knew how much that mattered until I stayed at the Doubletree in Times Square last year. The wait for an elevator was TERRIBLE. I mean we would stand there and stand there. Plus, you had to take two different elevators - one to enter the lobby, then another to get to the rooms. Boo! At the New Yorker, we NEVER had to wait - early in the morning, afternoon, or even prime going out hours. Loved that.\r\nThis was a great experience and I cannot believe how much money I saved staying here! Totally totally worth it and I will be back.\r\nPS Lucy\'s across the street is SO SO GOOD! Best chicken salad I\'ve ever had!'
5,'Way to stay inNew York','We all loved that hotel. Clean, close to everything. We didn\'t hear street noise at night. Stuff was friendly, rear for NY. Rooms were comfortable. Lobby is beautiful, has some character. Beds comfy, clean sheets.'
4,'Great Location - very busy hotel','We stayed at the Hudson over Christmas and New Year. The location is excellent very close to Central Park and within walking distance of Times Square, Fifth Ave etc. There is a subway 1 minute away, which is very useful, particularly if you buy the seven day metro pass which is only $24 and gives you unlimited journeys. There has been alot said by previous reviewers regarding the room size, we booked a deluxe with a queen bed, but were given a king bed. The room was very small, I asked the front desk if they had given us a standard room in error, but they hadn\'t so I can only guess how cramped they are! The bathroom is tiny and would be difficult to use if you are tall. The design of the rooms and the decor however is very contemporary and smart like the whole hotel interior (just don\'t bring too many suitcases)\r\nThe bar\'s are very swanky, however, the main bar is obviously a trendy hangout for locals, so is very packed on weekends. There is a long queue to get in, however if you produce your room key you can skip the queue. \r\nThe service is very good in the Hudson and the maid service as good as I have seen. The concierge and door men etc. are excellent also and will grab taxis for you immediately. Overall I would recommend this hotel, but be prepared in advance for the room size and if you can afford a larger room - do so. In reality as there is so much to do in the City, your room will most likely be a pitt stop and you won\'t be in it too much.'
5,'Our experience at The Hotel Edison was FABULOUS !!!!!!','Employees go out of their way to make you feel comfortable,and truly welcome. We had three college student daughters with us, and we all felt safe with them out on their own, and returning to the hotel safely because, there was always a watchful doorman on duty.\r\n We had breakfast every morning at the Edison Cafe,and always had a delicious , and filling meal. The location of the cafe makes it a perfect way to start the day AFFORDABLY !!!!\r\n Our only disappointment was the exorbitant price for a lousy bottle of beer in the cozy little bar. We would have LOVED to have spent time in there, but the prices were truly ridiculous ?!! Maybe because we are from a big beer drinking state (WI)?, but we went up to the liquor store on 8th, or 9th, & bought 3 or 4 six-packs every night & enjoyed them up in our room with friends. It\'s a shame the little bar can\'t be a tad more reasonable, they could make a killing if they reduced their prices... at least for Edison guests!?\r\n We will stay there again & recommend it to everyone we know !!! we\'ll be back !!!'
3,'Pleasant Stay at Edison','I stayed at the Edison hotel in a Family room which consisted of two double beds. \r\nWe arrived two hours before check in time and were able to have an early check in for no extra cost. The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful when we were looking into booking a car back to the airport.\r\nSecurity makes you show your room key before you get into the elevator, so we always felt really safe. (The elevators were always packed in the morning, so prepare for a bit of a wait)\r\nThe room was a decent size, the beds were comfy but the furniture was a bit beat up, but for $280 a night for all 4 of us, you get what you pay for and we were just fine with that! We called for wake up calls both mornings and they worked just fine and my girlfriend used the gym once and said it did the job.\r\nWe were on the 21st floor and didn\'t hear much of the chaos in Times Square below.\r\nThe hotel is in a great location, right beside Times Sqaure, near the subway and next door to Dannys\' where you can get a great ( and cheap) breakfast.\r\nAll in all, great deal, great hotel and nice staff. Would stay again. Have fun in New York!'
2,'Einchecken ist ein Albtraum','Die Lage des Hotels ist optimal, das abendliche Einchecken allerdings ein Albtraum: geschlagene drei Stunden mussten wir in einer langen Schlange warten bis wir ein Zimmer zugewiesen bekamen, in dem der Fernseher und der Kühlschrank nicht funktionierte. Nach der Reklamation an der Rezeption ( was wiederum eine Stunde dauerte) zogen wir in ein Zimmer um, in dem die Klimaanlage nicht ging. Nachdem ich mich nochmals beschwerte, durften wir am nächsten Tag(!) in ein Zimmer umziehen, in dem endlich alles funktionierte allerdings gab es statt der gebuchten zwei Queen-size-Betten nur ein Queen-size-Bett.'
5,'A+ Overall','Location, location, location. Can\'t get any better than this Times Square hotel. Outstanding service at all levels. Computerized elevators (all 14) were fast, efficient and quietly taking guest to all 45 floors. Room was clean and updated as expected at Marriotts. Had a minor problem and the manager took care of it. Only gripe--parking. Arrived at 4 PM Sat and valet said it was already full. He directed me to a garage around the corner but the attendant there told me no overnight pkg. Ended up parking 2 blocks away for 1/2 the price ($60/night at Mar). Great gym. Lounge w/nice view over Broadway. The View Restaurant had a fabulous buffet and of course, an unrivaled revolving vista of the city. Expensive hotel but worth it.'
3,'Costly fork!','My husband is in Manhattan one week of every month, couldn\'t get into his regular hotel so booked the Grand Hyatt. He worked late one night, so when he returned to the hotel he was tired so decided to have a cup of soup for dinner. He asked at the front desk for a spoon or fork. She said they would send one right up. My husband said okay, although he hoped just to be directed to a plastic spoon or fork somewhere so he could go to his room, have the soup and go to bed. When he got to the room, housekeeping called to say they would be right up with the fork and it would cost $6.00. That is $6.00 for the use of a fork!!! My husband was paying over $400.00 a night for the room and he couldn\'t get the use of a fork for free???? He did not use their fork (his soup cost under $1) but quietly borrowed one off a room service tray and washed it himself and used that.\r\nThings are out of control when $400+ a night hotels charge for the use of a fork!!!!'
4,'A pleasant surprise, especially for the money.','My then boyfriend and I went to NYC to visit college friends...which was planned by him and needless to say upon arriving in NYC their space was not really going to work for 3 days of crashing at their place. I found Park Central, in what felt like the 11th hour. I ordered through hotwire and got 3 nights at 110 a night, which was a steal for a hotel in NYC, at least in my opinion. We didn\'t get in until about 3am, clearly very late. They had overbooked, not shocked, and we were shocked...it worked they upgraded us to as suite, for free, which was about 600 or so a night, from what the sign said in the hotel room.\r\nI heard their basic room leaves a lot to be desired, but I didn\'t experience it.\r\nThey had higher end products in the room. We had a living room, whirlpool tub, with sitting area, plush robes, and we had a very plush bed with nice sheets. Also 2 40\'\'+ lcd tvs in the living room and bedroom area. We also had a 22nd floor view of times square.\r\nMy only qualm is the room was sort of small for all that was going on in it, and although very updated that couch was the quality of a mid-rate doctor\'s off lounge, at best.\r\nThe concierge was nothing but nice, they were able to find us airport shuttle service at a very reasonable price, 35 to JFK in a limo, I over heard others paying 50 +\r\nOur room was clean, but not FRESH, in that it definitely had that this room was smoked in for years feel.\r\nFor what we paid and what we got upgrade wise, I cannot really complain.\r\nPros: if you can get an upgrade *always remember to ask, take it, as the other rooms i hear are quiite closet-like. service was exceptional, the lobby was very nice and they held our luggage after we checked out as our flight was a red eye that evening, can\'t forget LOCATION!\r\nCons: probably room size, some stuff they cut corners on and i heard a lot of people that had traditional phone in reservations have a lot of problems.'
4,'Times Square Location Hard to Beat','This hotel has the iconic Heavenly Bed, dual head shower, I-Pod doc and Westin towels. Despite huge number of rooms, we seldom waited for an elevator. Rooms and bath are looking a little worse for the wear--not dated, just beat up. Housekeeping uneven--some days no handtowels, others no washcloths (promptly handled when we called the front desk.)\r\nWe stayed between Christmas & New Year\'s, which is the busiest week for NYC tourism. Sidewalks around the hotel felt like combat zones (not the fault of the hotel, but best be prepared.) Difficult to get cabs, but the 42nd St subway stop is very close. Very close to theaters\r\nGourmet New York deli across the street has quick, inexpensive breakfast fare (bagels, egg sandwiches.) For lunch and dinner we enjoyed Osteria del Circo, Wondee Siam, Shake Shack, La Bonne Soupe, and New Green Bo.\r\nRequest a room on a higher floor (we were on 43) for the view and for quiet. We heard no street noise, despite being quite close to a fire station.'
4,'Great location and kid friendly','We stayed 5 nights for our first trip to NYC. Our 3 year old daughter traveled with us. Close to metro stations, Starbucks, McDonalds\', Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station. Many of the must do and must see travel book items near by. Duane Reade on the same block. I could go on... The room was good. It\'s nothing fancy. My husband and I agree it is more like a 3 star hotel than 4 star, but maybe location gains them a star? Clean room, clean sheets. For $30 they gave us a small fridge in our room to keep some milk for our daughter. We kept some desserts and leftovers in there too! We would stay here again and recommend this to others. We did not rent a car, no need with subways and taxi service so readily available.'
5,'Perfect place to enjoy Times Square from','Great location, had a conference in NY and this was the conference hotel and it meet all of the conference needs and mine. Central location in Times Square, you can get to all on and off Broadway theaters by walking. Great conference rooms and super helpful staff. Fast, efficient elevators. Very clean and spacious rooms. You must check out the 9th floor observation area over Time Square and the roof top resturant, what views. Great places to eat also only steps away. Would come back.'
3,'Good hotel!','For a city trip it is a nice and clean hotel. It\'s not five stars, but you may not aspect that for the price you\'re paying. The hotel is across the street from Penn Station and it\'s location is ver confinient if you want to see all of NY.'
4,'muito bom!','Estive em Nova York pela primeira vez, há 15 dias atrás. Fui em férias, com duas amigas, e ao ler alguns comentários negativos aqui fiquei preocupada com o tipo de hotel que encontraríamos lá, mas felizmente nos surpreendemos, achamos o hotel bom, bem localizado, com lojas de conveniência, frutarias, mercados ao redor, metrô na esquina e o hotel em si muito bom, atendeu perfeitamente às nossas necessidades de cama confortável e chuveiro bom, pois, em Nova York, só necessitamos disso, pois não passávamos mais do que 10 ou 11horas no hotel, então, recomendo sem sombra de dúvidas o Hotel Park Central para quem quiser um hotel bem localizado, funcional e bom preço, comparado aos padrões de Nova York.'
4,'New York- Concrete Jungle Where Dreams Are Made Of','The Mariott Marquis Times Square is an extremly centrally located hotel. Located in Times Square right across from the Forver 21, this hotel is a prime location. Request to stay on the top floor with views of Times Square (Thats what I did). Although the hotel was pricey, the view of Times Square was amazing! I didnt spend a moment watching telivision at night, instead just looked out into Times Square. Many couples staying in the hotel, and the glass elevators provided amazing views. The fitness club was average, and the rooms were typical to any Marriott. The Starbucks on the ground floor or 8th floor provide a quick location for a quick breakfast. Junior\'s across the street from the hotel was a great New York Deli for lunch and dinner. The only difficulty with this hotel was looking for a beer, I didnt wanna sit in the hotel bar for a beer so I had to wander down the street to the worlds largest Walgreens. Biggest complaint was NO FREE WIFI. In this day and age, I have been to a small motel in europe and have recieved wifi.....none here....$20 a day. Your better off to sit in a Starbucks with free wifi....'
3,'Ottima posizione, la struttura da dimenticare','Siamo stati in questo hotel una settimana a capodanno.\r\nLa posizione è eccezionale: di fronte al Madison Square Garden (bisogna solo attraversare la 7th), a 10 minuti a piedi da Times Square, 5 minuti dall\'Empire state building, a 2 passi dalla High line. Per la metro basta attraversare la strada (c\'è la Penn Station).\r\nL\'hotel è molto grande (mi pare 1600 stanze), si arriva su una hall molto grande dove si affacciano alcuni locali e anche una biglietteria per gli spettacoli di broadway.\r\nLa stanza è senza infamia e senza lode niente da dichiarare a parte un po\' di polvere negli angoli. I corridoi per arrivare alla stanza sembrano mai toccati da inizio secolo (il \'900), con una moquette polverosa. le porte sono scrostate. i muri sono macchiati. L\'aspetto è veramente desolante.\r\nPer la colazione poi si entra in una stanzetta sovraffollata che ti fa passare la fame, con un cestino che trabocca di piatti e bicchieri.\r\nNel complesso: se si chiudono un po\' gli occhi sull\'hotel può andare.'
1,'Passez votre chemin','Hotel sale et délabré...à éviter à tout prix!!!! Chambres hors de prix pour un confort inexistant !!!\' je déconseille vivement...!!!!!! Bruits multiples canalisations qui coulent moisissure dans la salle de bain fils électriques denoudes...etc...etc'

4,'Great location with excellent facilities','A really comfortable and clean room with plenty of space? This hotel is well located only one block from the shops in 5th Avenue, half a block to the open top bus tours stop, a few minutes from central park and from Time Square. Excellent breakfast. Would stay again.'
5,'EXCELLENT LOCATION, NICE LARGE ROOMS, CLEAN','Stay here if you are doing Broadway. We saw several plays including the Book of Mormon,\r\nLion King and Million Dollar Quartet. The latter was our favorite. Also saw Karen Akers at the Algonquin Oak Room. A bit boring and I would skip this because although she can sing the music sounded pretty much all the same with little variation in the Sondheim songs she sang. \r\nSights we saw on this trip included Frick Art Museum (great Fragonard room, Gainsborough portraits, Italian masters); The Cloisters, owned and run by The Met, with wonderful antiquities from cloisters of 13-16th century in Europe; also good tours at The Cloisters. Guggenheim, great but the spiral path that leads from the top that was F.L Wright\'s signature piece here, was closed; check on this before you go there.\r\nWhitney Museum, really disappointing and pales by comparison to The Met, MOMA, Guggehheim, etc. Go to Chelsea to walk along The High Line, a fun little hike, go to Eataly afterwards for a wonderful gastronomic lunch at the pasta restaurant; EATALY NY\r\n200 5th Avenue New York, NY 10010. entrances on 5th avenue and 23rd street.\r\nThe Met is always special and if you go to the Cloisters you get in free at the Met that day; we always enjoy the Impressionist collection at The Met but everything is pretty special here.\r\nIf you stay at the Marriott Marquis, definitely go to dinner along 45th Street Restaurant Row, including Le Rivage (French) and Lattazani (Italian). Many other choices along this area as well. \r\nIf you have questions, definitely stop at the concierge desk for advice or reservations at restaurants or attractions.'
4,'Nice hotel in a fantastic location.','Stayed at the Grand Hyatt during a recent trip to NYC. The location was fantastic, directly next to Grand Central station. The impressive lobby hustled with activity, with a large convention staying at the hotel. Interesting that there was a significant police presence outside the hotel. I\'m not sure if this was due to the convention, Grand Central, or was the normal course in this location of NYC. But, you will feel very safe in this area.\r\nRooms were nice, quiet and updated. Bathroom was small, but nice. Very nice fitness center. My only complaint would be the T-mobile wifi they use which kept booting me off the system. Otherwise had no issues, but am a very low maintenance traveler.'
5,INCONTOURNABLE,'Hotel vraiment tres bien placé j ai opté pour celui ci car je voulais une chambre vraiment en hauteur \r\nNous avons choisi une corner room au 43 eme etage dans la partie concierge c etait vraiment spectaculaire !\r\nParmi tous les hotels que j ai pu consulter et avec les autres experiences de ma famille ayant sejourné la bas celui ci allie l emplacement la taille des chambres la vue et le petit dej au calme\r\nc est ce que l on attendait ni plus ni moins;;;on est en plein centre de Time Square \r\nLe service est correct \r\nJe garde un tres bon souvenir et lorsque j y retournerai je retournerai au crowne plaza'
4,'Very nice, clean hotel in good neighbourhood and nearby everything...','Nice big rooms, (we had an executive room). The only negative thing is that you have to pay extra for wifi, this is ridiculous if you compare what price you have to pay for a room and in this modern times... In the executive rooms you can use free wifi in the executive lounge. It\'s nice to have (free) breakfast in this quiet place and to stay in the evening (you can take some drinks and coffee for free)... We did book 8 months before, the prices were acceptable at that time. If you want to book short before your trip, the hotel is very expensive. We made an update for the executive room just a week before we arrived, than it\'s only 59 dollar extra. The hotel/rooms is very clean, good beds, very quiet, good area and nearby everything. In my opinion the breakfast for the executive rooms was a little bit poor choice. No meat, cheese, beaked eggs and things like that... Only a lot of sweet things like donuts, bagels, brownies etc. If you don\'t like that kind of sweet things you are unlucky... My compliments for the very nice and kind woman at the executive lounge at the breakfast!!'
4,'Great Hotel, needs a little freshen up','We stayed in March this year. The hotel is a classic and we had stayed here before (about 5 years ago).\r\nYes the rooms are small but its a boutique hotel, what do you expect. The lifts are still a nightmare, would love to know how they work out what floor to go to cos it deff is not by who has pushed the call button or waited the longest.\r\nLocation is great and overall we had a good time, however its starting to show its age, especially in the public areas. A little work and then it would be worth a 5* review.'
2,'Absolutely horrendous after care','Started off well, perfectly pleasant hotel. The supposedly famous Shula\'s Bar, was overrated in my opinion and overpriced but other than that we had free upgrades on our room and the place was generally kept tidy.\r\nAt this point my only critisism was the fact that the wifi is not in fact free - which it really should be given the expense of the hotel itself.\r\nThen it all went wrong... \r\nUpon checking in, we were informed that a security deposit of USD $150 would be held from my bank account as a precaution, which would be directly returned to me on the day we checked out.\r\nThis seemed perfectly understandable HOWEVER, what was not explained was that each time we ordered room service or used a hotel amenity - charges for this would again be held from my bank account. When I questioned this the staff assured me these funds would be released to me immediately upon full payment of the bill on check out.\r\nWhat was not explained to me was that this process would in fact take a minimum five working days after checking out. After arriving back in the UK I called the hotel upon noticing that funds had not been returned, and was greeted by a rather rude staff member who practically barked five to seven working days, before abruptly ending the conversation.\r\nFive days passed and I called the hotel again to check the progress and ask a few questions, the snooty manager hung up the phone on me when I asked if this could be sorted swiftly then refused to answer the phone again when I called back.\r\nLuckily the Starwood Hotel group had noticed me Tweeting about my frustration and did offer a helping hand. They looked into the issue and assured me that the hold on my money had been released and they were to inform Visa to expedite the transaction.\r\nI thought great - this will finally be the end of it! alas no - for some bizarre reason they have released two portions of the total amount to me thus far with days between each transaction, and now two weeks and a day since checking out I am STILL waiting for the remainder of my money.\r\nHotel policy is NOT made clear on this whatsoever and when trying to contact the hotel directly I have been greeted by rude staff anxious to end the conversation no sooner than it started!\r\nI am truely disgusted that a hotel can somehow justify keeping money that is and never was there\'s to keep in the first place and to make matters all the worse - they had no qualms in removing a further $15 after we had left.\r\nSuch ridiculous and time consuming issues that could have easily been avoided have totally tarnished my opinion on the Westin.'
5,meraviglioso!!!!!,'siamo stati 7 giorni a new york in questo bellissimo albergo. la stanza era molto grande e pulita. il letto confortevole. la vista dalla finestra era stupenda. la hall tra le più belle mai viste||| in ottima posizione per raggiungere tutte le parti della città.'
5,'Excellent Service All Around','I chose this hotel as a bday trip/ stay for my Mom\'s Birthday trip to NYC for her very first time. Having stayed in NYC before, I knew being in Times Square was the most exciting and convenient place to be to see it all ( night and day). On March 25, 2009, we finally arrived to the Crown Plaza Times Square and were not disappointed at all with the special treatment we received from the step out of the cab to the front door. The location is great. Times Square is a step outside, Hershey\'s is right next door and Broadway is right there. The staff at the hotel was so nice. Robert ( the front desk staffer) was unbelievable sweet in my hotel floor request. He sent us all the way up to the 40th floor so that my mom could see it all even from the hotel room. The rooms were beautiful and clean. Safety was great too! We went out one night and came in really late. The hotel staff made sure to check for room keys before getting aboard the elevators and then escorted us up to our room due to the fact that we were all females. LOL. \r\nWould definently recommend this hotel to anyone who asks. The only downside to the hotel is that they do not have refrigerators so if you plan to bring food back, DON\'T or put it on ice in the bathroom sink. Anthony at the restaurant bar was very sweet to my mom and aunt when they sat for hours just relaxing and drinking coffee in the restaurant. No one made them feel like they needed to spend more just to sit somewhere for a while.'
4,'Great hotel!','Stayed here over a 2-night weekend in September with extended family. We all agreed the hotel was very nice. The Priceline deal made it all that much better. The rooms were clean, a little small, but not out of the ordinary for a bigger city hotel. I am still surprised to see older tv\'s in upper tier hotels such as this. The standard tv was fine, but hotels of this caliber should have HDTVs in all rooms by now. It would have been nice to watch some of the football on HD. Everything else was great. The staff here are likely some of the best I\'ve ever encountered. There was a genuine quality about the staff that is hard to find. The concierge helped with directions, getting as detailed on how to get somewhere from where I was exactly standing. There is a Starbucks right by the elevator, but strangely my entire group all thought our drinks tasted weak and different. They made mine twice but it still tasted off. Our group visited other Starbucks locations that weekend and the drinks tasted normal, so we aren\'t sure what was going on at the hotel Starbucks. The pool was closed when we went to look at it, but I heard it is nice. The king bed was fine, not fantastic but comfortable. I know bed bugs are exploding all over the country so it\'s hard to blame a hotel for it, but I did find one or two bumps on my legs after staying there. I\'m not saying it was because of bed bugs at this hotel, but I\'m also not sure where they came from. Our room was located on the inner side of the hotel (not facing a street-side) so we didn\'t have any problems with road or city noise at all. In fact, I don\'t recall hearing any neighboring rooms either. The windows opened slightly which was nice during the cool day. Bathroom amenities were great and the shower was warm. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. You can\'t beat the location. If you can do without a car I would recommend it. Parking across the street is $38 per day. The trains make everything we did incredibly accessible. My sister came from Midway Airport on a straight-shot, 35-minute train ride. We also went to Wrigley Field on a straight-shot train ride as well. Miller\'s Pub is a great place to catch a bite and beer right next to the hotel. I would definitely stay there again if I had the means to do so.'
4,'Great location, loads of character.','Just returned from a three night stay in New York at the Edison Hotel and was delighted that we chose to stay there.\r\nThe location was superb, the hotel has bags of character and the service was friendly and helpful. We had breakfast each day in the Edison Cafe and thought the food was great (with enormous portions) and the service fast and efficient.\r\nWe stayed in a room with two queen beds, and although it was a bit dated it was spotlessly clean, well equipped and plenty big enough. The bathroom was small, but had a good shower, and although there was a bit of noise from outside it wasn\'t that bad considering you are in the heart of such a lively city.\r\n If you are looking for a reasonably priced, centrally located hotel with a sense of history then stay at the Edison. I will definitely go back next time I\'m in New York.'
5,'Wonderful Holiday Experience','My mother and I took my 3 young daughters to Chicago as a Christmas gift. We spent 3nghts/4days at the Palmer House. Everything was superb. We upgraded to the executive level, and the amenities, food, service and view were exceptional. My mother and I started this tradition when I was little, so happy to continue Chicago and The Palmer House tradition with my children. Can\'t wait til next year!'
1,Terrible,'It is nearly a year since I stayed in this hotel but was not a TripAdvisor member at that time. However, my experience was so bad I felt it necessary to post a review.\r\nThe foyer is like a train station which is very un-inviting. You are assigned to your room of which I would say there are thousands, you get off the lift on your floor and are given the impression of a corridor of jail cells.\r\nOur room was so bad I would not even sit on the bed as I felt it was dirty. The bathroom was damp and the plaster was falling off the walls.\r\nIt was raining heavily outside and I actually cried with the thought that I would have to spend the night in the hotel. My partner went back to reception and request that his credit card be credited as we were checking out. The receptionist did ask why and when told said the room could be upgraded but we would have to pay the extra cost.\r\nWe did not stay!!\r\nThe hotel has not redeeming features only that it is very centrally located.\r\nMy advice is not to stay here, I have never been in or seen such a dreadful hotel.'
5,'Great location with a stylish twist','I came down to the city from the Albany area to visit with friends. I\'m originally from Long Island, but I did not feel like making the trip all the way out east. The Affinia Manhattan was in the perfect location (right across from Penn Station), so the Amtrak terminal was easily accessed. My dad did meet me in Penn from LI, so again, it was very convenient. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. The check-in/out processes were very efficient. The room was very clean and organized. I would have liked to stay another night. I wish my husband had been able to come with me. Maybe next time!'
5,'New York New York what a wonderful town!!!!!','Stayed at the Westin Times Square In September 2004 and booked to stay at the Le Parker Meridien in Sept 2005. The Westin was fabulous.\r\nWhat a great vacation it was in 2004 so good that we are returning for a second time.\r\nWhat could we find wrong with the trip........nothing.\r\nWe danced at the Cotton Club Harlem, dined at Sardis, saw Chicago (the musical), travelled on the underground, visited ground zero, walked Brooklyn Bridge and felt completely safe at all times. What a vacation. Nothing compares with our visit.'
3,'Had its good points and bad points','Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during my recent 10 day trip to the USA. Hotel is in a great location, close to Penn Station and to Times Square. We stayed on 10th floor which was okay not too much noise, only the sirens but can\'t complain about that. Rooms were spacious and bed was very comfortable. Only complaint was the bathroom, the shower was well past its best and the cubicle was too small, if you dropped the soap you hit your head on the wall when bending down to get it and the tiles on the cubicle floor were uneven and you could quite easily cut your foot.\r\nApart from that the price was reasonable and would probably stay again if I ever visit New York again.'
4,'Location, location, locations','Great location, right across from Grand Central and close to being able to get around easily. Rooms are small, nice and clean with energy efficiency measures throughout. Rooms are quiet which was an added bonus in the city. \r\nSurprised to find they charged for each internet connection in the room. The housekeeping staff was the only staff in the hotel who smiled and said hello when you saw them, otherwise, I would have rated it higher.'
5,'FANTASTIC LOCATION, FANTASTIC HOTEL','We recently stayed in the New Yorker Hotel, W34th St and 8th Avenue. We had a great time, the staff were helpful and courteous. We felt very safe with the security at the entrance to the lift area - you have to show you key card to have access to the lifts to the rooms. The security staff were also very courteous, this hotel is very well run with a big emphasis on customer service. The location was great, 10 minutes from Time Square. Right outside the hotel you can buy the city tour bus tickets - look out for Azim in the yellow hi-vis vest, he gave us a good run through on all our options and had the best value tour tickets (we checked the others before going back and buying his). The tick tock diner next door to the hotel is excellent and the diner called The Stage Door (out of the hotel, turn right cross w34th st and it is on that block) is also brilliant for breakfast. Check out the pancakes, strawberries and maple syrup. This was my first visit to the big apple and I wasn\'t disappointed - a big thank you to the New Yorker. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely return - we have already recommended the hotel to friends.'
2,'Lovely hotel..rooms are teeny!!','Came here with an ex for a few nights for shopping and sightseeing.\r\nI love new york and this was my 2nd trip so i knew what to expect etc..although he picked the hotel which was oddly signed you wouldnt know it was the hudson if you didnt have hoards of people coming out of it!!\r\nThe lobby was great all rainforest..ultra modern chic hotel..funky music playing until we got to the room witch was teeny tiny like a pigeon hole!! The shower had a glass in the wall so you could be seen naked on the other side if the curtain wasnt there..!!\r\n..great location near the colombus circle subway..times square within 10 mins walking distance and central park about 5 mins.\r\nMy'
4,'Beste Lage!','Ich war im Februar für 4 Nächte im Pennsylvania untergebracht. War mein erster Aufenthalt in NYC und habe es auf keinen Fall bereut hier zu wohnen!! \r\nDas Hotel liegt 1A top! Man fühlt sich sicher und ist nur wenige Blocks vom Times Square, Brodway, Macy\'s entfernt. Die Station Penn Station erreicht man ebenso einmal mit Überquerung der Straße. \r\nDas Hotel ist ein riesiger Komplex, die Rezeption kam mir vor wie eine Zugtickethalle. In der Hotellobby befindet sich ein Ticketservice für sightseeing, Konzerttickets usw; \r\n1 Internetecke mit Drucker (gegen Gebühr) und 1 kleiner Shop (Wasser, Softdrinks, Muffins,..). 6 Aufzüge stehen zur Verfügung. Für den Preis sollte man sich keinen Luxus erwarten, die Zimmer sind zwar sauber man merkt aber dass das Hotel in die Jahre gekommen ist. Unser Zimmer war zwar klein aber mit Dusche, Waschbecken, Föhn, TV und Schreibtisch ausgestattet. Unser Blick vom Fenster war auch nicht übel - einmal Blick zum Empire State Building. \r\nIch empfehle dieses Hotel mit gutem Gewissen weiter und würde selbst wieder meinen Aufenthalt im Pennsylvania buchen.'
2,'Bed Bugs','Stayed at the Hilton New York for 4 nights. Husband was bitten by bed bugs. Have contacted Hotel, who is ignoring the issue. Very dissapointed!'
5,Fantastic!,'Booked this hotel in summer of 2003 for a December stay. Took a friend of mind who hadn\'t been on a vacation since her husband died. I had a lot riding on this hotel as I had never been there before. What can I say? It was heavenly. Of the two rooms booked she got a corner room which was breathtaking...the bed so comfortable and the location too. I have stayed at Marriott (nice but too big) and Doubletree (ok) but this suited our needs perfectly. No waiting for elevators, maid service, or callbacks from hotel personnel. There is only one restaurant at the hotel but come on, it\'s New York! There\'s a restaurant every 100 feet. We saw 4 musicals in 3 days and this hotel had us in walking distance to all of them. Can I gush anymore?? Love you Westin!!!!'
4,'Cuando vuelva a Nueva York, iré de nuevo a este hotel','Muy buen hotel, admisiion rapida , trato en general muy bueno. \r\nLa habitacion espaciosa , limpia , a pesar del ruido de la calle , silenciosa . \r\nEn general , Muy bueno y para volver .'
1,'Don\'t Do It! I\'m glad its being torn down','I\'m not one to write negative reviews but this is worth it. Stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania last night. First room had broken tub, grout falling off the bathroom wall and came into the room with all the windows wide open. Called front desk and asked to be moved. After an hour they came and, without any questions, moved us to a new room. This room had a piece of the wall missing in the hallway outside; lack of plate covers on the electrical outlets; two flat sheets on the bed instead of a fitted bottom sheet; and rusty bathroom fixtures. Never going back and glad they are demolishing the building in May'
4,'Great Location','The hotel itself is very nice. \r\nCons: Our room faced the train and the window would not shut completely, so it was a bit noisy. The internet is super expensive. \r\nThe pool/spa was closed due to renovations.\r\nPros: The rooms are renovated and stylish. The service was great.\r\nAlso, next door to the hotel there is a bakery with free Wifi! you are about a block away from the Millennium Park and Art Museum.'
3,'Location only thing going for it','This is the only hotel I\'ve ever stayed in where ear plugs are issued and now I know why. The walls are paper thin, we were woken each night by slamming doors, lift opening/closing (although we were at the other end of the passageway we still heard it all night) and women giggling as they came back to their rooms at all hours of the early morning asking guys if they wanted to stay the night. Add to this front of house staff who were totally disinterested in us, except for concierge, plus a rip-off restaurant that charged $9 for one bottle of water with our meal. All this hotel has going for it is its position'
5,'I loved it','This is a belated review I am writing after staying in the hotel this summer. First off, let me just say - yes, the rooms are small, very small compared to hotel rooms in the rest of the country. However, this is true of almost any hotel in New York City, especially Manhattan. There just is not enough room for large hotel rooms as they are found in other parts of the country - real estate is at a premium. But I loved staying at the New Yorker. \r\nThe hotel is older, but I found the vintage features to be charming and I also enjoyed staying where so many prominent literary and historical figures stayed over the years. My room was tiny but comfortable and I loved my vintage-style bathroom. Room was very clean and quiet. I rarely heard noise from the hall or from the adjoining rooms, and door opening/closing noise has started to become my pet peeve in hotels, where you can hear doors slamming open and closed all day and night. Maid service was efficient and everything in the room worked well, and the staff was responsive when I needed them. No problems with the elevators. I found the room to be kind of an oasis from the city\'s noise and hustle.\r\nThe best part of the hotel is the location. The New Yorker is located literally on top of Penn Station and any entrance to the station - from which you can get anywhere in New York you need to - is mere feet away from the entrance. Madison Square Garden is just down the street, and there is nice shopping down the block in both directions - clothing, shoes, etc. Fifth Avenue is close and you can buy just about anything clothing-wise you want within a few blocks of the hotel, if you\'re inclined that way. The New Yorker is in a very busy and bustling area with lots of tourists, if that bothers you. But it is very easy to get cabs in front of the building (if you don\'t take the subway), and hotel is also in a very walkable neighborhood. I walked back to the hotel from Radio City Music Hall one night at about 10 pm and had a great time and never felt unsafe. The Tick Tock Diner, under the hotel, is OK. I ate there for one meal and it was nothing special, typical diner food. But it is nice to have an onsite meal option for long days when you don\'t feel like searching for a restaurant. \r\nWhat I will say about the area is that it is kind of touristy and not upscale - there are mostly chain stores, chain restaurants, etc. If you\'re looking for posh, or quirky, you\'ll need to try another neighborhood. But that\'s relatively easily accomplished, with the subway so nearby. \r\nI really think this is a gem as far as Manhattan hotels go - no frills, but nice rooms in a great location for a relatively reasonable price. During this same trip, I visited a friend who was staying in a very expensive upper East Side hotel and her room was no nicer or bigger than mine - but had cost her three times as much per night. In Manhattan, you do not always get bigger or better when you pay more, when it comes to hotels.'
1,'Don\'t waste your time here, go to Paramount!!!','Myself and three others stayed at this hotel thinking as it looked good the room would be better aswell as the customer service but how wrong were we?\r\nFirstly for a group of four in one room with two double beds was cramped with a not so nice bathroom with a slide door and no lock.\r\nBut as for service it has been the worst to date as I have stayed in a few hotels so far, I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life. Firstly some of the reception desk staff weren\'t friendly at all which didn\'t make us feel welcome and to be honest they didn\'t really give two hoots about us. Maybe because we were a young group of ages from 22-30 but that is no excuse to be treated differently from other guests. The bell boys were asking for money before they even did a job (for example keep our suitcases in storage) and when doing that they were still rude and grumpy even after giving them tips. \r\nThis is another example of how bad the staff are, one of my family members from the UK phoned to talk to us and was asked the names of anyone from the group and guess what they said sorry we do not have anyone of that name staying here. Now how ridiculous is that? The family member told the staff another group name and they said the same thing again then said sorry and put the phone down. The family member from the UK called again and asked for one of us where the same thing was said, then asked to speak to the manager and after 20mins got an answer which managed to get through to our room. I sincerely hope the owners or managers of this hotel reply to this review because I have never ever heard of such stupidity in my life. I think they all need training again and need to learn how to smile as well as know what customer service means. \r\nThe only good thing I can say about this hotel is the location. \r\nThis hotel does not even offer free WiFi neither does it have a free computer to use to check your emails etc. they were charging $8.50 for 10mins where as Paramount have 2 apple pc\'s with free internet.'
5,Fabulous!,'My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over the Easter break. We had a wonderful time and did not have any complaints regarding the hotel. We had to wait about an hour to check-in on arrival despite requesting early check-in after our flight from London but we didnt mind to much as they honoured our other requests for a nice view and a king bed. \r\nThe room itself was spotless, much bigger than I was expecting and lots of draws and cupboard space. Bathroom was fine. I think the hotel has refurbed recently but only cosmetically. The bath/shower could do to be replaced but the bathroom in general was very clean and spacious with plenty of towels. \r\nWe had excellent maid service each day and definitely no bed bugs! \r\nThe location is pretty good. Walking distance to most areas including Time Square and Central Park. The station being next door is also a bonus. We also ate at the hotels steakhouse which was pricey but well worth the money. Drinks were very expensive but we found this everywhere so we didnt mind. \r\nI would recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again.'
2,'Good, but also lots of bad at the Hudson Hotel','Given the bargain rate I got for my room at the Hudson, it was an interesting experience staying there and not too bad, perhaps, for New York City. Of course, the thing everyone comments on here is the size of the rooms, and yes, they are small. I believe the standard queen-bed rooms are 150 square feet...think a college dorm room single, but with most of the space taken up by the bed. You have about 1 1/2 feet on each side of the bed to maneuver around, but the biggest aggravation size-wise is the bathroom. If you\'re tall or a bit overweight, don\'t even think about it. I\'m neither, and I still found it a little difficult to maneuver around without bumping into something. \r\nAlso, for the premium atmosphere this place tries to exude, it was disappointing to see paint flaking off the ceiling in the bathroom and entryway to the room. That tell me that despite all their modernism, they aren\'t paying attention to the little details all that well. The heating system was also INCREDIBLY noisy, clanging and banging to life all through the night, waking me up from sleep numerous times.\r\nAfter not sleeping all that well, I was really in the need for some coffee the next morning--but there was no coffee machine in the room, an amenity that even most budget hotels will provide! Take a look at the roomservice/breakfast menu and laugh at the prices... $14 for an omelette, $6 extra for potatos or bacon, $5 for juice or coffee...just forget about it, unless you have to be part of the scene. There\'s a fabulous diner at the corner of 58th & 9th where you can get a wonderful breakfast for a fraction of the price.\r\nDespite all of these complaints, I can\'t say it was an all-around bad experience...I just needed a room to crash overnight in that part of town, got a cheap price, and that was the end of that. The beds and linens were actually quite nice, and if it wasn\'t for the noice I would have slept quite well. I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend it to others, though, unless you are in the same type of situation as I was.'
1,'DONT BE A FOOL!!!!! READ THE REVIEWS!!!!!! THEY SHOULD BE PAYING YOU TO STAY HERE!','Myself and my friend were very hesitant to stay here having read the reviews but like many people on here,the location was good and we tried to think of the positives and of course although now i know they should be paying me to stay,the price was reasonable.We arrived and was checked in.I handed my credit card over and it was swiped and told the money would be charged now.Fine,no problem.We proceeded to our room.....i say room,i mean cell.The carpet was damp....the bathroom was undescribeable,i felt cleaner before i got in the shower,the sockets were falling off the walls,all the things you are reading on tripadvisor are true.It is a hole.Anyway,this wouldnt be my quarm,i read was i was getting myself into before i left.When departing,the lady said she was charging my room to my card. i said i have already charged it,she says no,we do it now.Ok....I havnt had access to my account bit little did i know,they had suspended $900 over my account as \'authorisation\'.then charged $800 out of my account for payments.Yes it does say they may take authroisation on ur credit card \'prior\' to arrival....they did this when i arrived and did not tell me. when i arrived home i was puzzled,why was there no money in account? i went to the bank. i discovered what had happened. i hasten to add that before my stay,i had contacted the hotel to see when my payment would leave and they said on arrival.Phone calls and emails numerous times a day.......i lived without access to ANY money for 9days.NOTHING.The hotel DID NOT give a s**t.They were rude,arrogant.they still havent responded.I only managed to get my money back through booking.com.They have ignored me,lied to me but yet think it it entirely justifiable to take (without permission as at no point was i informed on any terms and conditions from the hotel or booking.com) over $1500 from my account..i couldnt buy food,i couldnt pay my rent.All for a three night stay in a cellblock opposite Penn station.\r\nWords fail me and if you stay at this hotel,you are a fool. READ THE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!'
4,Location!,'The best thing about this hotel is its location! Very conveniently situated in the heart of manhattan. Subway and penn station are 1 block away.\r\nIn essence this hotel should be split up in different sections so it would be able to cater for different demands... Now it is just a mastodont that delivers rather bland rooms and basic service.\r\n But as far as businesstrips go... If you have a reasonably up to date bathroom, clean sheets, industrial size ac... One is happy?\r\nKudos for the curly haired weekday concierge who saved me 60 dollars on a broadway show. The hotel can only sell premium tickets. I bought them myself saved a buck and was seated 5 rows of the stage! ( brilliant seats)\r\nKudos for the staff that checked me in early\r\nNo kudos for the grey haired weekend concierge... She was useless altogether!'
3,'Good situation, as for services...','Two days out of four we got to our room after a scorching day looking forward to a shower and a nice rest and the room was not done (one day at 18:00 and the other at 16:00). The second time it took them over one hour to get it ready...\r\nWe used the business centre to print our boarding passes and there was no paper left in the printer , no one was there to take care of the room and it took them nearly one hour to solve the problem-because by that time the money we had paid to use the printer ($5 for 14 minutes) had been used up...\r\nThe situation is very good, though and there is an ice machine on each floor- and it is very nice to have cool water when you want it .\r\nI think a hotel such as this one should offer free wi-fi to clients'
1,'What a disaster!','I stayed here on business, and was astounded by the poor quality of the service and facilities. The only thing this place had going for it was the location.\r\nI sent a letter to the hotel detailing my complaints (via email & USPS) and to date have received no reply. Below is a detailed description of my experience. I would just add that my fellow business colleagues staying in the same hotel were equally appalled and we all have no plans to ever return.\r\n1.On the evening of the first night of my stay, I invited a few friends to my room. In person, I asked the concierge to arrange for six glasses to be brought to the room. When the glasses had not arrived 30 minutes later, and a call to room-service had gone unanswered, I went back down to the reception desk. The receptionist said the concierge had left for the evening but that he would take care of the matter himself. Twenty more minutes passed and still no glasses arrived so I again went to the same person at the reception desk to inquire. This person’s reaction was to inform me that he had already called housekeeping to ask for the glasses (rather than, say, apologizing for the delay and working to rectify the matter). When I told him that despite his call no glasses had arrived, so perhaps he should do something further, he promised to call again. When the glasses had not arrived 20 minutes later (yes, this is now over an hour after my first request), I went to the library bar and fetched some glasses myself. The glasses from housekeeping never arrived. \r\n2.Later the same night, a security guard knocked on the door and informed me of numerous noise complaints related to my gathering. In a rather aggressive manner—and prior to giving me a chance to respond—he proceeded to outline the dire consequences should the noise level not go down. First, I pity those who had to launch numerous complaints before I was informed of the problem—from their point of view, that can not seem to have been responsive. Second, I had no intention of disturbing anyone and indeed there was no threatened second visit (although, given the apparent dysfunction of the hotel, that may have been for other reasons!).\r\n3.Neither our guests that night, nor I, were particularly impressed with the interior of the room where, for example, the floorboards were literally coming apart at the seams and some were even lifted from the floor. The shelves in the bathroom were coming out of the wall and had to be pushed back in, and in addition the room fan was quite loud. \r\n4.I had two computers, one personal and one for business, so I called the desk to ask if the charge for Internet service was per room or per computer and were told it was per room. The next day when I needed to use the two computers, I found this information was incorrect. The receptionist said she would put a note in our account such that we would only be charged once for that day. Despite this promise, upon checkout there were two charges which I then had to spend time at the front desk correcting.\r\n5.Upon checkout, I arranged for late departure for my husband who was travelling with me. Despite this, and in contravention to a do not disturb sign, someone knocked on the door at around 10 am and kept at it until it was answered. When my husband pointed out that late departure had been arranged, that regular checkout time had not come, and there was a no disturbance request on the door, the woman who knocked responded that guests sometimes forgot to remove the sign upon leaving. It did not seem to dawn on the person that an apology was in order. \r\n6.On the day I arrived I left a message for a colleague with the concierge. She verified that the guest was in the hotel, and took the written message (in an envelope with his name on the front) from me. My colleague received this message upon checkout 2 days later! This is simply unacceptable.\r\n7.It seemed sadly consistent with my experience at the hotel that the vending machines on my floor were out of order when I arrived and remained so for the duration of my stay.\r\nIn sum, the hotel seems to be in a state of disrepair with little communication between the employees and even less commitment to making guests feel comfortable. Both as a business traveler and as a frequent traveler, I know that I will not stay at that hotel again or recommend it to anyone else or to others at my company.'
5,'Economical room rates and excellent location!!!!! Could not be happier!!','My family and I just had our second Spring Break stay at the Hotel Edison. The hotel is clean, has a friendly staff, and most importantly has an awesome location. It is right off Times Square!!!! My kids loved it!!! The hotel may not be the fanciest in New York City but it is so nice and very economical. The rates were so much less expensive than all the other hotels in the area. My family and I were out everyday sight seeing and came back every evening and just crashed on the nice clean beds. I definitely will be back.'
3,'Günstiges Hotel mit absoluter Top Lage und sehr großzügigen Zimmern! gerne Wieder!','Ich und ein Freund waren im Dezember auf City Tour durch New York und haben uns nach langem rum suchen für das Hotel Pennsylvania entschieden.\r\nUnd ich kann kurz und bündig sagen… wir haben es nicht bereut! Mann hört relative viel schlechtes über das Hotel Penn wie es auch kurz und Bündig von\r\nden Hotelmitarbeitern genannt wird und wir waren anfangs sehr skeptisch. Doch wir wurden sehr positive überrascht!\r\nDie Lage\r\nDie Lage ist genial. Das Hotel befindet sich auf der 7Avenue und 34th Straße. Einfach genial in Mitten von Midtown. \r\nGegenüber ist der Madison Square Garden keine 10 Minuten zu Fuß ist der Times Square & Brodway. Ein Block weiter\r\nist das Empire Stade Building und was absolut super ist die U-Bahn Station Penn Station an welcher fast jede U-Bahn Linie \r\nhält ist genau vor dem Hotel. Also von der Lage einfach perfekt\r\nDas Zimmer\r\nDas Zimmer war sehr groß und geräumig. Wir waren sehr überrascht als wir im 15 Stock unser Zimmer bezogen. Es war seh groß \r\nviel Platz was für New York echt eine Seltenheit ist und wurde von dem rießen Kleiderschrank mit Bügelbrett + einem Kleinen aber sauberen \r\nBadezimmer abgerundet. Das Zimmer war mit zwei King Betten ausgestattet, einem Fernseher, einer Kommode, einem Schreibtisch, Spiegel + Nachtisch.\r\nDer Teppichboden war ein bisschen abgenutzt aber absolut in Ordnung. Das Zimmer war sauber und wurde jeden Tag von den netten Servicekräften geputzt.\r\nDas Hotel\r\nIm Hotel gibt es leider kein Restaurant was allerdings bei der Vielfalt an Restaurants welche umliegend sind echt kein Problem ist. Im Hotel befindet sich noch eine\r\n24 Stunden geöffnete Bäckerei in der man sich mit Snacks, Backwaren und Getränken zu angenehmen Preisen eindecken kann. \r\nDas Hotel hat auch einen Fitnessraum der mit allem was man braucht ausgestattet ist und kostenlos genutzt werden kann.\r\nIm ganzen waren wir sehr zufrieden, vor allem die Lage des Hotels ist für diesen Preis absolut unschlagbar. Unser Fazit: Günstiges Hotel mit Absoluter Top Lage und sehr großzügigen Zimmern! gerne Wieder!'
5,'Beautiful place','Nicely decorated, comfortable, and conveniently located.'
4,'Almost Perfect','The renovations on this Grande Dame are magnificent. Classy, a little bit funky and very clean looking. The staff is amazing and friendly as usual. It\'s amazing how many longtime staffers they have. Only little issue was the fact that we were given a room that appeared to still be occupied. When we went back to the front desk to change rooms, the gentleman serving us (Daniel?), almost didn\'t appear to believe us and didn\'t apologize for the error. This is not indicative of the usually fabulous service at this hotel!\r\nClose to everything important and necessary, this hotel is the best.'
4,'Clean and Comfortable','The Hilton New York was in a great location, had decent amenities (2 bars, a restaurant, Starbucks, but no pool, and a pricey wireless fee), it was clean and spacious enough for two people (in a double bed room). The maids were noisy however, and even though we had a high floor, the sounds from the street were loud, though that is inevitable. I would recommend this hotel.'
1,'Percio accesible, perooooooooo','La recepcion es muy lenta, y con un trato que deja bastante que desear. He visto a otros latinos que no hablaban ingles tratarlos realmente de pesimo modo.\r\nEstuve dos noches diferentes, y ambas habitaciones que nos dieron no eran de similar calidad, pero lo unico que era identico era el mal estado de conservación, el olor a viejo, y una limpeza deficiente.\r\nEl hotel esta en una ubicacion inmejorable, frente a Penn Station, y al Madison. A un paso del Subway y cerca de casi todo.\r\nEl mostrador que contrata excursiones es bastante diligente y amable, tal vez lo unico amable dentro de este hotel.\r\nNueva York es cara, y este hotel es lo mas acomodado en precio que encontre, pero la verdad es un desastre. Creo que la proxima vez que vaya buscare algo tal vez no tan bien ubicado pero mas limpio y confortable.\r\nNo lo recomiendo'
4,'Una splendida vacanza','L\'albergo ha un hall moderna e accogliente stile americano. E\' ubicato in ottima posizione su 7th Avenue a norrd i Times Square che si raggiunge comodamente a piedi.\r\nProprio sotto l\'albergo c\'è la fermata della metropolitana, quindi i ltutto rende veramente comodo l\'accesso alla città\r\nLa camera era pulita e accogliente, spaziosa con una bella TV. Il bagno accettabile.\r\nPer la colazione consigliamo il vicinissimo Dean&DeLuca che fa un ottimo cappuccino e ha le brioche che siamo abituati a mangiare in Italia: non andate allo Starbucks sotto l\'albergo: cè sempre coda e il rapporto qualità / prezzo è bassissimo'
3,'Gran hotel pero poco personal','Gran hotel que se encuentra en pleno centro de manhatan enfrente del Madison square garden,siempre hay cola ala hora de hacer el cheking aunque si que es verdad que tarda poco ya que hay bastante personal trabajando,es bonito,elegante y muy neoyorquino,y siempre atestado de gente como toda nueva york,tiene una oficina pequeña ala entrada que te proporciona todo tipo de excursiones,las habitaciones necesitan una reforma y la que me toco ami era bastante diminuta y la ventana miraba al interior,muy caro pero la gran manzana nada es barato en tema de hoteles,la limpieza la justa y el cuarto de baño me dio un poco de grima,lo mejor sin duda su ubicación,tiene cajero y tienda en su interior'
4,'Très bon emplacement','Hôtel très bien situé, en plein coeur de Times Square et à proximité des commerces et attractions de la ville. Nous étions logés dans deux chambres situées à des étages élevés car la plupart des avis le recommandait. Les chambres étaient propres, spacieuses et joliment décorées. La literie était très confortable. Nous prenions le pdj au Rockefeller Center qui est à 5 min de marche. En effet, celui de l\'hôtel était très onéreux. Les salles de bains sont assez décevantes en revanche, le rideau de douche n\'est pas digne d\'un hôtel de ce standing. Le personnel est attentif à nos attentes mais un seul d\'eux parle français... L\'accès à la piscine est réservé aux membres du club de sport, un seul couloir est pour les touristes, de plus ce service est payant.'

4,'Great Location....But','Hotel location is great. Easy walk to everthing. Checking in was told only room available was a handicapped room. Stating I wasn\'t handicapped and reminding clerk I had made my reservations in March I wanted the room I had booked. Reluctantly, she gave it to me. Stated it was an upgrade. I don\'t think so. Room was great - very large. Housekeeping was another issue. One morning opened coffee pot to find used coffee bag still in it. Next day no coffee at all plus no cups and dirty rag left behind. Bed was not a Heavenly Bed. Hard as a rock. Staff was not friendly. Not willing to help except for nice man who helped me Fed Ex packages home. IThese are little things. If you can get past all that I would definitely give it another try.'
4,'Good location','My deluxe room was spacious, with a sofa, table, and chair. The desk was in a separate alcove. Right across from Penn Station, which was important for my needs. Would stay again.'
3,'Big room, could be cleaner','I am staying here until Sat. Rooms are nice size excellent location. They charge for wi-fi but if you sit across from the concierge you can use the conniption from Tessiere for free. We got our 2 double bed room for 204.00 a night by clicking the banner off of Trip advisor. I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for under 275.00 a night. Needs new carpeting and a little TLC as it smells a bit musty when you get off elevator.'
2,'Very mediocre stay for high price','I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 days for work. I would rate this hotel at a 2.5. \r\nI used to live and work in NYC so am familiar with the city. I was familiar with the Hudson as well, having gone for drinks multiple times in its trendy Library Bar and club. Those trendy days are over. The hotel is tired and old-looking and the staff doesn\'t seem to care much about its guests.\r\nMy chief complaints are as follows:\r\n- I booked a superior room for 4 days and a standard room for 1 day. I was given the standard room for all 5 days and given no comp for the one day that I overpaid\r\n- I purchased the breakfast package. The usual breakfast restaurant was under renovation so I was only offered fruits and pastries. For $40 extra per night, that was steep. In addition, there was no room to sit in the breakfast area most morning so I had to take my breakfast back to my room. Despite this, the staff at the restaurant often did not have lids for the take-out containers, etc. or bags which fit the take-out containers. Given that they had no room for seating due to renovation, couldn\'t they at least have their take-out containers figured out?\r\n- My room was very small. I have stayed in many hotel rooms in NYC before and have never seen anything so small. It was a struggle to find a place to open my suitcase to unpack. When I sat on the toilet, my knees were right up against the wall facing me. I was staying alone in the room but if I was staying with someone else, I think it would have been too close for comfort.\r\n- My room had a weird food smell coming through the air vents. I assume it came from a restaurant below, but I didn\'t appreciate the smell of grease as I was trying to fall asleep\r\n- there was no bathtub in the room and the shower barely had a rim so the toilet area got wet too\r\n- the location is okay. You are close to Columbus Circle but no much else. The hotel is all the over at 9th and 58th, so while it is not far from anything, it is also not that close to anything.\r\nOverall, for the price of almost US$400 per night, this hotel didn\'t seem worth it. True, it was a room to crash in at night and the bed was comfortable, but there are many other hotels out there for this price range. Unless you get a real deal on this hotel bringing the price way down, I\'d recommend staying somewhere else.'
2,'great location, not good rooms','well I would have to admit the location is just great for sightseeing, shopping, We walked just a few blocks to 5th Avenue, empire state building, central park, Macys is just up the street. So we really enjoyed being so close to many attractions in NY. However the rooms were awful. They are so old and in need of some redecorating and new carpets. A bit of paint would make such a difference. I would suggest the management close a wing at a time renovate and rejeuvinate.Not that they seem to need to. we had to queue for an hour to check in when we arrived and most times in the reception there seemed to be queues.'
4,'Da fuori non si direbbe','Passato lo shock di un albergo a cui si accede attraverso una scala mobile, invisibile se non si sa dove si trova, e ad una hall strampalata e molto poco luminosa, fatta in modo da riprodurre una pergola ombrosa, ma in ottobre non ha molto senso, l\'albergo ha stanze ampie ed accoglienti con bagno grande. Assolutamente encomiabile lo sforzo del personale per trovare due letti separati quando il voucher parlava di un matrimoniale da condividere, accompagnato da un sorriso e da e\' la vostra ultima notte a New York, vogliamo farvi stare bene. Peccato gli spifferi gelidi patiti tutta la notte, e non era colpa dell\'aria condizionata rimasta spenta. Un po\' claustrofobica la poca luce e i corridoi piuttosto complicati. Posizione comoda per Central Park e la Subway, un po\' meno per la zona dei teatri.'
2,'Way too Cool for school...','They need to turn the lights on!! Its way too dark and frankly feels like they are trying to be so cool that they have created a hotel that ignore practical issues like outside signage, proper lighting in the foyer area, etc. Its a great location and the rooms are okay - but overal its a big miss for me.'
5,'Fun Stay at The Hudson','I stayed at the Hudson for two weekday nights in August and I absolutly loved it. I don\'t think I could have found a better hotel for my stay. The Hudson is very trendy, unique, and artistic. The reception area is amazing and the bars and lounges are so much fun to be in. \r\nThat said, you come to stay at the Hudson Hotel to enjoy the bar, the restaurant, the outside lounges, and the Skybar on the 15th floor. I would not recommend the hotel for people who are not interested in enjoying the hotel\'s nightlight because then you are just throwing away your money. This is most definitly not a place for travelers with children. The rooms are VERY small, albeit clean and functional. The hallways are also very dark and you almost feel as if your in maze ( not a fun one at 2am.) \r\nThe service was helpful and professional. I wouldnt say the service is anywhere near that of the Four Seasons but it definitly was on par with the price you pay for the hotel.\r\nMy only complaints are the very small room, the dark hallways, and the price of the drinks, (14 dollar Cosmopolitans), other than that, you can\'t beat the Hudson Hotel when it comes to enjoying Manhattan nightlife in an outdoor atmosphere. The several hours that I spent having drinks on the Private Terrace on a 90 degree night in August are definitly among the best that I have had in New York this summer.\r\nA great hotel for people in their twenties and early thirties.\r\nP.S. A good alternative is to stay at another hotel if you require larger rooms and just spend several hours at the Hudson for dinner and drinks on the outside Patio.'
5,'the lobby','a fabulous experience==So gorgeous, and full of history.\r\nIt features a lovely drink and hor d\'oerve every evening, \r\nat half price, and I\r\nreturned every evening for it\r\nThe ambience cannot be beat.\r\nSo elegant and gracious.'
4,'Great base for your NYC trip.','I\'ll start with the not-so-goods. Right next to 31st and 7th Fire Station, so frequent siren blasts as engines go and return. This, together with less than perfect sound insulation leads to distrurbed nights unless you\'re a heavy sleeper or wear ear plugs.\r\nThe hotel doesn\'t have a wow effect, no jaw dropping reception or room decor. Lifts, carpets, doors etc all slightly weary.\r\nI would however return without any hesitation and I would recommend it as a great place to base from for 3 or 4 day NYC visit.\r\nIt\'s positioned perfectly mid town, easy to get eveywhere, either walking, subway or cab.\r\nThe staff are excellent, attentive with very positive can-do attitudes.\r\nAnd its hidden jewel -- the restaurant; after trying 3 highly recommended venues for breakfast, none came close to the Affinia\'s own.'
5,'New room, incredible value','From reading the reviews I expected a somewhat unpleasant room but convenient location. I shortened <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC'
5,Fantastic,'Got a good rate but was still worried about the reviews we saw. We did not experience any of the negatives issues brought up by some other posts. Everyone at the hotel was amazing. We were traveling for pleasure and had our 2 year old son. The woman at check in upgraded our room to a much larger room so there would be more room for him to play and more room for a roll away bed. While we were entering our room a member of the engineering staff saw us entering the room and asked if he could please change the air filer in the AC as he saw our son. He noted they were changed often but wanted to make sure we had a fresh one since we had a little one. Then he refused a tip. He again stated he just wanted to make sure our son was comfortable. The room was great (huge for NYC), we were not bothered by any noise in the hotel and the location is perfect (4,5 & 6 trains right down stairs can take you almost anywhere in the city).'
5,'Uma boa opção em NY','Extremamente limpo e confortável. Quarto com ótimo tamanho, o que é raro em NYC. A localização é muito boa também, perto de tudo! Tem metro, Starbucks e outros restaurantes que ficam abertos até tarde perto.Os funcionários são muito atenciosos e acessíveis, com destaque para a Guest relation Elizabeth, tenho certeza que ela irá te ajudar em qualquer coisa que precisar. O Hotel cumpre o que promete, é uma excelente opção de estadia.'
2,'Dressing-up the bride: hip but not worth the hype','Nice entrance, bar and restaurant - plan on spending an evening in the hotel or at least take an after-dinner drink. \r\nRooms are tiny. The renovation did not include the air conditioning. Mostly, walls were painted in dark colors or wooden panels were put in. I do not want to imagine how all the nice white accessories will look like after two years... \r\nDo not accept a room on the lower floors since they are quite noisy (air conditioners in front of your window). According to the staff, these are assigned to people checking in later - or toursists like us (this is my assumption).'
3,'Needs improvement, better attention to detail for spg members','Overall, experience was fine, but...check in service was inattentive and unhelpful, and rooms had not been cleaned thoroughly. Not worth spg upgrade points, just go a couple thousand more points and stay at the st Regis. And finally, the westin pillows are TERRIBLE. Ridiculous how small and flat they are.'
5,'Amazing views from the top floors and good value for the money!','I had the chance to stay at the New Yorker hotel during my first trip to NYC. The hotel is really central (the same street as the Empire state building) and really close to the subway, however you can just walk to most sites. I was in room 3226 and got an amazing view of the skyline with the Empire state and the Chrysler buildings. Rooms are clean and the staff very kind, many thanks to the receptionists and Mr John at concierge who organized my transfer to the airport. A perfect place to stay if you\'re going to NYC for the first time!'
3,'Pessima struttura ma centrale','Eravamo in tour e questo è stato il nostro ultimo albergo. Rispetto agli altri, molto puliti e confortevoli,il Park Central è stato in assoluto il peggiore: sporco è dire poco, tende macchiate di muffa, polvere in ogni angolo, moquette che aveva visto giorni mogliori...inoltre lampadine fulminate, bagno mal funzionante sempre avvolto dalla condensa ed antiquato, spazi ristretti. In compenso la posizione è strategica e quasi fa dimenticare la pessima e trascurata struttura alberghiera. Nota positiva: il personale parlava italiano e veloce nell\'effettuare prenotazioni.'
5,'Great hotel and location','I took my wife here for a romantic getaway for the weekend. This is a really nice hotel. We arrived really late after our flight was delayed and they checked us in quickly. A representative (and representative in training) showed us to our room and carried our luggage. Complementary internet, bottled water. Things I expect in an upscale hotel. We had a corner room with a nice view and a king bed. The room and bathroom were a nice size. I\'ve heard that rooms at some hotels in NY are rather small. The location of the hotel could not be better. One block off Times Square and only a few blocks from some broadway theaters. I stayed here using Star Points. Before I decided to use Star Points, I was comparing prices of this hotel to others nearby and it\'s competitive and reasonable given the type of hotel and location. I hope to get back here.'
1,'Dreck - Ekel - Ungeziefer - Hilfe!!!!','Leider hatten wir das Pech ausgerechnet an dieses Hotel zu kommen! Die Nacht hat uns 125 Euro gekostet und was wir bekamen war keine 20 Euro Wert! Kein Witz! Unser Zimmer sah exakt genauso aus wie auf den vielen und unzähligen Ekelphotos. Meines Wissens sind die meisten der Zimmer in einem fürchterlichen Zustand. Wir hatten löchrige und stinkende Bettwäsche. Schimmel war an den Wänden und am Vorhang im Schlafzimmer. Der Teppich besudelt. Die Fernbedienung für den TV völlig versifft und defekt. Aber dafür mit viel Klebeband umwickelt. Im Bad kam der Putz runter und die Becken waren dreckig und teilweise war die Keramik der Wanne und Toilette abgesprungen und zerschlagen. Ich hatte Bissspuren von den sogenannten Bed Bugs und das Nacht für Nacht! Hätte niemals so etwas für möglich gehalten. Sowas in einer Stadt wie NY. Aber dafür war die Lage klasse. Tut es euch lieber nicht an, soetwas kann den Urlaub vermiesen!!! \r\nNachdem wir unten an der Rezeption um ein anderes Zimmer gebeten haben, wurden wir gelangweilt abgewiesen, es sei nichts anderes verfügbar, einfach so! \r\nHoffe es hilft!\r\nGruß\r\nDaniel'
5,'We loved it and we\'ll be back','Absolutely EVERYTHING about the Crowne Times Square was excellent. The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful at ALL times and nothing was ever a trouble to them. We made wonderful friends there, Junior, Jerry, Emily and others whose names, I unfortunately, can\'t remember. The hotel was central to everything , therefore was in walking distance to most places, and it was great to come back to your lovely bar area for a drink and a rest each afternoon. We can\'t wait to visit the Crowne in the future, as we would loved it so much!! The food was also absolutely beautiful as was the accommodation. A magnificent place to stay!!!! THANKYOU.'
2,'Subpar stay','Stayed at Westin Times Square Feb 1, 2012. I\'ve stayed at Marriott marquis, Sheraton, Doubletree. All 4 star hotels in Times Square. The Westin wasnt nearly as enjoyable. Check in staff was rude and unhelpful. The room wasnt cleaned properly. Not enough towels provided. Staff on ground floor worked impossibly slow to retrieve luggage. Extremely subpar at best.'
5,'Best service ever','Went for work conference and loved this majestic hotel. Was recovering from prior surgery and staff went out of their way to accommodate. Great size room with modern new decor. Room service good and restaurant suggestions well. Loved location near Art Institute. Highly recommend river architecture boat tour and dinner at Italian Village. Woud stay again.'
5,'Simply Great','I am so much looking forward to my next stay. If I were American and lived in the neighbourhood,\r\nI would stay there every weekend ... I am simply in love with that gorgeous Hudson.'
4,'Times Square time of my life','My husband and I stayed there last week and had a great time being right there in the mix of all the people, restaurants and shows! The hotel is beautiful, the breakfast was wonderful, and the bar was always welcoming! Our bartender while we were there, Keith, was so accomodating and genuinely friendly! We will be coming back very soon!! Love this hotel and love NYC!!!'
4,'Nice hotel, but a little overrated','I stayed here for free with some points I racked up on Citi\'s ThankYou network. It was a nice place, and given its history it is definitely worth staying at if you haven\'t before and you can get a competitive rate. The location is convenient to Union Station and points of interest in the loop. It\'s a bit of a hike up to Magnificent Mile, but a nice walk or a bus ride will get you to that part of town pretty easily.\r\nThe only interaction I had with the staff was at check-in, but found them to be very friendly and professional. Additionally, they were accommodating in allowing me to check-in a little early.\r\nThe room was very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was quite small but still functional.\r\nDespite the positive aspects, the hotel has a number of shortcomings.\r\nAs others have said, the hotel has a bit of a tired feel. The furniture in my room was newer but already showing signs of wear and tear, including a large knick on the dresser and a completely missing knob on the desk drawer. The only seating in the room besides the bed was a somewhat uncomfortable desk chair. \r\nThe view out of my room was of absolutely nothing besides rooms on the other side of the hotel, which wasn\'t very exciting. On top of that, the windows are quite small and the design of the hotel made the room feel very isolated - adding to the general tired/dull feeling of the hotel.\r\nThe hotel tries to portray itself as a four-diamond level property, while in reality the AAA three diamond rating it received is more realistic of what you will actually experience at the hotel. Again, if you can find a good rate and haven\'t experienced the hotel before, it\'s worth it for the historical experience. Other than that, it\'s pretty average.'
3,'Great Location; Average Value','It comes down to personal service with this hotel. There are spots of very good service and product at this hotel ... some of the best I have seen at 4 star level hotels; namely the bellhops and breakfast staff. Also, this hotel offers one of the best breakfasts you will get at this level of hotel. I enjoyed the bellhops they really do help you out. The Maids are very good too. The location is self explanatory -- it ROCKS! But it ends there. We were told by a staff member that the hotel has contracted out its concierge service and I left asking myself -- why even have them? We showed up at the concierge desk at 10 minutes before 8 am and noticed that the person on duty was behind the counter. He abruptly told us, before we even had a chance to say good morning, that he would not \'open\' until 8 am. We went back at 8 and asked him for directions in using the metro -- which he told us just to walk and not bother with the metro; and when I told him of a problem with my coffee maker, he told me to call room maintenance. When I cast a puzzled look back at him, he promptly made the call for me. However, later that night, I noticed that noone had come and fixed my coffee pot and had to recall maintenance. On another occasion, with another concierge, I had a problem with the business center -- and the concierge told me to take the problem to the front desk -- despite the hotel guidelines saying that the concierge was in charge of the business center. What gives? Talk about a waste of money in having a useless concierge function at your hotel. Amateurs. As far as location, this place is hard to beat. But stay in a high floor on the back side of the hotel unless you want the noise. I do recommend this hotel, it is very expensive anywhere on Times Square -- just go with lower expectations. And bring a lot of cash or wiggle room on your credit card. The bar staff is good but again, the offers are very expensive. Oh yea, the rooms are ok. The 2 beds take up almost the entire room; but we warned: you can hear the other people in the connecting room clearly in their conversations and during their other necessary and sometimes unnecessary functions. Also, the heating system operates either straight on or off in high, medium or low and unless you had the heat at about halfway -- it was sweaty and stifling. Outdoor temperaturs were in the low 20s F.'
2,'Oh Dear...','We arrived from Las Vegas after spending 7 days there and the next 3 days in the Edison Hotel was the final stay of our Package Holiday. What a let down!!! The reception area of the Hotel was nice enough but our room on the 15th floor was small and very basic. Since it was only for 3 nights we decided it would do, that was until the NOISE started which sounded like people in the room above us constantly scraping their chair accross the floor. We soon found out our room was next to the lift shaft and the noise of the lifts creaking up and down went on all night. The bathroom was tiny and frankly the whole hotel was really old fashioned and not what we would have chosen had we booked ourselves. Sorry would not recommend this one.'
3,'Sehr gute Lage aber etwas abgewohnt, laut und kein guter Service!','Meine Frau und ich hatten dieses Hotel für einen kurzen New York Aufenthalt gebucht, weil es sehr gut gelegen und gut bewertet war. Ab der Lage gibt es wirklich überhaupt nichts auszusetzen. Das Hotel sieht von außen sehr beeindruckend aus und auch die Halle ist architektonisch sehr ansprechend. Leider verströmt der Raum aber durch die vielen, vielen Personen, die mit Koffern auf den Sofas hocken, eher Bahnhofshallenathmosphäre als Gemütlichkeit. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption arbeiten effizient (um es mal freundlich auszudrücken). Ein Lächeln oder freundliches Wort ist eher nicht zu erwarten. Man bekommt eher vermittelt zu stören, wenn man einen Wunsch äußert. Auf die Nachfrage nach einem Adapter für die Steckdose erhielten wir lediglich den Hinweis, der Drugstore auf der anderen Straßenseite hätte rund um die Uhr geöffnet. Von einem Hotel dieser Kategorie erwarte ich mir da anderes!\r\nUnser Zimmer war - wie in NY üblich - klein. Aber das hatten wir nicht anders erwartet. Problematischer allerdings war, dass die Wasserleitungen einen solchen Druck hatten, dass wir jedes Mal wach wurden, wenn im Nachbarzimmer auch nur der Wasserhahn aufgedreht wurde. Und die Dusche erst war dermaßen laut zu hören!\r\nInsgesamt würde ich das Hotel wohl zukünftig nicht mehr auswählen.'
4,'Great hotel, great location','We stayed in Oct 11 and enjoyed our stay. The room was spotless and recently refurbished. The staff were really helpful and friendly. The location is perfect for subway, empire state and times square. All are only a short walk away. We would defiantly stay again and recommend. The only negative was the room was a little smaller than we thought but this was made up for by the overall experience.'
5,'Our First Annual Palmer House Stay','I suprised my kids with a night at the Palmer House as a Christmas gift. By the time we left both boys 9 and 13 asked if we can do this every year. It felt like we escaped and had a 1 day vacation. We all absolutely loved it!!! We has a regular room which really wasn\'t any different from any other hotel you have stayed at. Next year I will upgrade to add to the whole experience. Was a little disappointing to be staying in a grand hotel and only have a regular hilton room. Overall I would strongly recommend staying at the Palmer House Hilton. There was not a moment while we were out of our room that staff didn\'t say hello and assist with any needs. I can\'t wait til next year.... We may have to do it again in summer!'
5,'Fantastic Girl\'s Weekend','Spent 2 nights at the Affinia Manhatten with 2 girlfriends. We assumed 3 of us in a room would be a tight fit but were surprised and extremely pleased with the amount of space in the studio suite. 2 extremely comfortable double beds and a pull out couch which the one girl said was very comfy. Awesome having a small kitchen so we could store breakfast food and leftovers and even a small stovetop if one wanted to cook. Location was terrific - so much within 15 minute walk and Penn station across the street. Sirens very loud, even on floor 22, but we expected it and so were not bothered. Staff extremely friendly. We got to the hotel at noon and they checked us in early and allowed us a 3 pm checkout on our last day. The maid on our floor when we arrived was extraordinary helpful.'
5,'Love this Hotel!','We stay in Manhattan frequently and absolutely love the Affinia Manhattan. We are always greeted by a friendly staff upon check in. All requests are met promptly. The rooms are immaculate, and beautifully decorated. I have been upgraded as a perk on many occasions to a larger room than we booked. We will be staying there again in July and were just there in April. I have stayed at too many hotels to mention, but the only repeat has been the Affinia Manhattan. Close proximity to everything! Great bagels around the corner : ) And St. Francis Church is beautiful.'
5,'Birthday/shopping Trip','My daughter booked this hotel online for my birthday for us both to go and visit New York, see the sights, do some shooping and see some shows. My daugher had been before; however this was my first time. On arrival we were greeted by Mohammed who looked after us ensuring we had a room with excellent views and also gave us a box of chocolates. As soon as we arrived in the room he called to make sure we were happy (nice touch). The size was good, bigger than I expected, clean with a comfy bed and pillows. Fantastic location,good food, good service. I would go back to this hotel for sure.'
4,'bon hotel','j\'ai logé au 42° étage, pas de bruit de rue. Une salle de bain correcte avec une petite baignoire qui sert de douche (à 2 têtes). Aucun problème rencontré, Wifi gratuit (en tout cas pour mon tarif). Hotel très bien situé à 50 m de Time square, proche du metro et du bus terminal. Empire state et top of the rock à +/- 15 minutes à pied. Aucun probleme de check in, express check out sans problème. Nombreux restaurants dans les environs'
5,'Great place and location in the heart of Chicago','My girlfriend and I spent a long weekend at the Palmer House Hilton in August 2012. The front desk and service was very good. The furniture and decor of the room were very nice though the rooms are not large, but not unusual for a downtown location. The location was excellent for getting to Millenium Park and all of downtown Chicago.'
4,'Don\'t be put off by previous poor reviews.','Just arrived back after a 4 night stay. Hotel is perfectly acceptable particularly bearing in mind the cost. Great location only 5 mins walk from Times square.\r\nWe were on a 4 day trip to see the sights and enjoy the social side of NYC, so a good clean hotel is all that is required to tick the boxes. Rooms are more than adequate for the purpose required ie sleep and shower.'
5,'Great Mid-town Hotel','We checked in on a very busy Sunday-before-Christmas. The room was certainly above average as far as amenities, as well as square footage. After our first venture out, it was apparent what a wonderful location we had. We made our way to Central Park and Times Square in no time. All employees of the hotel that we encountered were very polite and helpful. This is an excellent hotel for a quick (or extended) stay in the city for seeing the sights and wonderful exploring.'
5,'Great location for Thanksgiving trip','Stayed in a King corner room. Views of Hudson River and Times Square. Easy to get to restaurants, shows, Radio City and Macy\'s Thanksgiving parade route. Ate breakfast in the restaurant once. Very overpriced ($32 for buffet; $24 for scrambled eggs/toast). Each night we\'d meet back in the lobby bar to talk about our day. A bit noisy, but very friendly wait staff. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit our daughter. Clean rooms, courteous staff.'
3,'Great common areas, minuscule view-less rooms','Everyone needs to visit the Palmer House Hilton, but I don\'t think anyone needs to stay here. There is a lot of real old world opulence in the hotel\'s lobby and bar, and the location is a great one on the loop. But then when it comes to the room, I was given a full size bed that was supposed to be a King size one and the phone was not working--even after I told reception about the problem. The bathroom was so small they had placed the toilet paper holder in such a location you had to reach back over your right shoulder to get while sitting down. Certainly not great design by whomever renovated these rooms. Meanwhile, the bathtub would drain water at a glacial speed.Add to these ridiculous rates, and you have a perfect disappointment.'
5,'LOVED IT WILL ALWAYS BE GOING BACK THERE AS A WESTIN GUEST!!!','i stayed at the westin in january 2011 it was my first trip to new york and the hotel played a huge part in making me fall in the love with the place, the rooms were gorgeous we stayed in a deluxe guest room and it was great we had a good few of the empire state building and i felt very at ease and safe here during my stay, the location is fantastic right around the corner from times square and very good for being close the the theater, i must say when u walk out the main entrance of the westin there is a little deli opposite and they do the best pancakes ever! already booked to go back next year in January !!!! thank you westin times square!!!!'
1,'No reason to stay here but location.','This hotel is disgusting. Rooms are terrible. Tiny. Unclean. Rough linens. The counter line for checking in and out took forty minutes. I will never stay here again. Ever. And we have the most expensive package. The complimentary continental breakfast us just in a hotel room without a bed and some muffins and bagels.'
3,'Cheap and Cheerful!','I stayed in this hotel in January, it cost $500 for 4 nights - the rooms are not nice in any way, the staff are ok but the location is absolutely spot on. I\'d definitely stay here again and I\'ve been told that if you complain about the room they\'ll give you a better one so might try that the next time!!!\r\nAll in all you get what you pay for with the Penn hotel - a clean bed to lay down and a fab location.'
5,excelente,'cuando llegamos al hotel fuimos recibidos y atendidos inmediatamente, nos asignaron una habitacion muy comoda, amplia y muy bien equipada. todos los requerimientos que tuvimos fueron atendidos a la brevedad. En el momento del check out nos dieron la posibilidad de permanecer hasta un horario acorde con la salida de nuestro vuelo. La atencion fue excelente'
5,'GREAT HOTEL','This is a great hotel very clean and the executive lounge is very good.\r\nFree drinks\r\nFree food\r\nFree Internet \r\nWe stayed In a suite and we received a large plate of sliced melon and chocolate dipped fruit free of charge thanks to kellie \r\nYou will not be disspointed with this hotel It comes up to the high Hilton standard\r\nThe hotel does have 44 floors so If you don\'t like heights ask for low floor'
4,'Excellent location! Hotel is great!','Expensive no doubt, but rooms are good, albeit, a bit worn. Breakfast was superb! Great stay for 3 nights!'
2,'sporco e trascurato','Hotel che gode di una posizione strategica sulla 7 avenue a due passi da Time Square e vicinissimo alla metro e alla fermata dei bus per i tour della città. Peccato però che il servizio dell\'hotel sia veramente di livello pessimo: la hall e la sala per la colazione sono moderne e di design, ma la salita ai piani riserva una amara sorpresa: lunghi e squallidi corridoi con pareti scrostate e moquette sgualcita e mai pulita; camere veramente fatiscenti: arredo vecchio e logoro, servizi igienici sporchi e personale al piano che anzichè pulire camere e pavimenti trascorre ore intere a messaggiare e chattare accanto al carrello delle pulizie incurante dei turisti che passano.... Inaccettabile ! in bagno è caduto un gettone colorato a mio figlio sul pavimento il primo giorno ed è rimasto per 4 giorni nella stessa identica posizione segno che nessuno ha mai pensato di passare uno straccio o la scopa a terra. La colazione del mattino è discreta: tanta frutta fresca (more, lamponi, fragole melone ottimi), affettati, formaggi, brioches. Peccato però che tutto questo non compensi la trascuratezza e la sporcizia delle camere in cui schifa solo l\'idea di stendersi a letto o lavarsi sotto la doccia. da non ripetere mai più una sosta in questo hotel.'
3,'New grand club','Great location and new grand club staff. However, If you want a glass of cheap wine, go elsewhere and avoid the Grand club,a rip off as compared to other Hyatt clubs.'
5,'Great Times Square location','Came back to this hotel for another stay (last one was 2 years ago). The renovations to the rooms and restaurants were very well done, and have made this hotel an even better option in midtown NYC. The furnishing are attractive, and the Marriott beds are very comfortable. I have to agree with other reviewers who note the large size of the rooms at this location, which is particularly notable if you\'re traveling with family to NYC.\r\nThe big plus is the location right in the middle of Times Square, and convenient the 42nd Street subway hub for many of the subway lines (the hotel is between 45th and 46th Streets).\r\nOne note for Marriott Elite Reward members and those who reserve Concierge level rooms. The Conceirge Lounge is THE busiest and most crowded I have ever experienced. Since there were large numbers of leisure travelers at this hotel, the later morning times were busier than earlier times. Lines of up to 20 people were not uncommon around 9am. One of the service people told us there is room for approximately 90 people, and it\'s not uncommon for them to have 500+ for breakfast service.'
5,'Our new favourite hotel in New York!','We have stayed in a number of New York City hotels, and this was definitely the best so far. I contacted the hotel directly to book a room, and after asking about special promotional rates I was given an amazingly low rate for NYC. I was a little nervous but booked the room because it had a kitchen and a great location. We were pleasantly surprised on our arrival. The room was huge, the king size bed was incredibly comfortable, and the hotel staff were very polite and helpful. The room was very clean and the kitchen was a great convenience. There were a lot of windows in the room, though the views were not spectacular. Best of all it was quiet and I slept like a baby, and I am a light sleeper! We will definitely return to the Affinia Manhattan.'
2,'Tiny is an Understatement','I stayed here for two weeks, and I was never able to get over the size of the rooms - however, the staff was top-notch and the maid service was amazing. The hotel grounds left too much to be desired to justify the rate they charge.\r\n While checking in on my first night, you have to yell to be able to hear the front-desk staff because of the club music blaring in the backround. I was tired and ready for bed, and was very surprised to learn that the first floor lobby basically turns into an uber-chic club after dark. (Maker\'s Mark on ice was $16). \r\n When I walked into my standard room, I was expecting small, but what I got was TINY!!! I understand that Manhattan, on average, has smaller rooms than anywhere else in the U.S. (about 265 sq. ft), but this place is ridiculous! I measured the room for my own amusement and was tickled when I learned the whole room (bathroom, bedroom, closet, hallway) was 140 square feet!!!! \r\n If you ever have to use the toilet, your knees will touch the opposite wall when you sit down - and I\'m only 5\'9. If you are above average height, then you will have to literally fold yourself in half when you use the bathroom. Another thing that baffled me was you can\'t open the front door if the bathroom door is open... and vice versa. I kept thinking how ridiculous it would have been to have TWO people in the same room - don\'t even think about it!\r\nOverall, the Hudson was a decent hotel... very stuck-on-itself and very costly, but the location and guest service were above average. I\'m staying at the Marriott Marquis next time and was very pleased to hear that their standard rooms are about 425 square feet.'
5,'Location, Location, Location','This hotel isn\'t near Times Square, it IS Times Square. As others have reviewed, this hotel is massive and extremely busy, Just like NYC! We had a corner King on the 39th floor. The room, fitness center, and overall lobby and atrium appearance were excellent. Check in and check out were quick and efficient. Despite the size and activity, rooms were relaxing and quiet. You have access to everything at this location. Theaters, Tours, food, and public transportation. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. \r\nNow for a total contradiction. I stayed here for free by cashing in some hard earned Marriott Reward Points. The Marquis was the same point total as some lesser marriott\'s in the area so it made sense. Would I spend $400-$500 a night of my money to stay here? The answer is no. There are some less expensive marriotts as well as other hotel\'s that would suffice just as well. \r\nIt is impossible to stay anywhere in Manhattan and not be convenient to transportation, food, and some sort of vibrant area or activity. If budget is a concern don\'t be fixated on having to be in a specific area of manhattan, you can access everything fairly easily. Also, You\'ll spend very little time in the room anyway.'
5,'First time in NYC-the perfect hotel!','We spent marathon weekend in NYC-our first trip to the big apple-and stayed at the Edison Hotel. What a perfect place-can\'t recommend it highly enough. The location was too good to be true for us first timers. We were steps from the Red Steps on Times Square and mere minutes from all the wonderful restaurants and bars in hell\'s kitchen. We were able to stroll up Broadway, stopping for bagels and coffee, to see the excitement of the marathon at Central Park on Sunday and then walk a few blocks to the Today show on Monday to meet the cast up close and personal! The hotel room was extremely clean-no bed bugs here!-and comfortable with a small writing desk, and armoire and a very nice bathroom. We were able to check in early and were very pleased at the security measures for our luggage (on check out) and at the elevator bank since we aren\'t big city folks! We loved the art deco and period decor in the lobby and gathering area. So convenient, so clean, so ready to welcome us to the great city that is New York. Don\'t look elsewhere-the Hotel Edison is perfect.'
3,'Hotel Rating','Considering that I got a discount on this hotel, I was quite happy. It was still very expensive for me at over $200 a night but the location was perfect. The service was good. The personnel was helpful and friendly enough. The bed was clean and comfortable. It was directly across from Penn Station, which meant a lot to me since we (my granddaughter & I) caught the train; also, we were within walking distance to Times Square, Broadway and the Theater district. My stay here was just fine and I recommend this hotel. Just don\'t expect a modern look, or clean & fresh hallways, etc. The rugs are old and dirty and the rooms are small but this New York City. All the hotels close to everything are old and much used. They let us check in early and store our bags after checkout until our train was due (for a small cost). It was a great stay and a wonderful vacation.'
1,'BIG problems','My experience here was a nightmare. I depend on internet access (which they advertised) for my job. This is where I had my largest problem. First, it\'s $20 per day for internet access (even to browse the internet in the business center you have to pay $5 - $10). Second, if something goes wrong and you can\'t access the internet, do not expect them to help you. I was given an user name that didn\'t work, and the management had absolutely no idea what to do to help me. Nor did the technical support staff. I spent 2 1/2 hours on a Monday morning desperately trying to get access to the internet (all I needed was a user name that worked!) to no avail - and the management acted like I was imposing on them by asking for help. The manager even said I\'m not a technical person! - as if I was SOL and was on my own to try to figure it out. You would think that a hotel of this size with frequent business travelers would be prepared to respond if a guess had a username that didn\'t work.\r\nAs for the room itself, the floor I stayed on reeked of smoke, despite the fact that this is supposedly a non-smoking hotel. Guest services had a humidifier sent up to help with the smell, but the fan in the humidifier was noticeably covered in mold and dirt. It was almost offensive that they would send it up to me in that state.\r\nThe room was also noisy and tired. You can tell that they are not bothering to put much money into updating the rooms (TV, carpet, furniture cheap and old).\r\nThere are some things about the hotel that are good, but they do not quite redeem it for me. First, the rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. You can order from a menu of different pillow types. The room service is from a restaurant in the hotel that is not bad (which is saying a lot when it comes to room service in a hotel of this caliber). I asked for a DVD player to play my yoga DVD and they brought it right up and set it up for me.\r\nIN SUM, I would say that the only reason to stay in this hotel would be if you got a VERY good rate. It\'s not worth the rate I was paying - nearly $300 per night. I transfered to The Kintano after my internet issue and it is SOOOO much nicer (let me reiterate -- SOOOO muuuuch niiicer), for the same price!!!\r\nShop around and only stay in the Affinia if it is the cheapest option and you won\'t depend on internet.'
5,'I LOVE NY!','What a location, it\'s so central to everything you would want to see in NY! The rooms are small but clean, you only sleep & shower there anyway.There\'s a lovely king size bed, and we had a great view of 42nd street from our window. We walked everywhere from the Hyatt. Concierge are wonderful, so helpful with anything you want to see & do. \r\nThe lobby for store is great for snacks, you\'re given vouchers for free bottled water and tea/coffee.\r\nLet\'s not forget Grand Central Terminal, there\'s a great food hall in there too.\r\nI don\'t say \'if\' I go back,it\'s \'when\' I go back, and the Grand Hyatt will be my accomodation when I go back to the Big Apple!'
4,'A great first NYC experience','We stayed here over a long weekend in early April \'08. Check in was fast and stress-free (there was a line when we arrived but it moved quickly) and the staff was very welcoming. Our room was ready right away (well before the official check in time), and was clean and spacious, very little to argue with there. \r\nThere\'s several food options there if you feel like staying in at any point on your trip -- we ate at the restaurant on the top floor (which was decent but expensive), as well as one of the restaurants on a lower floor for breakfast and the lounge for drinks (again, both were good and the revolving lounge is fun, but both, like many places in NYC, are a little pricey.) \r\nThe location is a huge selling point for this place and for first-timers in NYC like we were it was a good place to be based (you have Times Square obviously right outside your door, and we were able to easily walk to a lot of sights like the Museum of Modern Art -- but keep in mind that we are both healthy young adults with no children so your mileage may vary.) Getting to the subway from the hotel was also easy. \r\nThe only thing I can\'t really comment on is the price of the room, since we were able to stay mostly on Marriott rewards program points and therefore got a really good deal. \r\nAll in all, I would book this place with confidence and recommend it to others.'
4,'I liked it','The room was very small it was our 5th anniversary and my husband has never been to NewYork even though it was rainy we enjoyed Time Square and of course I enjoyed tthe shopping'
5,'Excellent hotel !!!!','We stayed in this hotel for our 40th birthday treat. I have only complements to pay to the staff,who were friendly and helpful.Our room was a studio suite with two double beds which had to be the most comfortable I have ever slept in a hotel.The room was clean and on the 16th floor we didn`t suffer noise problems.\r\nThe bathroom are small but functional and cleaned to a high standard.\r\nThe location was excellent.\r\nI loved New York and will return with my family next time and I will stay at this value for money Hotel. \r\nThanks to the staff who provide for thier excellent service.'
4,'Excelente Atención y Ubicación','Ubicado justo en el centro de Manhathan, diagonal a una de las Estaciones principales de Subway donde llegan las conexiones de Metro y Trenes desde y hacia los aeropuertos, NJ y 3 de las líneas principales del subway que te llevan a todo NY. Tienes Starbucks en frente, varios sitios de comida rápida, el Madison Square, el Empire States a 3 cuadras y las tiendas de electronicos mas económicas de NY. Las habitaciones son acogedoras. Lo unico es que el Wi Fi es muy costoso y no te colocan agua en las habitaciones.'
2,BRRRR,'Beautiful presentation as you walk in; given a room, we immediately had to change. Airconditioner in window, no insulation around air conditioner or around window frame and the wind was coming in next to the bed. It was freezing. So we were given a different room This one was newly remodeled (why didn\'t they give us that one to begin with? ) and this one also had the air conditioner in the window BUT it was placed near the soft, so you would only feel cold while watching TV sitting on the sofa; heater worked well by the way. Kitchenette was WONDERFUL...microwave, STOVE, frig, amazing; 2 beds, soft, teeny bathroom...very very teeny....... but the air conditioners in the windows with NO INSULATION is a problem for staying there in the WINTER. We did get a good price for one night for this huge studio...$195 tax incl. ...; it was central to everything...macy\'s, rockerfeller ctr...we walked, no taxis needed. NILES their hotel restaurant is relaxing with its lighting and colors and we enjoyed breakfast there. Also I want to mention that the Affinia sent their own evaluation form and actually read it, responded to me, and said they would put insulation in the windows and that they appreciated my honesty.'
5,'Great Times square hotel','Stayed here 5 nights on an NYC visit. This is a very clean, modern and comfortable hotel. Location is good for Times Square. The staff I dealt with were great and the facilities excellent. The room value is good but the only thing I would have against is the bar is a little pricey for hotel class, but it was V GOOD wine!'
2,'non ne vale la pena','ci sono stato questa estate e nella hall erano in corso dei lavori di ristrutturazione che non hanno impedito alla catena alberghiera di tenere alti i costi delle camere.\r\nLa camera è molto piccola in stile newyorkese, ma sul bagno si sono superati.\r\nIn piedi e con le braccia larghe riuscivo a toccare le pareti.\r\nPersonale del tutto inesistente. C\'è solo se lo vai a cercare e non è certamente il massimo della cortesia.\r\nSinceramente per 400 dollari a notte è un furto.'
2,'Perfecta ubicación, terrible hotel','El hotel tiene una ubicación inmejorable, en pleno centro de Manhattan frente al Madison Square Garden, lo que te permite ir a todas partes caminando y regresar a cualquier hora. Es una edificación enorme que se nota tuvo su buena época, pero ahora se encuentra descuidado. Las habitaciones apestan a cigarro, baños viejos y de dudosa limpieza.\r\nIgualmente todo se olvida cuando paseas por esta ciudad espectacular.'
3,'Great location','I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The location was central to subway locations, Broadway Theaters and restaurants. The WiFi was ultra expensive at nearly $20 a day with multiple taxes tagged on to the price of $16.95. The rooms were decent, nothing to fancy, and there were two Starbucks on the property. The elevator system can be a little confusing. Had many people get on not knowing you have to push the floor number on one of the keypads before entering the assigned elevator. The hotel bar is a total wast of $9 to just get in. Save your money. The view isn\'t spectacular. The hotel was also close to Hell\'s Kitchen which is full of local favorite dining spots so if you want to avoid the chains, this area is a close walk to 9th Ave.'
2,'Could be so much better','The Hudson Hotel in NYC looks so good - but the reality is that it is badly let (and lit) down in comparison to other boutique hotels I\'ve stayed at.\r\nFirstly though, the one big compliment. With the exception of a doorman who I found to be rude (not to me but to the taxis of NYC which didn\'t ensure a smooth ride anywhere!) the staff were very good. From reception, to the breakfast guys to security and cleaners - though they did try to get in three times whilst I was either trying to go to the loo or shower. Thankfully the room is so small you can stop access pretty quickly!\r\nHowever, the problem is there are more downsides then ups. Aside from breakfast (which I\'ll come on to later), there was absolutely no food available in the hotel aside from vending machines on each floor. The one or ours appeared to be turned off, and the drinks one took my three dollars and wouldn\'t give it back when it eventually said there was no drinks available. You couldn\'t even get a cup of coffee or a cup or tea - no in-room facilities - at the very least, you should be able to get a warm drink!\r\nBreakfast was very over-priced for what it was - and unfortunately, a booking error meant that we ended up paying for this (not The Hudson\'s error admittedly). The food is served in the library on the pool table and constists of fruit, yoghurt, hard-boiled eggs, bread rolls and a few pastries. One of which, is discovered far too late, appeared to be date and walnut! It didn\'t make for a comfortable return home to Heathrow I can assure you.\r\nBack to the rooms and both me and my parents had problems with them. Mum and Dad had to change rooms after it was discovered to be impossible to open the cupboards as the builders had put the door on the wrong side of the cupboards making them inoperable. They didn\'t have a fridge either (which wasn\'t on anyway when you got one), so they changed rooms. The rooms are tiny - from the bed I was able to touch both walls without too much difficulty. When you add cases, ironing boards and such like there isn\'t a lot of room to play with. From the bed you can see right through to the bathroom via the shower - might be nice with the right people, but do you really want to see someone else sitting on the toilet? Not a particularly nice thought!\r\nI had a problem with my safe - quickly sorted admittedly - while our tv\'s both needed attention. In the end it became quicker to deal with it ourselves but should guests really have to unplug and then plug their tv\'s back in when they return at night?\r\nThe rooms were noisy with the city life below which can\'t be helped - but the heavy doors were also very easily slammed. When you living that close to each other, you can hear it very quickly. Indeed, my mother suggested that she\'d always wanted to know how it felt like to be in prison.....well, now she knew.\r\nIn short, with a little bit more love and attention, The Hudson could be a very good boutique hotel, ideally situated near the subway and Central Park on Colombus Circle. At present though, it fails to hit the mark on far too many targets. If you\'re claustrophobic in any way - don\'t even bother.'
5,'Affinia Manhattan, immer wieder sehr gerne!','Wir waren nun zum wiederholten Male im Affinia Manhattan. Unserer Meinung ist dieses charmante Hotel einfach Klasse. Die günstige Lage, direkt gegenüber der Penn Station, macht dieses Hotel noch angenehmer. Die Bediensteten waren, wie immer, sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Sauberkeit der Zimmer ist dank sehr guten Personals ausgezeichnet. Wir hatten ein Studio mit Terrasse im 24. Stock mit Blick auf das Metlife Building und auf die Spitze des Empire State Buildings. Auch das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis ist für New York ok. Und deshalb immer wieder gerne das Affinia Manhattan.'
1,'Never Again','Last July, a friend and I spent a fun weekend in NYC. Fun at least until we saw the hotel. \r\nI\'m from Massachusetts so I travel to NYC quite often. On this occasion in July we stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania. BIG mistake! It is undoubtly the worse hotel I\'ve ever stayed in anywhere. I\'d say it\'s one step up from a Motel 6 roadside hotel. \r\nThe hotel is large, busy, and walking distance to everything but that was no consolation compared to the quality (or lack thereof) of this place. We were put on a floor that had not been renovated. It felt like we were in the movie The Shining. I would not have been surprised to see Jack Nicholson walking down the long, dark, dreary, dirty halls yelling here\'s Johnnie. They put us in a room that looked as if we stepped back into the 1930s! The room had two cots (not even ral beds) and green wool army type blankets on the cots. The curtins were filthy and the bathroom NASTY! We ended up going to the management and DEMANDING they put us in a real room. If at all possible, stay away from this hotel!!!!!'
4,'Great location, impressive customer service','Stayed for 3 nights in a standard double room with two of my girly mates in late Feb 2011. NY followed crazy 4 days in Vegas so we were looking for a little R&R and a chance to catch up with some friends in our fave city. Booked through Asda travel, around £150 per night in total which we thought was pretty reasonable for 3 people midweek. We were allocated a room on the 25th floor.\r\nFirst with the positives:\r\n- Room very clean\r\n- Considering this was a standard double, I actually thought the main room was not a bad size for NYC (remember we had 3 adult women sharing). We had enough space for three large suitcases on the floor without killing ourselves walking about the room. Bathroom small but perfectly formed.\r\n- Hotel in middle of refurb and we were on a brand new floor. I thought it looked great and lots of nice decorations in the hallway. This did lead to our only complaint though (see below).\r\n- The one complaint we did make (see below regarding the refurb noise), was dealt with superbly - immediate unqualified apology and $100 comp\'d to our room to spend on dinner. Nice touch and although the issue we had was very annoying - it was enough to help us forget about it and get on with the holiday.\r\n - Hotel is in a really great location. 10min walk to Times Square, right next door to Grand Central, and fab delhis on Lex. Really couldn\'t hear much noise from outside.\r\n - 5 Mins tops to check in and out and only a short wait to leave our luggage with the bell desk on our last day ($2 per bag charge)\r\n - Liked the buzzy feel in the very grand lobby - makes you feel like you\'re really in the thick of it which I think people look for in NYC.\r\n - Fab service in the restuarant at dinner - very attentive red head who was charming and provided fautless service\r\n - Nice view from 25th floor\r\nNow with the not so good:\r\n- Only one restaurant in the hotel and the food was VERY rich (a little too much for our pallette). I\'m sure when I stayed here before there was more choice and a cocktail bar ?\r\n- Mattresses were so soft that two of us had bad backs in the morning. Our other friend who is the only one to sleep on her side had no problem. Guess bed firmness a very personal preference and dependent on the way you sleep!\r\n- Refurb work was being done on the 26th floor immediately above us. We were woken up on our first day at 7am and honestly thought someone was about to come through the floor. Sounded like very loud dragging sound and very noisy banging. It was continuous so we couldn\'t go back to sleep after 7am :-( \r\nExactly the same on morning 2 and we\'d had enough. I phoned the front desk and as I mentioned above - they offered what I considered fair compensation and if we insisted I think they would also have moved us. We said don\'t worry as we had to get up early on the last day anyway and were more than happy with the way they handled it.\r\nI really thought the service in the Grand Hyatt was great - I think that says so much more about a hotel than the official star rating. Have stayed here a few times now and would definitely go back - no question.'
5,'Top service','een heel leuk en goed hotel met heel vriendelijk personeel. Ook zeer behulpzaam. Mooie en schone kamers, met computer. heerlijk om voor een city trip naar New York te slapen.\r\nAlles is op loop afstand en de metro is vlakbij.'
1,Nul,'Cet hôtel est certes très bien situé à quelques pas de times square, mais point de vue chambre : un simple lit double (taille française), la salle de bain petite, comme la chambre était devant l\'ascenseur j\'avais le bruit de la sonnette d\'arrivée des ascenseurs à l\'étage, des problèmes d\'insonorisation (une fenêtre était avec un autocollant do not touch), ils n\'avaient pas réparé et on aurait cru que la rue était dans la chambre et la nuit il y a beaucoup de bruit (les sirènes des véhicules d\'urgence, les camions qui font je ne sais quoi à 2 h du mat\'...), pourtant j\'étais au 15è étage, le matelas était trop mou, décoration de chambre très très vieille, le café édison tout aussi vieux que l\'hôtel, petit et la queue le matin pour le petit dej, le personnel de l\'hôtel pas le plus sympa du monde, le storage luggage où il faillait payer (bon c\'est que 50 cents). Par contre le restaurant Sofia\'s avec une entrée dans l\'hôtel était très bien. Je rêvais d\'aller prendre une chambre au marriott marquis qui était juste en face...'
4,'Good hotel at a great location','After a colleague recommended The Westin NY at Times Square 6 years ago, this has been my preferred hotel in New York City. I have stayed at The Westin many times and the last time I went with my fiance. The rooms are clean and the beds very comfortable. Unfortunately the heavenly shower disappeared the last time I check-in. The hotel is located right in the middle of the action: Times Square and Broadway and still within an acceptable walking distance to Central Park. museums and some great department stores.'
3,'The hotel is old and not up to date clares to The price','Dont visit The topfloor lounge. Too expensive and no information about extra fee for view. The view is bad compared to other places NYC'
4,'Great for the price','Priceline chose this hotel for me when I decided to book a trip to NYC just 3 days ahead of traveling. I paid $180/night before taxes and was not disappointed. The location was great, being connected to Grand Central. The lobby was gorgeous, all decorated for the holidays. \r\nMy queen room was just fine for me (I was alone). The bed was comfy, it was very quiet (I was far from the elevators), and the shower was hot. The bathroom was not the nicest I\'ve seen..........a little dated........but clean enough. I could not help noticing black mold in the grout of the tub but, like I said, it was dated. \r\nThe concierge was helpful and friendly when I asked for directions and the front desk staff were cheerful when I asked them to make change for large bills on 2 occasions.\r\nI did not order room service, nor did I eat in their restaurants so I can\'t comment on that. I\'d recommend this hotel just for location but it might not be worth paying $400/night as their website is now quoting. Just my opinion.'
4,'Central Location','Stayed here for 8 nights so I feel we gave this hotel a good shot. Our check in was smooth even though we had to do it ourself. This might put some people off as it is similar to airport self check in - hit and miss. As for the room - overall quite pleasantly decorated but missing an item I would consider essential - coffee maker. The 24 hour market in the lobby comes to the rescue but I guess it\'s the nuisance factor here. The pillows were numerous but way too soft as was the bed. I don\'t understand why so many hotels are using pillow top beds - they sag on the sides where people constantly sit. (I am a firm mattress advocate.)\r\nThe hotel is very busy - every 2nd evening there seemed to be an event in the lobby or the ballroom. These were big affairs and they impacted on the elevators and added to the general noise level within the hotel.\r\nThe location is the reason we decided to stay here - being right at Grand Central was the deciding factor and the subway was well used by us.'
5,'Just loved it and will be back for sure','The service was super, and the room was perfect nice bed.... you couldn`t wish for a better location.'
3,'Cher pour la taille minuscule de la chambre','Le lobby est très somptueux, la déco des chambres par Stark est réussie mais la taille des chambres est minuscule, \r\nLe service et la propreté laissent à désirer.\r\nLe rapport qualité-prix est décevant.'
3,'Great hotel - but beware of room allocation !!','I have stayed in this hotel many times with my husband and have always been extremely satisfied. It\'s in a prime location and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. However, we have just returned from a 4 night stay and were extremely disappointed with the check-in clerk. On arrival, we were asked if we wanted to pay extra to upgrade to a room with a better view of Times Square. Bearing in mind we had paid in excess of £1,600 for four nights and had always been happy with our previous rooms, we declined. We were allocated a room and could not believe what we saw. It was half the size of the rooms we had always stayed in before, overlooked a concrete roof and was dark, dingy and depressing. In addition it was right next to the elevators and ice machine (could it be in a worse position?) Any new visitors to this hotel would probably have thought this was what all their rooms were like !!! We immediately went back to see the same check-in clerk and told him we were not happy and wanted another room of a similar standard to what we have always stayed in before. Begrudingly he allocated a new room to us and lo and behold it was great. Without a shadow of a doubt, we are convinced this clerk deliberately gave us a sub-standard room because we declined to pay the extra to upgrade ! Such a shame as the hotel was great in every other way, but the Marriott need to sort out staff like this.'
3,'Not impressed at all, even for a plain old Hilton','I don\'t generally expect much from business-class hotels like the Hilton, but I had hoped for at least pleasant service.\r\nAt check-in, the front desk person would have been a perfect cast in iRobot. Not even a hint of a smile. No empathy. No anything. Front desk personnel are the face of the hotel. In this case, it was a very unsavory face indeed. Fine. So Mr Personality doesn\'t give me any indication my business is welcomed. Such is life.\r\nAt least we got rooms next to each other (we have two rooms). Oh, but not connecting, even though the floor map looks like there are connecting rooms. Ah well.\r\nThe room is small. Maybe not tiny by NYC standards, but I am glad we have 2 rooms. Bathrooms are small too. Only 2 bathtowels.\r\nThe heat/AC is one of those prehistoric ones controlled by the hotel, it seems. Either A.C or heat. It is December, so only heat, even though it\'s really warm. I even opened the windows as far as they would open. Set the thermostat to the lowest, and yet the room never got below 74 F. Not even in the middle of the night!\r\nHousekeeper did not even leave paper and pen in the room. How nice.\r\nThe iron in the room kept leaking water.\r\nAs Gold, I thought some kind of upgrade might be available. Or at least free breakfast. Well, I got 2 bottles of water and a coupon for a mid-size drink and a breakfast pastry. And a room 10 ft from the elevator on the HHONORS Floor. I can see Hilton really appreciates my business.\r\nI knew there was a reason why I chose to make PLT at SPG and Fairmont, and settled for Gold at Hilton. This stay just reminds me the reason why.'
2,'Pick a different hotel!','There were pros and cons of this hotel, but overall, I was dissapointed with the quality of the hotel and its management. I was apparently lucky enough to have a refurbished king bedroom, but I thought it was the older model because the wallpaper was already peeling off and the ipod dock was broken. There was no coffee or complimentary bottles of water in the room. Another reviewer wrote not to forget to ask for complimentary coffee and water from the cafe in the lobby...but I never knew to ask in the first place, so I paid for mine. The main issue we experienced was that there were hundreds of teenagers staying at the hotel for the duration of our 4 nights in NYC. They were running up and down the halls, yelling to each other, and slamming the doors from 10 pm - 4 am. The last night of our stay, patience gone, we called guest services to explain the situation and asked for someone to address the other guests. A manager came up to speak with the teens, but never followed up to make sure that they stayed quiet (they did NOT), nor did anyone follow up with us to check on the status of the issue or appologize. If I were managing the hotel, I would have made sure to monitor the noise level at night on each floor. I mean, there were hundreds of teens staying at the hotel, sharing rooms! It would have only taken quick walk-throughs every so often to make sure things weren\'t out of control while the teens were in lodging. Instead, I paid over $1200 to stay at a hotel between business meetings...and felt like I was staying in a dorm room or hostile. The food at the hotel was also ridiculously expensive. If anyone has ever been to Seoul, I can only equate their food prices to there...which is the most expensive city (food-wise) that I\'ve been to. If you eat at the hotel, you\'ll pay at least 2x, if not 3x what you\'ll pay on average in Manhattan.\r\nTIme for the positives! The bed was soft and comfortable. I was able to turn the lights off from bed...but only one of the 3 buttons worked. The shower head was large and the water pressure was good. The absolute best part was the location. \r\nExcellent location. I\'d recommend picking a different hotel close by! Manhattan is AMAZING with tons of options for lodging...I am sure one of them is managed a bit better than this one.'
3,'Great deal','Nice hotel, great location, friendly staff, check in and check out went smoothly, we timed it, there was long lines from 11:30am till late in the afternoon, valet was smooth and they had are car out in 15 minutes, the room was great considering that this was the cheaest hotel in Manhatten. We loved the dog friendly, no additional charge feature. We would stay here again.'
4,'vivere Ny','l\'Hotel è in una posizione perfetta. E\' a 5 minuti da Time Square, dalal quinta e da tutte le principali attrazioni, non distante da central park. E\' in una zona tranquilla ed accogliente, si respira veramente l\'aria della citta. \r\nha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Consigliato!!!'
4,'new york wow hotel great x','We paid around $100 a night and well worth it. Check in at 3pm was not able to do this earlier but rooms to drop your bags. Check in was quick and easy. No safe in the room but apparently they have them behind reception. The room was tiny but cleaned every day. Shower was great clean towels every day. The beds are so comfy Free wifi. Heating and AC are quick and easy to use. We also only left 2 hours to get the plane back, we should of left 3 ! the hotel quickly booked a cab and told them to rush! we made it phew ! cab from JFK was $55 and back to newark was $80. Tick tock diner was right next door and open 24hrs, this was good quick service but not fussy. You have to show your key to get in the lift which i thought was a great security thing. Gym was great. Penn subway 2 mins walk away and this is a great way to get around $2.50 to get most places. (I was scared about going thougt it would be horrid down there but it isnt at all) Hotel right near Macys (the give 10\% off for being a visitor so take your boarding ticket or passport) and the empire state building. If you want to go to the statue of liberty book months in advance to go up to the crown as it gets booked up months in advance. We tried to plan our trip but the best advice we were givern was to just go with the flow and enjoy thats what we did, it was great. Great designer outlet shop called centery 21 (472 86TH) near groud zero and it is cheap as chips. A must if you are shopping. The rockafella center also a must fab views and the best was going to see chicargo on broad way breath taking x 2 great reatarants The rocking horse cafe 182 Eighth Ave (at 19th St),( mexican food) and Becco 355 W 46th St (Italian) Both have great food, service and atmosphire and for the two of us including drink was around $70. Becco also made sure that our food was quick so we were able to make our show. So all in all cant wait to go again only been back a day and want to book would def stay there again. Enjoy your hols.'
4,'Great Old Hotel','Beautiful, historic old hotel on in the Loop. Lobby is huge, busy--a good place to sit, read, people watch and have a conversation with a friend. Restaurant was good (I only had breakfast and a lunch there.) Decent well-staffed concierge service. Room was well appointed. Terrible view--if you care about that, ask for a room with a view. Plenty of towels and a tub/shower that was comfortable and easy to get in and out of (Im not a kid and that matters these days.) On the second day of a three-day stay, the safe malfunctioned. The initial response was good, but they neglected to get it to work for my last day there which was inconvenient.'
2,'La prima impressione buona la camera un po\' meno!','Hall bella e molto raffinata. (pulita!)\r\nPersonale poco cordiale, sul bancone del check-in offrivano delle mele talmente lucide da far pensare che l\'hotel ci tiene alla pulizia...mah?!\r\nArrivati in camera abbiamo trovato il bagno sporco. I muri talmente sottili che sentivamo le persone della camera vicina parlare.\r\nGiornata successiva al ritorno in hotel: bagno apparentemente pulito peccato che ci fossero ancora dei capelli per terra!!!! Davanti a noi abbiamo ancora due giorni...speriamo bene!\r\nConnessione Internet a pagamento, per fortuna c\'è il vicino starbucks che ha il wifi free. Questi del park central sono proprio dei taccagni!\r\nPosizione centralissima niente da dire! \r\nDavanti all\'hotel c\'è un mega pupazzo a forma di talpa...dove vi è scritto che i letti di questo hotel hanno degli acari della polvere o qualcosa di simile...noi al momento siamo ancora salvi da becchi strani...speriamo di lasciare questo hotel illesi! \r\nSicuramente non torneremo. \r\nNon sono una persona schizzinosa ma il minimo indispensabile della pulizia mi sembra che sia d\'obbligo'
5,'Überdurchschnittlich gut','Wir waren eine Woche in dem Hotel und ich muss sagen, dass dieses Hotel ein super Preis/-Leistungs-Verhältnis bietet. Die Zimmer sind für New Yorker-Verhältnisse sehr geräumig. Die King-Size-Betten sind bequem. Aus dem 24. Stockwerk (Unser Hotelzimmer) hatte man eine tadellose Aussicht auf das Empire State Building. \r\nService:\r\nDie Frau an der Rezeption war äußerst nett, sie gab uns Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt und bei Problemen war sie sofort zur Stelle.\r\nFrühstück:\r\nDas Essen selbst haben wir nicht ausprobiert, da wir in der Metropole lieber selbst in Delis unser Frühstück holen wollten. \r\nLage: Das Hotel liegt fast gegenüber vom Madison Square Garden mit der Penn Station, die mit der Subway den Großraum New York bedient. Auch zu Fuß ist man innerhalb von 10 Minuten am Times Square, von dem man, wenn man aus dem Hotel geht, schon Teile erkennen kann.\r\nFazit:\r\nich werde bei meinem nächsten Besuch wieder das gleiche Hotel besuchen, da es einen für New York sehr guten Preis hat. Hier wird auch der Service großgeschrieben und die Lage gefällt mir in diesem Hotel mit am Besten.'
4,'Second visit to the Westin','This was our second stay at the Westin. We\'re from the UK, and tagged this visit onto the end of a trip to Las Vegas to attend my sister\'s wedding. Due to someone thinking it was amusing [using my words advisedly here] to deliberately block the toilets with toilet paper on the aeroplane for our internal flight, we didn\'t arrive at the hotel until 3am in the morning. Despite our unintended late arrival, the receptionist was bright, breezy and efficient. We were on the 10th floor, not much of a view, but the room met our needs. Housekeeping didn\'t seem to be particularly generous this time with shower gels etc. Good job we had plenty of our own. \r\nDidn\'t have any meals at the hotel, so much choice around NY. Only had one drink in the bar, and it was more expensive than other bars we went to, however felt this hotel isn\'t particularly catering solely for the tourist end of the market, more a combination of tourists and business people.\r\nThis was our third visit to NY. I like this hotel as it\'s central, the beds are comfortable and you have room service every day. I don\'t recall seeing any children there this time. I am a parent, but at my age don\'t particularly want to be around young children. Been there, done that. It seems more suited to business people or adult tourists.'
5,'unexpected pleasure','After issues in my planned hotel, I checked in at midnight to the Westin, Time Square. A Warm party-like reception, with a polite and educated lady on reception; I was checked in swiftly, provided an immaculate and well thought through room. Hard to believe I was in the middle of one of the busiest spots in NY. The staff could not have done more, and the facilities could not have been better...'
4,'Clean comfortable stay in central location near everything in NYC','In summary we enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker Hotel. Room was very small and limited cupboard space to put clothes for 2 persons but overall a very modern room and extremely comfortable bed with high quality bedding. We heard no one\'s voices in neighbouring rooms only heard people in hallway as they passed the room but no big deal. Nice flat screen TV on wall mounted in front of bed made nighttime watching TV comfortable. We opened the window on our 23rd floor room to get breeze rather than running AC all the time. Bathroom very small with very little space to leave toiletries but overall everything was operational with good shower pressure albeit the temperature never got too hot so I just ran the hot water which was warm enough for our showers. Nice towels and replenished soaps, lotions, shampoos mid way through our stay. Location of hotel is just around corner of the 34th St./Penn Station Subway stop and across road from Pennsylvania Main Rail station. Macy\'s is 2 large blocks away and Empire state Building is 3 large blocks away but all walkable. We walked lots and lots and used the 1 week Metro pass costing just $27 which was a great value. Times Square is 1 metro stop away and was awesome too. The Tick Tock Diner is located directly next door to hotel which was a great diner to catch daily breakfasts and lunches at and they are open 24 hours/day. Hotel doesn\'t offer room service but most local restaurants will deliver to your room if you want to stay in now and again. I do recommend the New Yorker as I do think it offers good value for the money due to cleanliness of rooms, bed, location and service of the staff.'
5,'Spot on!','Very nice hotel, all the staff were very friendly towards us.\r\nWe had a studio room and were expecting something that you could just walk around the bed, but our room was huge for manhattan rooms and the price.\r\nMaureen on the concierge desk was especially helpful on several occasions for booking tickets and general advice. She knows her stuff!\r\nVery well placed hotel in terms of transport links.\r\nWe had e-mailed in advance to ask for a room on a high floor and are needs were catered to.\r\nWould recommend going to Ginger House for some food if you like chinese food, its across the street and down one block i think. Very good food.\r\nwould easily go back to this hotel again!'
5,'Hotel Penn-great find!','This hotel is across from Macy\'s. It may be a little walk from times square but this hotels clean rooms,friendly staff and great price more than make up for a little hike.My friend and I would definately stay here again in the future!'
3,'Great location - tiny bedrooms','Having stayed at this hotel in early September as part of the 1st leg of a 2 week holiday to USA, I will be frank with you all. Having read previous reviews it is true the hotel is in dire need of updating as it looks like something from the early 1900\'s in places and as for the bedrooms - you could not swing a cat in the double bedroom we were allocated. However having said that for location you cannot beat it - 1 min from times square and all Broadway a stones throw away. Staff were very courteous & helpful, change of towels, room cleaned & bed made ever day, so it ain\'t all that bad & a more than acceptable place to plonk yourself when visiting New York - after all you don\'t come to NYC to stay in your hotel for too long so for value for money & location turn a blind eye to the negatives because in this hotel the positives out weigh the negs.'
1,diabolical,'hotel was in complete chaos when we checked in. door key did not work when we tried to enter room, and was told by staff member to treat the lock like a woman, and coax it gently.. on entering room and pulling bedspread down there was an ink stain below it and the sheets were grubby and looked as though the previous occupant had just left.the porters were arguing with eachother in front of me as if I didn\'t exist. we checked out straight away.I would only recomend this hotel too my worst enemy.'
4,'Excellent location','I staid 7 days, It has an excellent location. Good staff service. No problems. Only issue, the elevator has no A/C, and the shower hasn´t very much pressure. The restaurante for breakfast needs a renovation. I will stay again.'
4,'Marriott Marquis, NYC, the place to be','It was a nice hotel, but not the best. The room wasn\'t as clean as I thought it would be. My clock was very dusty, see picture attached. There was a stain on my carpet. My ice bucket had melted ice from the last visitor(s). The elevators were a little confusing. It\'s hard to figure out which elevator you go on to get to the right floor.\r\nMarriott Marquis was nice, especially its location. I\'d come back if I could, but I would hope for a little better and/or cleaner room.'
5,'Cant be wrong','Stayed at the Hilton this November - Thanksgiving Day parade was underway 1 block away. Awesome weather, great location what can go wrong?\r\nIf you stay at the Hilton, not much… I was upgraded to top floor, got free executive lounge entrance. If only the upper floors elevators were OK, it was perfect. The way they were Ill give it a 9.7 out of 10.\r\nWill be back!'
4,Toplage,'Das Grand Hyatt befindet sich an bester Lage! Direkt am Grand Central. Von dort aus ist man schnell an den grossen Einkaufsstrassen, kann sämtliche Transportmittel nutzen. Der Flughafenshuttle liegt gleich gegenüber dem Hotel, was ein Vorteil ist.\r\nDie Gegend um den Grand Central ist auch nachts sehr sicher, weil hier überall Polizei steht.\r\nEssen ist alle paar Meter erhältlich.\r\n Das Hotel selber ist super modern erneuert worden. In der Hotelhalle ist schön kühl. Der Check-in ist schnell. Ich habe ein Zimmer erhalten, das mir eine miserable Sicht bot. Ich habe dann freundlich um ein Zimmer mit schöner Aussicht gebeten und gleich umziehen können. Das ging problemlos und schnell. \r\nDas Hotel ist gut gegen Lärm isoliert und daher sehr ruhig. Ich habe in NY schon Anderes erlebt.\r\nIn der Lobby gibt es einen kleinen Markt, der Snacks bietet.\r\nDie Zimmer sind für New York recht gross. Alles ist mit Hightech ausgestattet. Bei manchen Sachen musste ich erstmal ausprobieren wie es funktioniert, zum Bsp. die Dusche, Lichtschalter etc. Die Betten sind super bequem. Die Wand ist mit moderner, stilvoller Kunst bemalt, was eine besondere Atmosphäre ergab.\r\nBei der Zimmerreinigung würde ich einen Abzug machen. Da ich ja zwei Zimmer gesehen hatte und beide keinen sauberen Badezimmerboden hatten, ist das wohl nicht unbedingt Zufall.\r\nIch kann das Grand Hyatt auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen.'
4,'Ottima posizione!','Un Hotel sostanzialmente nella media, ma merita un plus per la posizione. A due passi da Times Square e da Broadway muovendoci a sud, vicinissimo a Central Park andando verso nord. Per chi desidera visitare NYC un alloggio perfetto. Personale molto gentile e disponibile: parlavano italiano e appena vi è stata la possibilità ci hanno cambiato stanza portandoci a qualche piano superiore... dalla nostra finestra, affacciata sulla strada principale potevamo vedere in lontananza le luci di Times Square. Io penso che il rapporto qualità prezzo sia ottimo. Ho in programma una seconda capatina nella Big Apple e tornerò senz\'altro al Park Central!'
5,'Location, Location, Location!!!','This is my headquarters for the complete NYC experience when I am in the city.\r\nGreat value when you consider you get Hilton quality combined with good size rooms and a location that is ideal for the tourist and business traveler too.'
5,'great location !','The location of this hotel is fantastic. It\'s just a few meters from Grand Central Terminal. \r\nPrice is not so good, but this is NYC !\r\nThe room is small, but well decorated and clean; comfortable beds/pillows.\r\nHotel charges for wireless Internet access in the room.'
4,'the perfect location for visiting Manhattan','Three of us stayed in the very nice sized room. We were impressed by the size and felt we received good value for the price we paid compared to other Manhattan hotels. The location is just perfect and in the center of it all.'
5,'Great place for a tourist!','In the heart of NY, this hotel is great for tourists, assuming its in your budget. The room was contemporary, clean and comfortable. The checkin / checkout took a long time and the staff was pretty stale.\r\nNone the less, I had a great and comfy sleep!'
4,'Piacevole soggiorno','Ambiente moderno ed elegante. Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 5 notti in una camera che, tra l\'altro, aveva un piccolo soggiorno con divano e poltrona, un angolo cottura e due armadi. Forse proprio per la presenza dell\'angolo cottura non c\'era frigo bar (poco importa!), ma c\'erano asse e ferro da stiro, asciugacapelli ed ovviamente a/c.\r\nUnica nota stonata un po\' di polvere qua e la negli armadi ed il soffione della doccia fisso, quindi la signora dovrà mettersi la cuffietta! ;-)\r\nNel complesso siamo stati molto bene anche perchè il suo punto di forza è la posizione. Si arriva dall\'aeroporto JFK direttamente a Penn Station, praticamente difronte all\'hotel ed al Madison Square Garden. Vicinissimo a Time Square, all\'Empire ed ai magazzini Macy\'s.'
4,'Unschlagbar durch Preis und Lage!','Zunächst einmal.... wer jetzt nicht unbedingt das Four Seasons oder das Astoria Walldorf besuchen kann, muss in NY Abstriche machen. Der New Yorker Hotelstandard hat wenig mit Luxus zu tun, was allerding auch einen gewissen Charme hat. So auch das Pennsylvania. Von außen top, auch die Hotellobby ist atemberaubend. Die Zimmer (wir wohnten in angeblich renovierten Zimmern) waren zunächst eine kleine Enttäuschung: alte Teppiche, Tapete blättert ab, Keramik der Badewann aufgesprungen etc.... OK, da muss man kurz schlucken. Nichtsdestotrotz, wer so wie wir die Nacht zum Tage macht in einer Stadt, die niemals schläft, braucht auch nicht mehr als ein sauberes Bett und eine Toplage, die unschlagbar ist, direkt an der Pennstation, eine Station zu Port Authoritx, 2 zur GrandCentral Station. der Times Square in 5-10 Minuten zu erreichen, ausreichende Bars im Viertel, was will man da mehr?'
5,'Strangely Considerate of Toddlers','We landed the Hudson Hotel on a Priceline whim after deciding to escape from Thanksgiving family drama. Got in for $115 including taxes - a steal, considering it was the holiday weekend.\r\nThere\'s decent garage parking nearby, so you don\'t have to pay the valet. It\'s kind of hard to find the front door, but once you get over your MIB-esque feeling, you still have to ride the mile-long escalator to the main lobby. The entire time we\'re going up, I\'m thinking we\'re reliving Night of the Living Dead - goth, dark, creepy.\r\nHOWEVER, (and this is the reason I\'m putting them down as excellent), after a 6 hour drive with a screaming toddler, we were clearly tired and exhausted - and the front desk was well aware of our long day (I guess we looked horrid compared to all the other guests just getting the night started). They gave us a free upgrade to a corner suite, which included a nook for our son\'s play pen, sitting area with couch and coffee table, TV, king bed, separate bath and shower, entryway, and plenty of room to spare.\r\nI was a little intimidated walking into this hotel with a stroller and diaper bag, but found everyone to be very helpful and keenly aware of our situation. (Maybe it\'s because we stuck out like a sore thumb.) But great service, comfortable beds, fantastic views . . . who can complain?'
4,'Loved the hotel','We stayed there for 3 nights. Beautiful lobby and the people at the front desk were great. We paid for twin beds but got full size beds. The rooms were big enough and very clean. I enjoyed the restaurant and the bar. The location was wonderful. The only thing I had a complaint was the noise. We were on the street side and I could hear music and horns but most of the time too tried to care. I enjoyed the Gift shop, travel services and they booked your transporation to the airport. Great for the price and location is to die for. I also got to see Kevin Spacey when he was in the play just down from the hotel. He signed his autograph and got some good pictures. Will be back next year'
4,'Great location','Great place to stay as far as location goes. Speedy elevator system. Very clean room. The one negative was there was no refrigerator for leftovers or drinks. One would think there would be. The View restrurant at the top is a beautiful place for a meal or drink and not much more than any other nice place in NY.'
5,'Awesome - would definitely stay here again','We had a fantastic stay in this hotel from start to finish. We arrived earlier than the check-in time however were greeted with very friendly reception staff who checked us in without any problems. We had upgraded to a larger room with a view and boy from the 35th floor (room 3515) a view did we get. Unspoilt views of the Empire State Building and Crysler Building - totally mindblowing. The room was lovely and was cleaned well throughout our stay and the bed was very comfortable.\r\nThe transportation desk were very helpful and friendly when booking our return trip to the airport. Checkout was very efficient and the staff at the luggage store were very friendly and at $1 a bag it was very reasonable.\r\nI thought the food at the Tick Tock Diner was amazing and unlike other reviewers didn\'t find the prices bad at all. Coopers Bar is good for drinks although I wouldn\'t rush back there to eat. Staff were very friendly though.\r\nI don\'t have a bad word to say about this hotel and would recommend it to everyone and would definitely stay again. As the other reviews state yes the rooms may be a little small but the location is amazing and close to everything and in New York City how much time do you actually spend in your hotel room?!\r\nThere\'s a subway station 1 min from the hotel and this is definitely the best way to get around. One final tip - if you\'re looking for a good night out try Cafe Wha in McDougall Street - had the best night ever in this bar and the live band were amazing....\r\nAwesome place, awesome hotel :o)'
4,'Schöner Aufenthalt','Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral in der Nähe des Empire State Buildings und des Time Squares. Man kann also viele Sehenswürdigkeiten der Statdt zu Fuss erreichen.\r\nBeim Einchecken haben wir in einer langen Schlange anstehen müssen - aber vor uns ist gerade eine größere Reisegruppe engekomen. \r\nDie Zimmer sind relativ klein aber modern und ansprechend ausgestattet. Wenn man in den höhren Stockwerken untergebrachr ist, hat man eine tolle Aussicht auf die Stadt.\r\nIch würde jederzeit wieder dieses Hotel wählen.'
4,'Great Location!','Hilton New York is in the middle of everything! You\'re walking distance to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave with all the shops, theater district & Time Square!\r\nEveryone was so friendly and was able to check in early at 12noon. Our room was a bit small but I guess it\'s NYC... We had a great time exploring the wonderful city. \r\nThe only complaint I have is that the bellman recommended a very expensive steak house near the hotel called Empire. It was not what we were looking for a family with 2 toddlers. We felt out of place. We were looking for something more family friendly and casual. The steaks were very expensive & was just okay. We can get better steaks in Dallas and much cheaper too.\r\nOverall our stay was wonderful! Looking forward in staying there again!'
5,'West coast vs. East Coast','The purpose of the trip was to check out a college for my daughter. We live in california and I have never been to New York. Where to stay was a crap shoot. A co-worker of mine had stayed at the Marquis and gave it a high rating due to its location and accomodations. I was not dissapointed. While it was more than I wanted to spend, I enjoyed the experience. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I had read countless reviews on this hotel and the only minor complaint was the cost and the elevators. Maybe because I can on a Sunday and left on Wednesday but the elebators were not a problem. There was very little waiting time and because they are computerized, I made it quickly to my 43rd floor. Since it was located in Time Square, everything is centeralized....you can take a taxi, subway or walk. All the cabi\'s were polite and good drivers. Remember, this was my first trip to New York....I was pleasantly surprised.\r\nI found the hotel very clean. The bathrooms had marbel floors and the counters were a nice granite. A paper was delivers at your door each morining and their were two Starbucks in the hotel. My only complaint about this hotel would be the price but other than that....I will stay her again. If you want to contact a average guy staying at this hotel feel to contact me at cybercop4u@aol.com PS I paid extra for the view of times square and it was worth it. Alan'
3,'Decepcionado e Surpreso ao mesmo tempo','Me hospedei por 12 noites nesse hotel no final de novembro de 2012. Pelo que li aqui, fui preparado pro pior, mas chegando lá, vi que é um hotel que dá sim pra se hospedar, apesar de eu não indicar pra ninguém, nem querer voltar lá. O hotel é gigantesco, a rotatividade e o entra e sai de hóspedes são enormes, porém os elevadores (acho que 12 ao total) davam conta sem muita espera. A mobília é antiga, e a estrutura do hotel dá sinais de cansaço. O quarto single (king bed) é bem pequeno (fiquei nesse), porém vi que o quarto duplo (double king bed) é enorme. O hotel não é sujo. Todo dia havia camareira nos corredores limpando os quartos e trocando as toalhas. No meu quarto havia frigobar, tv lcd, secador de cabelos, ferro e tábua de passar, rádio-relógio, tudo funcionando e aparentemente novo. No meu andar (12) havia wi-fi grátis e rápido. No geral, o hotel precisa de uma renovação, trocar os carpetes dos quartos, reformar os banheiros, pintar as portas etc. Percebi que o hotel não permite early check-in, porém permite um late check out (solicitei sair às 13 h do hotel). Percebi que todos que chegam cedo ao hotel são orientados a guardarem as malas no guarda-volumes do hotel a um custo de US$ 4,00. Os funcionários são todos mal humorados, e o serviço é péssimo. O hotel recebe até 4 encomendas por hóspede, mas a partir de jan/13 não receberá mais. Uma encomenda minha foi extraviada no guarda-volumes. O ebay/UPS entregou a encomenda no hotel, porém os funcionários disseram que não receberam. Inclusive, tive encomendas recusadas pelo hotel. O hotel possui localização privilegiada, com metrô a poucos passos, Penn Station atravessando a rua, restaurantes/cafés/pizzas ao lado, e uma infinidade de lojas (Macys, JC Penney, Manhattan Mall, Victoria`s Secret etc.) pertinho. Pelo mesmo preço cobrado, acha-se hotel melhor na mesma região.'
4,'Great, Great, Great location!!! ... and the hotel is OK :)','Used to live in this hotel for several days in June 2009. It was my first trip to New York and all i needed was the city itself, you know: views, walks, etc. The hotel was a 100\% hit! The hotel\'s location was amazing!!! Beautiful Grand Central is adjacent to the hotel with direct corridor between them! Short walk to a very inspiring and intimate Bryant park, 10 minutes to Times Square, 4 minutes to Fifth Ave, etc. etc. etc.\r\nThe rooms were more than just OK, but i should admit - not exceptional. Small bath tube, broken plunge. Asked service to mend it, they just took it out =) But this is a trifle in comparison to a price you pay for the location.\r\nRecommend this place to tourists who can survive without Ritz-Carlton =)'
3,'Hotel Edison','Ganske udmærket hotel ca. 50 m fra Times Square. Forholdsvist billigt og fine værelser, men små toiletter..'
2,'You must be kidding','I travel a lot for business and pleasure, so I took the liberty of posting some pictures of what I describe in my write-up, please do check them out. The room was small and by small I mean there was only about 14 inches between the foot of the bed and the TV cabinet which meant you I had to walk through sideways to get across the room (picture uploaded). The bathroom was small, how small? You had to walk in, stand by the sink and then shut the door to access either the shower or the toilet, and this was a king room (picture uploaded).\r\nThere were sections in the room where the wallpaper was peeling off the wall (picture uploaded). There is NO wireless internet access in the rooms only cabled access and they want $15/day for that. If you want to use the wireless access in the lobby area you get to pay $15 more per day for that access too. I won\'t be staying here again and I certainly would NOT recommend this hotel either and I am a Hilton Honors member. NO way this should be a listed as a four star hotel. There are way too many options in Chicago to stay here.'
5,'New York at its best','We returned to the Affinia Manhattan for another 5 day stay on 14th November 2012 and were not disappointed,this must be one of the best locations in New York,next to Madison Sq. Gardens,a stone throw away from Empire State Building,Penn Station,Macys etc....\r\nFrom the well appointed rooms to the classy Niles Bar and restaurant it exudes comfort.....the staff are only too willing to assist in any way they can and make every guest feel both welcome and valued.\r\nThis was our second visit to the Affinia and it wont be the last,the only thing that was disappointing was that the time passed so quickly.I would recommend this hotel to anyone,a good standard and a pleasure to stay in....'
5,'Great location, great rooms and the BEST STAFF EVER!','I went to NYC for Easter with my mom and sister for an extended weekend getaway. It was their first time in NYC and my 5th. I wanted to make their first visit a special one and upon arrival at the Affinia Manhattan, I knew we were off to a great start.\r\nThe Affinia Manhattan is in a great location- a quick walk across the street from NY Penn Station and just a few minutes walk from Times Square. When we entered our room, we were so pleased. We were given a renovated King room with a queen sofa sleeper and in the back of the room was an office area with a desk and a mini-fridge. There was plenty of room for the three of us, having enough space to get ready in the mornings without getting too much in each other\'s way. \r\nThe bathroom was a bit small, with only a shower and no tub, but it did it\'s purpose and was fine for our needs. We did have an issue with the air conditioner not working when we first arrived, but we called guest services and they had someone up within minutes to get it fixed. We also called guest services later to request extra amenities (pillow menu/wine glasses/extra towels) and they were so quick to make it happen. Never a wait! I was definitely impressed. \r\nFrom the moment we walked into the hotel, the staff at Affinia Manhattan went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. I am especially grateful to Jenny and Lucy at the front desk. They were so helpful and I can\'t thank them enough for making our stay so special.'
1,'Not too impressed but can\'t complain too loudly','I stayed at this hotel with a group of friends. We actually stayed in one room (the 6 of us) because we were trying to save money. We got a decent price on the hotel through some connections of friends of friends but we weren\'t really impressed with the decor, amenities, and other things that were in the room. The second night was interesting since we got up early to be one of the few to get into the pool and hot tub area. The pool was suppose to be heated (it wasn\'t as heated in the morning as it should be) and we had to call a member of the staff to warm up the hot tub since it wasn\'t even luke warm. Considering a hotel of that size (over 100 rooms) only had ONE pool and ONE hot tub with a maximum of amount of people allowed in the pool and hot tub area at a time you would think they would have more than just one of each kind of amenity. Also there wasn\'t any one to enforce the rule of 8 people at a time in the hot tub. At one point there was 10-12 people in it. The staff was friendly enough but not extremely great. We had to ask for extra bedding to accomodate the people that were going to be sleeping on the floor. We thought we were going to get a room that was going to be big enough to accomodate everyone like a suite that offered a couch of some sort. But it was a standard two double sized beds. The room itself was equipped with two closets and two bathrooms which was nice to have. It would have been nice to actually have been shown the room before checking in. We waited awhile in line when checking in at 6 pm. I actually work for a hotel but not of this calibur so I can understand the reason for waiting that long. We got lost a few times but eventually found our way to the hotel and to the self parking that was cheaper than getting the valet parking. The hotel didn\'t have many resurants near them or any information on what to find around the area. But not having free internet in the room was kind of disappointing. The trip itself was fun since I was with friends but we pretty much went with the flow. Definately ask for one of the more renavated rooms if you expect a more positive stay. Over all I am honestly not impressed. The decor in the lobby should reflect something of what the rooms look like. Every hotel is judged by what the first impressions of the potential guests get when entering the lobby. The lobby was gorgeous and everyone in my group was expecting a nice spacious room that we could be comfortable in...but I guess we will have to try some other place next year.'
1,'Horrible Experience - Stay Away','You would do well to avoid this hotel at all costs. During my recent stay, the room was dirty (reaked of smoke), the windows were sealed shut, and I thought I was going to suffocate. In terms of addressing the problems , the staff were courteous, but useless. \r\nThe hotel is supposedly rated 4 stars. I would not have rated it even 2 stars. It is a aweful hotel. You can do much better than this in Manhattan.'
2,'Nice Lobby','Flashig lobby. Långsam incheckning. Varierande rum i kvalitet. Bott där flera gånger. Senast bättre rum än tidigare. Ha inte för stora förväntningar. Men det funkar.'
1,'the last place I would ever stay','Every year my job goes to the Javions Convention center for an Expo. Normally in the past weve\'e stayed at the Belvedere, due to new management we ended up at the edison. We got there on the mega bus around 11am so we figure we join our co-workers in there room until our 3pm check in. We atlease wanted to drop off our bags. The front desk gave us such a hard time we eventually had to have someone come down to take us up. Than we it came time to check in the room was not even ready at 3. They said they still had to vaccuum. I went up 15 mins after that and he hadn\' t even started. The room whole building is old and nasty and smells. The bathroom looked like something off an old horror movie. We had a suite with one small bathroom for 4 women. If the room wasn\'t stank enough the service was even worst. The rinky -dinky place stopped me to see my key card every time I went up to my room but did\'nt do it for every body I went up and came back down forgot something and he still stopped me. I felt like a second class citizen. Never in my life. Never again.'
4,'Great Property, Great Location','Ideally located in Times Square to feel the buzz yet provides, if one wants, a quiet retreat into large spacious well appointed and surprisingly quiet rooms. Efficient check-in process; fun bank of elevators and large conference/meeting rooms.\r\nInternet access is a tad pricey; restaurants are large and food quality above average, though better choices could be found within walking distance.\r\nThe USP has to be location - everything is within walking distance'
5,'The Best Affordable Hotel in Mid-town','We have stayed at the Edison many times and look forward to many return visits.\r\nThe hotel kindly emails a weather forecast prior to arrival - very welcoming.\r\nBreakfast is a must: solid, tasty food - great bagels; outstanding, quick service; have been attended by same capable servers for a number of years, which suggests reliability.\r\nEasy check-in/check-out. Our room was ready by 10:00 a.m. upon our arival!!\r\nConvenient and only a nominal fee for storing bags before or after check-in/out.\r\nWe feel secure: security does consistently check for room keys at the elevator.\r\nLocation-location-location. Great for those who attend theatre and museums.\r\nExcellent Zagat-rated restaurants nearby, even on the same block!\r\nWe highly recommend the Edison Hotel.'
4,'Great Hotel – Excellent Location & Recommended!!','Just back from 4 days in NY and stayed at the New Yorker Hotel... Great hotel with a fantastic central location, right across the road from Penn Station (madison sq gardens) and Macy’s a stone throw away. It is a mere 10 min walk to Times Square too. We had a nice small cosy room on the 26th floor and it was spotless, modern and perfect for our trip. Bed was nice and cosy so no complaints at all. As I like clean comfortable rooms, I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel. We also had a view of the Empire State Building which is nice at night. Our package, which was quite reasonable for a hotel as central as this one in NY, included continental breakfast vouchers for the Tick Tock Diner which is attached to the Hotel. Although you only get tea/coffee and a croissant/bagel or Danish with the voucher, you could have breakfast and pay for the extra items which we did each morning. Although this diner is expensive it’s handy to get your breakfast before starting your big day sightseeing or shopping and you could not ask for a better location as everything is in a short walking distance from the hotel. We watched the premiership football and dined at Tir Na Nog’s Irish Bar just up beside the hotel, same side next block up which was great, had lunch there and food was lovely. We stumbled upon a fabulous restaurant called \'Ruby Tuesdays\' just off top of Times Sq and from start to finish, the food, ambience and service was absolutly excellent ... I can not recommend enough as it was just lovely and also reasonably priced. We also took the Grey Line Bus Tour, which included a free trip on the yellow water taxi to Statue of Liberty which was absolutely brilliant... Our host Julie was great craic so would definitely recommend this tour. There is so much to see and do in NY and too much to mention here but we had a fabulous time and would definitely recommend the New Yorker Hotel. We will definitely be back no doubt and staying here again!!!'
2,'Hotel imbarazzante','Che dire... iniziamo dai lati negativi!!!! Le condizioni in cui versa questo hotel sono a dir poco imbarazzanti!!!! Camere piccole, poco curate e fatiscenti!!! Il letto non raggiungeva le 2 piazze!!!! Qualsiasi tipo di comfort a cui siete abituati è pressoché inesistente!!! I muri delle camere sono in parte scrostati!! La moquette con cui è rivestito il pavimento della camera è un vero reperto archeologico......insomma, un alloggio a dir poco spartano!!! Unica nota positiva: La posizione molto centrale che consente di raggiungere in assoluta comodità molte zone di Manhattan, (soprattutto di sera)!!! Ultima considerazione, quando si visita New York la stanza d\'albergo la si vede molto poco, quindi.... Consigliato solo a chi non vuole spendere un capitale per alloggiare nella Grande Mela!!!'
3,'Shopping trip for daughters 21st','I recently stayed in this Hotel a trip for my daughters 21st with my sister and her daughter. This hotel is location, location, location however, it is a hotel which needs some renovations. We had a couple of issues with the Hotel firstly they take €100 off your credit card even though you have paid in full??? Breakages I was told but had we of broken anything it would have been because it was about to break. Safe instructions incorrect had to get someone to help, light switch broken, cable coming out (leaving a hole in wall). We had to bring these to attention of the hotel as we didn\'t want to be charged for them. Towels/bathmaths weren\'t replaced (4 girls in a room) toiletries very scarse still using small soaps thrown out and being replaced the next day. Because of weight restrictions on planes I dont bring these type of items. Then the toilet got blocked last straw. I rang down and was told it would be a while but the Manageress Ruth was very apologetic and would have changed us had our daughters not been out at the time she also compensated us with breakfast for the rest of our stay. When I went to reception to get the vouchers the girl on reception (cann\'t remember her name) wasn\'t as nice same girl who checked us in (€100 issue).\r\nService in the restaurant was very good.\r\nBasic hotel in need of upgrading great location.'
3,'Good people, average room','Well located. Great service, but the rooms leave a lot to be desired for a Westin, specially the bathrooms.\r\nThe members lounge ours changed and it is not longer open in the evenings, which is a shame and hope management reinstates soon.\r\nAli, and the rest of the front desk staff are excellent, helpful and knowledgeable.\r\nWill return'
5,'Why would you stay anywhere else?','Location, location, location! Walking distance (and you will be walking!) to just about anywhere. Be it Times Square, 5th Avenue, Empire State Building, High Line Park, Madison Square Gardens, Greenwich Village, Soho, Broadway...you are within a walking distance. And if you want to go anywhere else, the subway (Penn Stn) is right at the corner. Free WIFI in your room, great water pressure/temperature, no noise from other rooms (and very little from the street below), air conditioning, gym, gift/convenience store, concierge (for entertainment arrangements), transportation desk(airport etc), bank machine, a 24 hr restaurant and a lounge all on site. At the edge of Chelsea and Midtown, this is perfectly located. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating, and check-in was a breeze. Yes the hotel is a bit dated and the rooms are small. But if you are in NYC to be in a hotel room, what are you doing in NYC? I wouldn\'t even think of staying anywhere else.'
4,'Nice stay','We recently spent two nights here and were happy with the accommodations. I was traveling with another family and we were all pleased with our rooms. I had a king room on the 16th floor with no view (just the inside of the bldg) but that was ok - we were only in the room to sleep. The room was a good size for NYC, the bed was comfortable, the room was clean and it was quiet. The location was awesome - just south of Central Park and just north of Times Square. Close to the metro. I would stay here again.'
4,'Affinia Manhattan','We stayed at the Affinai Manhattan in April. The staff were friendly and the hotel was smart, clean and tidy. The bell boys were very attentive and helpful. The room was clean and tidy, not huge, but big enough for a city break and a place to sleep. We took a yellow taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost $45 (each way) but was definitely the best way to get there. The location of the hotel was excellent. It\'s opposite Maddison Square Gardens, 2 minute walk to Macy\'s, 5 minute walk to Empire State Building and about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. If you want to see a show and are not fussy on what you see, use the red ticket booths at Times Square for great value last minute ticket deals - most shows had at least 50\% off. There is a Deli next to the hotel and there are several cafe, restaurants and street sellers - you will not starve in New York! We stayed on the 8th floor and whilst you could still hear the taxi horns and hustle and bustle on the streets below, we still had a good night\'s sleep - without ear plugs!'
5,'Perfect location in Chicago Loop','Great price and we actually got a room that looked like the picture! Perfect location for exploring Chicago, only a few blocks from the subway and from many attractions. Rooms ready early, adjoining as requested. Conceirge very helpful. Ate breakfast in restaurant - $20 good price for buffet. Would definately stay here again.'
4,'Good Location','Lobby was somewhat confusing, My room was on the 12th floor and there were no signs directing me where to go. \r\nOverall, comfy and clean but the elevator was quite a walk away from our room.'
3,'Well, it depends what you\'re looking for','I stayed here for three nights for business in December. I don\'t think this room had been updated since the 80\'s. Ancient wall paper, I thought the fixtures in the shower were going to fall off the wall. I had a problem with keys not working (three trips to the front desk) that no one seemed to be surprised about (half an hour wasted going back and forth getting new keys and then meeting security at my room). All that being said, the bed was comfortable and I slept well. The location can\'t be beat, it is such a great location for getting to everything in the theater district,walking distance to the Christmas tree at Rock Center. Easy access to subway. But for $500 a night, it would be nice to have a room that was up to date. It seems that some of the rooms are already updated, I would ask for that. Very friendly room service while I was working in my room.'
3,Suficiente,'El hotel en si es hermoso, un hotel antiguo, con mucha historia, uno ve en las partes comunes que fue un hotel de mucho lujo, cuando ve su historia, grandes personalidades estuvieron ahi. Tiene un starbucks en la planta baja. El cuarto, al menos el que nos toco a nosotros, es como viejo, o sea no es feo, es chiquito, muebles antiguos, algo oscura la habitacion, el baño reciclado, pero da la sensación de los hoteles de antes. la zona de dia esta cerca de todo, caminamos por todos lados, cerca del parque michigan, de las torres willis, de la Av. Michigan. Por la nochecita es algo desolada la zona, y no quisimos alejarnos del hotel. Como si fuera una zona bancaria, que de dia tiene muchisimo movimiento pero por la noche no hay nadie.- No es malo el hotel, es limpio no tiene olor a humedad, pero es basico, en cuanto a las habitaciones, el hotel en las partes comunes, es muy lindo.-'
4,Fantastic!,'Fantastic hotel, staff always happy to help and right next to Times Square with only a 10 minute walk to central park! Grey line bus tours stop really close by aswell and theres a great wee cafe right beside the hotel to get some food or drinks before exploring the city in the morning. Would definitely stay here again if going to New York!'
4,'good and bad','Firstly I would like to say the bad points.\r\nWe arrived very late after a delayed Virgin flight out of London and found ourselves placed in a room where the bathroom was in a very poor condition. The plug would not go into the bath itself and the grouting was very mouldy. The room overall seemed very tired.\r\nOn the positive side\r\nWe complained and were moved to a far better room on the 46th floor the next day. This room was excellent and more importantly the breakfast room on the 46th floor is really worth the extra money. Good breakfast and afternoon snacks and it is not over crowded, well worth the extra outlay.\r\nHotel is well located and, on the upper floors, really very quiet. We stayed with 2 small children in the same room as us and they were enthralled with the large plasma screen tv. The hotel does advertise itself as having a pool and to be fair they do have access to one on the 15th floor as part of the NY sports club. It is useless for small children however as only one lane is reserved for guests of the hotel.\r\nOverall not cheap but good location'
4,'First Timers Best Place To Go','What can one say this place is smack dab in the middle of TS...this was awesome and the staff was great...a must as it was out first time in NY and this was awesome....'
5,'Great NYC Experience','We booked our stay to celebrate our 45th anniversary. We were in town to Book of Mormon at the Eugene O\'Neil Theater. The staff could not have been more helpful, and upgraded us when learning of our anniversary. The location could not be better. The room was good size and comfortable with a view of Times Square. We decided to try the The Brassiere because of our timing and took advantage of the Pre-Theater 3 Course Special . Which we thoroughly enjoyed.'
5,'Wonderful Renovation! Fantastic Location and Great Comfort!','This hotel has the best location in the city, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Affinia Manhattan is always my first choice when returning to the city. I\'ve stayed on many occasions and the quality and service have always been superior. The newly renovated rooms have a modern, yet comfortable, decor that makes me feel at home after a day of sales calls or exploring midtown. The staff is also extremely friendly and always quick to recognize me and welcome me back. Steven (General Manager) and Andrea in Sales made a special point of making sure my stay was memorable.'
5,Terrific,'Renovated art deco hotel with great service and very convenient location. Rooms are small, it is New York after all, but clean and well maintained. The view is fantastic NY cityscape and the staff are very professional. \r\nWe had a great weekend in NY, enjoyed a show at MSG across the street, walked everywhere from this central location. \r\nFor the very picky, it could always be less expensive, rooms could be larger, and the external sounds of the city could always be quieter. Didn\'t detract at all from our stay. \r\nLoved it and will return.'
4,'Smart & perfectly situated','Husband & I have just returned from a 3 night stay in New York and he chose The Westin as our hotel.\r\nWe arrived on Tuesday 22nd Feb around 2.30, having got the express bus from Newark - would recommend in you\'re on a budget at $25 dollars for a return trip, takes half an hour so probably quicker than a cab and certainly a lot cheaper.\r\nThe receptionist wasn\'t the most welcoming I\'ve ever met, she wasn\'t rude but she didn\'t really exude much warmth.\r\nOur room was on the 17th floor, views of the Hudson to our left and of course, other buildings. Bed is huge and very, very comfortable. Loved the shower with its double head, towels nice size - their web site says traditional rooms have bathrobes, which we didn\'t have but not a big deal so we didn\'t call reception to get them.\r\nThere was a coffee maker provided but it was unclear if there was a cost for it. We don\'t drink coffee in the morning so again, didn\'t mention anything at reception.\r\nWe ate breakfast out each morning, eggs, sausage, tea & juice. We didn\'t eat at the hotel either, but would highly recommend The Bangkok House at W46th Street, between 8th & 9th Avenue, great food, very welcoming staff and very reasonably priced.\r\nWe also frequented Smiths Bar, which is just across the street from The Westin - again, friendly staff, particularly Peter who grew up about 15 miles from where we live!\r\nWe also loved the pizza at Bella Vita, just around the corner towards Times Square.\r\nWe went to see Memphis, enjoyed that too and ate at The Oyster Bar at Grand Central.\r\nOn departure, we left our bags with the hotel, talk to the security guy as you enter the hotel, you leave them with him. They also had umbrellas that guests could borrow and we did so as it rained on our last morning. \r\nThe Westin is a very nich hotel, great beds - described on their website as \'heavenly\' and they are, ditto the shower. We thought the location was really great - a little noisy but that\'s to be expected somewhere like NY. The subway is across the street, bars, restaurants, theatres and Times Square are all within easy walking distance - if you dont\' mind walking. \r\nI would stay again and would recommend to others.'
5,'what a nice surprise','The hotel penn was clean comfortable and was not what we expected for a 2 star,\r\nwill stay again next year definately\r\nlovely.x'
4,'Quirky, Stylish and Petit!','I can understand why some people don\'t like this hotel. If you book a standard room you will end up with a very small room. For my wife and I (early thirties) this was fine and actually quite cosy but I could understand you need to be of a certain mindset to enjoy this room and hotel.\r\nTo start with the hotel is perfectly located, only a 15 minute walk from Times Square, a couple of minutes from a supermarket and subway station (St Christopher\'s) and a fixed $45 ride from JFK (about an hour journey).\r\nIf you are travelling from Newark Airport - we took the train from the Airport to Penn (30 minutes) and then a cab from there ($10).\r\nThe room is of decent quality, just everything in the standard room is a little tight. To be honest if you were of the larger build you would struggle to sit on the toilet or stretch in the shower!\r\nWe quite liked the room and the atmosphere of the hotel and would return if we were in New York. Beware it can get noisy at times with the noise of the streets and the club - this is New York though! Staff are great. \r\nIf you want a bigger room, then stop complaining and pay for a bigger room! We ate breakfast in the hotel once and although it was good it was overpriced and better is available locally.\r\nHotel is cool and think appeals to the younger & trendier tourists (not that I am either!)'
2,'Overpriced and shabby','Overpriced with price changes daily! I rebooked my room online 3 times at better prices each time. The agent I contacted by phone couldn\'t help me with changing the reservation, said to just cancel and rebook. The room was shabby, stained wall paper, mold in the shower. Pipes banging 24 hours a day, a given for an old building but still frustrating. No controls on the air conditioner which was out of service one entire day during our stay. No cell phone reception in the room either due to the configuration of the hotel, not their fault, but frustrating to say the least. This was our third stay, and last, at this hotel. It has gone down in quality over the past two years considerably. \r\nRight before our trip I saw lots of comments specifically thanking certain people, that was a giveaway that someone was paid to place those comments. There was no one at the hotel who offered us a hello, even the doorman couldn\'t be bothered to assist when we arrived in a taxi in the rain.'
3,'Great location, basic rooms','This hotel has a perfect location, in downtown Manhattan. \r\nThe rooms were clean and pretty quiet. \r\nIt\'s a very big hotel, so you might have to wait a while when checking in.\r\nI bought a NYY-cap and this brand new cap got stolen from our room, probably by one of the maids. We didn\'t report this, since it would probably be useless and take a lot of time. So watch out with valuables in your room.'
4,'Bem localizado e Preço justo','Este hotel fica ao lado do Central Park, 10 minutos andando, e próximo ao Sul de Manhattan, praticamente e só descer a 57th avenue.\r\nHotel bem conservado, limpo e amplo, sem dificuldades de locomocao ou poucos elevadores. Só faltava uma maior variedade no café da manhã, mas nada que fosse decepcionante. Outro ponto negativo é de que não tem estacionamento próprio o que encarece o seu custo.'
2,'Fine for what we needed but it isn\'t somewhere I would recommend to friends and family.','We went to New York for our honeymoon and were VERY excited about our trip. On arrival at the hotel, we were amazed by the location and how perfect it was - The Empire State was just a few blocks away, Times Square was a litte further along. Maddison Square Gardens was across the road. Great access to the subway providing access to the whole city. \r\nWe went to check in were impressed by the reception area; grand and elegant. We asked about an upgrade and were given a King size bed rather than a double. That was about the only good thing about the room!\r\nWe were staying on the 10th floor - one window overlooked a block of offices, the other I don\'t know as we kept the curtains shut! The carpet was thin and looked dirty. The bathroom had missing tiles and holes in both the sink and bath. The plugs were loose and only one of the four worked. The television remote was missing. The bed however was incredible and despite the constant noise from the city below, we slept like babies every evening. My husband said they\'re in the process of renevating the hotel - they must be staying in the Pent House suites! \r\nTo be fair, you don\'t go to New York to stay in the hotel, so we only really needed a room in order to sleep and freshen up from the day to evening, therefore, we weren\'t really in the room long enough from one day to the next. Ultimately, you\'re paying for the loaction. Having said all that, I still expected a little more from the room itself.\r\nThe staff were mixed... there was a lovely lady on the information desk who was more than happy to assist us in finding our way from A to B. The other staff were not as helpful.\r\nThe little cafe attached to the hotel was very expensive!! Our first morning we went for breakfast and didn\'t go again. The staff however were lovely and very friendly.\r\nAll in all, it was fine for what we wanted and needed but it isn\'t somewhere I would recommend to friends and family.'
5,'Excellent Westin','Booked a 4 night stay with Expedia at the Westin Hotel and what a brilliant time we had. \r\nStayed in the Excecutive Club, which gave us complimentary breakfast\'s each day, and this was surprisingly good, with a fine selection of food and drink, in you own Executive Lounge. The rooms themselves were excellent with Heavenly beds, plasma tv\'s, Bose radios and PC\'s, the showers were really very good with twin heads and extremely powerful.\r\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, and I had no problems in getting tickets for events or some extra equipment for the room, requested a fridge and it arrived within minutes.\r\nThen there is the location in Times Square, simply stunning, walking distance from most of the major attractions, and with subway and bus connections just around the corner if required.\r\nNot my first visit to New York, but for first time visitors its hard to top Times Square as a location, there\'s a real buzz to the place and a great atmosphere, with plenty of places to eat at reasonable prices, and despite the big crowds as we arrived at Memorial Weekend, getting seated was no problem.\r\nGreat hotel in a great location, thoroughly recommend the Westin and looking to come back to New York as soon as possible.'
5,'Fabulous hotel and staff!!','We stayed at the Westin NY in Times Square at the end of January and had a great time. It\'s an excellent location if you want to be in Times Square. We had upgraded our room to the Club Floor, so the room was a nice size, and included continental breakfast. We had a decent sized bath with slate floors. We were on the 16th floor and could barely hear any street noise. The Heavenly Beds are truly heavenly but the dual showerhead in the bath seemed unnecessary. We did have a slow draining tub drain - but it was fixed immediately when we called to report it. The hotel staff was excellent - and they accommodated our early check-in (6:45 am). Yes, the hotel can be a pricey, but for NY, it is worth every penny.'
4,'Hotel gigante','Hola estuve alojado en para noviembre justo para el dia de accion de gracias y la verdad que el hotel desbordaba de gente y aun asi tubo buen servicio tanto en la limpieza como en la atencion del personal y la ubicacion esta buena porq esta cerca del central park y esto habilita una caminata matutina y despues estas a 2 minutos para ducharte y seguir con el paseo'
5,'so brillant','im just after returning from the big apple and we stayed in new york\'s hotel pennsylvania, we went for 5 days and it was the best 5 days we had,\r\nthe hotel is lovely, the staff are helpful & friendly, our hotel room was huge there was 2 double beds in it plenty of space for all the shopping, it is a bit old fashioned but it didnt bother us its what you make of it yourself for all the time you\'d spend in the hotel room anyway.\r\nii is so central to everything it\' s across the road from madison sq gardens 10 mins from empire state building, the mahattan mall is only around the corner from the pennsylvania hotel, times square is just down the road rockefeller centre is only about 15 mins away all worth goin to, its brillant, i would definitely go back in the morning without a doubt i just fell in love wit the city'
5,Class,'C\'est un magnifique hôtel . Nous avons été bien acceuilis et bien servi à l réception par Elisabeth qui est très gentille et très serviable .Pour moi c\'est la plus gentille réceptionniste que j\'ai jamais connu'
5,'FABULOUS NYC HOTEL','I have stayed in this hotel numerous times in the past few years. When I come into the city this is where I always stay and I\'m never disappointed. It\'s beautiful and such a pleasure to stay here. Some people complain about the elevators, but I never have a problem. The rooms are lovely and spotless and the location is perfect if you are seeing a show.'
4,'Great hotel, great location.','My family (two parents, two elementary-aged kids) stayed at the New Yorker for four nights in late June 2011. It was a pretty good stay. Here are the cons and pros:\r\nCons\r\n1) I was excited when we were told we were getting a free upgrade to a slightly larger corner room, and when we arrived in the room I was quite happy with the room, and (more importantly) my wife liked it. We had just finished a 24 hour trip from the other side of the globe and were somewhat jetlagged, so we went out for a stroll after 10 PM. When I was a kid, you would never have taken a stroll in Manhattan at that time, but now it\'s perfectly safe. So we walked up and had our first view of Times Square. The hotel is very close to Times Square, but that\'s a pro, so I\'ll come back to it. We arrived back in our room and dropped into bed, only to be quickly roused by what sounded like someone pounding on the door. We quickly realized that it was the sound of the elevator. I went through the labyrinth hallways and realized that our nice corner room was right beside the room that houses the big machines that run the elevators. So, all night we heard thunking and pounding whenever anyone used the elevator (in the city that doesn\'t sleep). \r\n2) It\'s expensive, but it\'s Manhattan, so everything\'s expensive.\r\nOkay, those are all the cons. Now to the pros:\r\n1) The moment I went to the front desk to complain about the room, they were happy to change our room, so we went from the 23rd floor to a far superior room on the 33rd. The view was better, the room was arranged in a more pleasing way, and best of all - no elevator sounds. Lesson for you, dear reader? Make sure to ask for a room that is not near the elevator machine rooms. But, they were great about changing our room.\r\n2) Did I mention it was close to Times Square? We walked back and forth several times and always felt perfectly safe. It\'s also close to the Penn Station subway (more on that later), and close to all kinds of food and shopping. \r\n3) The little cafe below (Tick Tock Cafe) was nice. Expensive, but nice. But hey, it\'s Manhattan.\r\n4) We rode the subway in from JFK (jetlagged with kids) and it was only a bit confusing for us out-of-towners. We had virtually no problems coming or going, it was cheap, and easy. Save the money for your Tick Tock Cafe breakfast and take the subway! \r\n5) They had a nice little workout room downstairs that we used a couple of times. It was nice. Also a convenient little business center.\r\n6) We had some friends come up from New Jersey one afternoon, and while in our room, one of their kids got a bit out of control and accidentally knocked over a lamp. We alerted the hotel and were prepared to pay for it, but it was never mentioned to us. We thought this was nice.\r\n7) There is usually a hotel employee standing near the elevators checking that people have keys and are truly guests of the hotel. This made us feel even safer.\r\nSo, overall, we would say it\'s a great place to stay if you are wanting to pay Manhattan prices. Again, just make sure to ask for a room not near the elevator machine rooms and you should love it as well!'
5,'We were impressed with this hotel -clean...','We were impressed with this hotel -clean, spacious, helpful staff and in a fantastic location (just a few minutes walk to Times Sq, Fifth Avenue and Central Park.\r\nWe were stuck in New York for a few extra days because of the volcano and the hotel helped us out by allowing us to keep our room at the cheaper rate (thus saving us $130 a night).\r\nThe only bad thing about the hotel is the Business Centre, which charges an extortionate $1 a minute for the Internet - avoid!'
5,'Excellent location and elegant hotel','I enjoyed my stay at the Palmer House and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It\'s a beautiful historic building with a style and attention to detail that recalls the elegance of the 1920\'s-- check online for pictures of the grand lobby or peacock doors to get a sense of the ambiance. At the same time the hotel offers the modern conveniences we\'ve come to expect-- like updated room decor, comfortable king size beds, and a high standard of customer service. The location of the hotel simply cant be beat. It\'s on the El line (which you can take right from the airport), close to restaurants and cafes, and easy walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Art Institute, Millennium Park and other major downtown attractions. The staff is also friendly and helpful and genuinely wants to ensure that your visit is enjoyable. Everyone from the concierge to the bar staff was extremely helpful and offered us information, directions and personalized recommendations for the things we were interested in. Although some people will always find things to complain about (the size of the bathroom-- please!) I can\'t speak highly enough about the Palmer House and my experience here.'
2,'NICE HOTEL','We stayed on a room only basis for five nights at the beginning of the month. The room was clean and spacious and inoffencively furnished. The bed was very comfortable and noiseless (we were on the 12th floor). The only service I used was the concierge in reception and I spoke to William who was very obliging, helpful and polite. The other concierges I spoke to were OK but William was excellent. The hotels location is excellent.'
4,'Bijoux room','I was highly curious about this hotel as all the magazines raved about it and I wasn\'t disappointed. If you get pass the fact that it is the tiniest room that I stayed in NY, it is charming. I found the staff friendly, especially the guys on door duty outside the hotel. Certaintly not stuck up like some places.\r\nReception could have done with more people to cover the volume and set up a queue as quite a few people jumped ahead of the line, which makes you angry as their arrogance.\r\nI dined in the restaurant, sitting on the side table opposite the kitchen, watching the chefs cook. The waiters were very attendive and helped me with choosing my meal. \r\nWhat I didn\'t like were the cleaning staff knocking on my door at 8am, they kept asking me what time I was leaving the room and I would like a lie-in during my holiday but I felt like I should hurry up and get out so that they could do their job.\r\nIn the evenings, the queues for the lifts were huge, they should set aside lifts that are specifically for guests and not for the bars in the hotel. Also they could have better lighting in that section of the hotel as it\'s extremely dark!\r\nOtherwise I enjoyed my stay, its close to the subway, central park, the mall and if the price was right, I would definitely stay again.'
4,'rip off','I went to the Hilton, Avenue of Americas, for a conference and stayed a few days more. The conference paper had info about the Executive Level for $50 more a day. They said it would be an upgraded room (not) and complimentary breakfast and hors d\'oeuvres. The exexcutive level is on the highest level of the hotel so it takes forever for the elevator. There are so many people for the breakfast and afternoon snacks, you stand in line. There is a cash bar. The wirele3ss is free, but it costs about $10 a day to purchase. I have stayed at this hotel before, not on the executive level. I think this is a rip off, unless you are using the free food for your main meals. When I come to NYC, I go to nice restaurants. So it really is not necessary to upgrade to the executive level even if you have to pay for breakfast, wireless and snacks. There is a nice grocery store that sells wine very close to the hotel'

1,'Like staying at a Morgue','This hotel was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review warning all of you who are considering it. The hallways leading to the room were dark and dingy and I felt like we were in a Morgue. The room and hallways are extremely musty, and the stench in the air was almost intolerable. I would bet that the rooms have not been updated since the 1950\'s which wouldn\'t matter much to me, although the curtains, carpet, and bedding all appeared to be 20+ years old. The paint on the walls was coming off, and the air conditioner barely worked. The blanket on the bed actually had holes in it, and the bedspread was soiled. I was actually concerned when I went to plug my cell phone into the outlet, as they looked so old that the though of electrocution came into my mind. My kids were walking around in the room in their bare feet, and after about an hour their feet were black. We had friends staying here as well, so we visited their room and it was basically the same setup and highly disappointing experience.\r\nIf you are a college student or a young traveler, these things may not bother you, but if you have children or are a couple please take my advice and look elsewhere. Even if you get a great deal it is not worth it. I normally do not care too much about hotel rooms as I don\'t spend much time in them other than sleeping, but I can honestly say that I was counting the hours until I could get up and leave this place.'
1,'Worst Hotel I\'ve ever seen','This hotel was horrible. The lobby was musty with old stained furniture. Then there was the room. It was as big as a cracker box. The carpet was filthy and pulled back from the walls. The wall paper was stained and peeling from the walls. The bed was like an old cardboard box. The sheets were so thin you could see through them, which was not a pretty picture. I literally cried because we were forced to stay the one night. My husband and I slept in our clothes, what little sleep we got. It was the most horrific experience of my life. It was not worth one star and it did not look like any of the pictures I had seen nor did the desciptions fit it. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Not even Satan.'
2,'Worker stole my cell phone! Management didnt even reply to my inquires','We went for a four day , three night stay at the Crowne Plaza in New York. upon arrival we were greeted at the front desk and told computors were down and we could not get a room. We had to wait an hour before checking in. Room was spacious no complaints. The morning we left I left my cell phone in my room ( there is no debate on this, I left it there, I was charging it) When I got to the airport in Montreal Canada I realized my phone was left in the room.(approx 3.5 hrs later) I called the hotel and eventually was turned over to security. They went to the room and said there was no phone there. So it is obvious that it was stolen by a staff member. ( i would suggest the maid service) After hearing this I sent four emails to Crowne plaza, (main office and the actual hotel. ) The main corporation office replied telling me they would send it on to the actual hotel in New York. The hotel in New York DID NOT even have the decency to contact me , let alone help solve the problem. I sent several emails to them with no reply. Very disappointed on how this was handled and how I was treated. We wil NEVER stay in a Crowne Plaza Hotel ever again. It is a shame that staff can not be trusted.'
4,'Their only downfall is the price of all the extras!','It was lovely as long as you know what you’re in for. The front desk was kind, and\r\napologetic about the outrageous fees the hotel charges for parking, access to the\r\ngym & internet. I couldn’t get free wireless in the hotel’s Starbucks, but there is a\r\ncafé next door where you can. And yes it\'s true - valet parking is $61 a day, regular parking is $38.\r\nThe location is great, the atmosphere can’t be beat, and I loved the gathering space\r\nin the lobby - the view of the lobby makes up for the lack of view from the room. \r\nOur room was sizable and had a walk in closet, but our traveling\r\npartner\'s room was somewhat cramped. The design of the hotel is interesting, and it was\r\nquite a trek from our room to the elevator/ice. The pool & hot tub were tiny, and\r\ndidn’t really lend itself to being a lounging area.'
1,ASQUEROSO,'Vaya asco de hotel, la habitación no tenia nombre...Sucia, las almohadas olian a cuero cabelludo, las colchas a tabaco, la moqueta llena de bichos, los muebles con dos dedos de polvo, los enchufes descolgados de la pared. El detector de humo tapado con bolas de papel higienico. El baño viejo, oxidado y no muy aseado. El aire acondicionado hacia el mismo ruido que el motor de un trailer y lanzaba kilos de polvo y ácaros cada vez que lo ponias en marcha.\r\nAsi que ni ubicación ni leches, no le aconsejo a nadie que se hospede allí, y menos si se acaba uno de casar, porque te dan una habitación como la que nos dieron a nosotras en tu luna de miel, y se convierte en tu luna de horror.'
2,'Doesn\'t meet its own high opinion of itself','This hotel is trying desperaely to be cutting edge. hence the dark corridors and rooms. Advice: bring a flashlight so you can see the contents of your suitcase.\r\nWhen I arrived it was chaos outside and I had to drag my own cases into the lobby (on a bitter cold evening after a 12 hour flight - no I wasn\'t happy). When I left the next afternoon I had to hail my own cab outside and drag my bags out again as it was chaos once again.\r\nCheck in was efficient but perfunctory. When I eventually found my room down endless litter-strewn dark hallways I found it was occupied. Back to the front desk where they gave me another room, supposdely an upgrade which I think meant on a higher floor, not a larger room. Street noise was loud. Room tiny. \r\nThis hotel needs to focus on guest service rather than decor and trying to be hip. I got a good rate and would be much more unhappy if I\'d paid the regular rate. Don\'t think I\'d stay here again unless it was a great deal.'
3,'Rooms need some updating...','The hotel is relatively nice. There is plenty to do with bars and restaurants right on the property. And, if you like being in the heart of New York City, then you\'ll love the location. The rooms, however, are pretty dated, and almost a little sketchy hotel-like. \r\nAlso, as a Platinum Elite member, they were not very pleasant at check-in.'
1,'The WORST Hotel in NYC!!!!!','You have to read this before you go! I stayed at this hotel in April 2004. I checked in at about 10PM. After having to stand in a queue for about 1 hour with all my suitcases and really tired, i finally got my key chucked at me, by a girl that did not even care who I was. I went up to my room, walking down the corridors, I got this really bad feeling the room was going to be bad, because the corridors look like something out of a Horror movie. I got into my room. Shock Horror, the bed had dirty sheets, someones blood on it. I did not open the closet or drawres for the week I was there, because they where AWEFULL. I lived out of my suitcase. I was worried of even having a shower there, it was filthy. My TV set was just standing there on a wooden apple box, and to top it off, my room overlooked another roof on the next building, and every morning there where people walking on that roof, and they would look into my room, as there where no curtains. This hotel should be either knocked down, or shut down and renovated. I still can\'t believe I chose this hotel. It\'s the first time I chose a hotel because it was cheap, and whitout looking in the books, and I have stayed in NYC often, I should have gone to my known hotels. If you are going to stay here, get a REFUND, and get another hotel....If not for yourself, this WILL ruin your time in NYC!!!'
5,'Hilton Rocks','I attended a convention and stayed 4 nights here. Definitely ask for a room with 2 beds even if you\'re travelling alone, because the room was huge, and preferrably one with the 2 baths. I was charged the same rate as a fellow traveller who had a cramped one-bed room. The staff is excellent and knowledgeable. I could not exit my room without being hello-ed by the cleaning staff even. \r\nGood food is on every corner. There is a little mom/pop diner on the same block, check it out for cheap, good breakfast. Room was spotless all week and concierge desk very responsive. No view but I didn\'t spend much daylight hours in my room anyway, so no big deal. Bellhops fast and gracious. All furnishings and appointments luxurious and newer. \r\nI would HIGHLY reccommend this place.'
3,'all in all, I\'d stay there again...','My wife and I spent 7 days in that hotel to celebrate 8 years of marriage. Although the hotel was built in the 20\'s, when you get inside it doesn\'t look so old fashion. As a matter of fact it\'s got a beautiful lobby, well decorated. The elevators are big and fast. You don’t have to wait long for them, and once you get it, in a few seconds you are in you floor. The room we stayed is really small, but cozy. The location is great, near the Metro and bus stations. Most members of the staff are helpful, but some not that much. All in all, I would stay again in the New Yorker Hotel.'
5,'Great location, very helpful attentive staff','My wife and I stayed here for a week, from 9th March to 16th March. This was our first visit to NYC, we had researched this hotel through Tripadvisor and from speaking with our friends. The hotel seems to be a popularly choice and it\'s understandable why. Firstly it\'s in a prime location and was central for us to all the places we wanted to see and go to. We arrived by subway, which is less than 100m from the hotel. \r\nI had booked this trip as part of my wife\'s birthday present and to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The best price was actually direct with the hotel, however given the economic climate I used a local travel agent.....another story!\r\nOn arrival we where allocated a basic room on the 32nd floor. The room was practical and clean, but small. Although we expected this as we were led to believe all hotel rooms in NYC are of similar size. \r\nA few days later we returned from a day of shopping to be upgraded to a suite on the 38th floor!\r\nThis room was spectacular, it had its own balcony! I have read reviews about its only a room, you won\'t be I. The room much but my advice would be if you can get a suite!\r\nOther points about the hotel.\r\nHotel staff were friendly, helpful and attentive.\r\nThe attached dinner Tick Tock and bar/restaurant offer good meals and service. \r\nRooms clean and practical, although no safes in either room we stayed.\r\nOther reviews complained about time spent waiting on lifts, we had no problems. \r\nYou can arrange a yellow cab taxi from the airport to the hotel, we didnt but priced it with staff who estimated it to be around $60, inclusive of tips and tolls. \r\nWould i recommend this hotel.....yes most definately!!!!!'
5,'Great location','Great location for this hotel, although it isn\'t stricly ON Times Square, the main entrance being just around the corner.\r\nWithin walking distance of many of the main tourist spots and the bus stops.\r\nSpotlessly clean, comfortable beds, great views. Staff were VERY helpful and responded to all requests within minutes.\r\nCouldn\'t say the same for one particular waiter in Bar10 who was EXTREMELY rude to us due to a misunderstanding with our tip - my tip to him is to learn some manners and be more tolerant of tired travellers!'
4,'Gran hotel, magnifica ubicacion','Es la segunda ocacion que nos alojamos en el New Yorker, su ubicacion es magnifica en la puerta tienes la famosa Penn station, que te conecta a todo NY, del JFK llegas directo por el subway, esta a 2 cuadras de Macys y caminado llegas rapido al Distrito de teatros (8cuadras), 5a Ave a 3 cuadras, si deseas regresar en taxi del central park, columbus o la 5a Ave no te costara mas de 10 Dlls. Muy buena seguridad, sus habitaciones son pequeñas pero comodas, el servico es bueno, su cafe aceptable para 1 o 2 desayunos, el restaurant bar bueno para un martini. Si entras a su liga de tweeter o face puedes obtener un buen descuento.'
4,'Great location, but...','...there is a construction site next door and work is being done on the facade of the building. Noise started around 7 in the morning. I\'d been upgraded to a suite and the rooms were attractive, spacious and very clean. Instead of asking for a room change, I asked for a fan, and that provided enough white noise to mask most of the construction. A pillow menu is offered and housekeeping was very good about honoring my requests, always with a smile. The bed is comfortable. I\'m an insomniac, but once I had the fan, I slept quite well. Bathrooms are small, but not difficult to move around in for an average sized person. I\'d stay here again, but would ask to be located away from the construction, which looks like it will be going on for a while.'
4,'high standard','Last March I\'ve been staying at Edison Hotel. I booked a single room through the last minute travel web site and I must say it was quick and easy, not expensive and safe. Although I travel a lot, It was the first time I booked a room through the net and true I felt a bit insecure about it, but my fears were all gone once I arrived at the hotel. Though it is rated as a 3 stars hotel as far as I concern it is a 4 stars hotel. The business services and facilities were excellent and the location was too good to be true. I highly recommend it!'
4,'Good position, friendly staff, great location and views!','The hotel is in a good position. Before we left I read a review which said to email consierge and ask for one of the higher rooms and this was definatly a good move. Our bedroom looked out straight onto the Empire State with the Chrysler Building and Times Square on the left. \r\nThe hotel room was a fair size, if you used the wardrobe and draws there was plenty of room for two people. The rooms were very clean and tidy. The only downfall was the bathroom which has not been modernised as the rooms have however the shower was always hot and fairly powerful so no real complaints! We used the consierge once and although we waited over half an hour they were very helpful.\r\nThe position of the hotel sells itself, ten mins walk to times square and a subway round the corner. I dont think you could beat this hotel on value for money however I would also recommend looking at the Grand Hyatt Hotel aswell.'
2,'Location great, but that\'s just about all! Not a 4* hotel, greatly dissappointed.','We stayed here for 8 nights for our 1st year wedding anniversary from the 1-9 Sept. Chose hotel based on trip advisor reviews & previous excellent stay in Westin Cape Town. \r\nThe hotel is situated perfectly in times square, most places within walking distance. Overall the hotel itself does not qualify to be a 4*, maybe a 3*, let me elaborate;\r\nLOCATION: GREAT, situated right in times square, but reconsider if you prefer a more peaceful area as times square is loud, noisy and crowded. \r\nLOBBY & RECEPTION: AVERAGE, this area not exclusive to people staying in the hotel, other people using hotel for meetings/conferences etc, thus areas get crowded. \r\nROOMS: TERRIBLE, small (excuse is this is NY), fortunately after complaining we were moved from a premium deluxe to a corner room which was a little better. Only one sink bowl in the bathroom, finishes very outdated, shower inside bath tub. Basic bathroom amenities such as shower gel, shower cap, toothpaste & toothbrush holders are not placed in the bathroom. You have to request them every morning. Initial room had no clock radio as advertised on website. Some lights were not working. Room cleanliness questionable. The good views at night were dampened by the room itself. \r\nSTAFF: POOR, if it wasnt for a lady called Sara I would have rated this as terrible. She made our day, she was friendly when we checked in, informative & sent champagne on the day of our \r\nanniversary. Otherwise service was pathetic, took more than an hour for someone to bring a shower cap & gel, on the day we left we showered & checked out still waiting for these. Daily complimentary water was never brought to our room, we had to request it twice until we gave up. Concierge was never helpful, seemed as if you were bothering them, scanty with info, if you are lucky they slap you with 1 or 2 brochures and don\'t explain anything even if you tell them it\'s your 1st time in NY. The night prior to check out I requested a pro forma invoice. When I informed reception that the rates they billed are incorrect, the gentleman at reception felt offended, even after I showed him an email reservation confirmation which he was not interested in initially. When I insisted he took the email went to his manager. Took about 30min to resolve a simple issue. I was also upset with the fact that the same gentleman was just overly friendly to another lady who was checking in at the same time whilst I was checking the invoice. Maybe because she was a platinum SPG member.\r\nWIFI: AVERAGE, slowest wifi we experienced in all the hotels we stayed in whilst in the US. What good is wifi if immediately you step out of your room whilst still in lift signal is so weak, cannot work at all at the reception and lobby. \r\nIn conclusion, our stay in this hotel was terrible. We stayed in Sofitel hotels in DC & LA during the same trip, these were excellent 4* hotels. \r\nRegards,'
4,'Good Location for sightseeing','We used this hotel this past summer for our annual visit to NYC and found it to be very convenient to all of the theatres (we even walked from here to Lincoln Center). If you come into the city by bus this is the most convenient location to stay since it is virtually across the street from the transit authority--making it easy to travel anywhere in the city.The rooms were small as you would expect in NYC but appeared to be quite clean and quiet. The lobby is small but functional. Overall based on price and location--would return again in future visits to NYC.'
5,'Excellent location and comfortable','This is our second time staying in this hotel. The location simply cannot be beat. It is near everything. You can walk to the theaters, Rockefeller Center, 5th avenue shopping, etc or you can take a short cab ride if you don\'t like to walk or the weather is bad. We stayed in a king room with a full bathtub and it was very comfortable. Bed could be a little softer but all in all is was very nice. Staff was prompt and excellent. I have no complaints about this hotel and will stay here again. One suggestion, if you want pizza, do not order it from room service. It is not traditional New York Pizza, wasn\'t very good and charged $36 for a very small pizza. Walk out the front door and go any direction for a slice instead.'
5,'Great Stay','This hotel was in a great locationl. It is right across the street from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. It is 1 block from a MTA subway station. The hotel is 3 blocks from Macy\'s and one Ave. from the Empire State Building. The rooms were very clean. They include a small kitchen. My husband said that the pillows were the most comfortable pillows that he has ever slept on. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We were delayed 7 hours arriving in New York and missed one night at the hotel. They did not charge us for the night that we missed because of our train delay. I highly recommend staying at Affinia Manhattan.'
4,'Tout simplement parfait','Nous venons de passer mon ami et moi une semaine à New York à l\'hotel Marriot.\r\nIl est idéalement situé au coeur de Times Square et proche du métro. J\'avais pris une chambre avec vue sur Times Square justement, et c\'était vraiment époustouflant!\r\nAccueil sympa et avenant, propre, beaucoup d\'ascenseur dispo dons jamais bcp d\'attente! Nous étions au 42 ème étage ! Je déconseille par contre le bar à sushi de l\'hotel :trop chèr pour la quantité servi ! par contre à faire : le Sapporo resto japonais qui sert des noodle dans une ambiance hyper nippone!'
2,'Great location, but poor service with noisy rooms','Agree with another review.. the looby looks nice but it stops there. We checked into our room and then started hearing a cranking noise every couple minutes.. which turned out to be the service elevator. Called the reception to get another room and Vanessa said there was nothing she could do, that for the rate I had paid, all the rooms were like this. However, for $80 I could get a better one. Hello? Does one have to pay more to be able to fall asleep at a hotel? After a few more senteces it was clear that this person had no sense of customer service and there was nothing she was willing to do. The rooms need some TLC and this hotel, although has a great location is not worth the money.'
1,'A great disappointment','The hotel boasted refurbished rooms. We booked one and compalined about the state of the room when we checked in. The replacement room was little better. \r\nSo called refurbishment did not include modernisation. Dated fittings were replaced with equaly dated designs. The room was in need of decoration, the furniture tatty there was little clothes hanging space and the steel door entry to the room made one feel you were entering a coffin.\r\nOn the plus side it was 10-15 minutes walk from Times Square.\r\nOverall, poor value for money.'
2,'Poor End To A Great Honeymoon!!!','When we walked into the Hotel I was surprised I really liked it till I got to the reception desk, We checked in as usual and was asked to give my card for insidental\'s so as I have with all the other Hotels that we have stayed in while on our Honeymoon I gave my card only to be told that it has been refused so when I asked why (The car hire was on the card anyway) I was told that $250 will be taken then given back when we checked out this has never happened before in any hotel that I have been to in the USA nor New York, I paided in full for the room before I went and was told that I had to pay the $250 this is not printed anywhere to state this, good job I had the cash!!! But could of done with it as this was the last few dats in US and where short as it was having spent nearly 3wks there. \r\nThen they said that they would upgrade us due to our honeymoon we had a room on the 28th floor with a city veiw!!!!!! Wot city veiw, wonder wot room we did have first off, when we got into room VERY small but this was ok how much time do you spend in your room anyway, bathroom could do with updating, when we went to bed tho o god it was noisey you could hear next door the walls are very thin you could hear over the hall the door\'s are very thin and the pipes made noise\'s all night. I had a fab time on my honeymoon having been to 3 other hotel\'s in California but this hotel let me down badly. I work in the travel industry and will not be recommending it to my customers the only good thing about it was the bed!!!! All I can say is that I have stayed in many a hotel in New York and have never been asked to pay or have any money taken off my card for incidentals it is normally as a percaution then when you do come to check out that is when it is paid either from the card details that they hold or something else ie: cash/other card.'
2,'In vita mia ho visto di meglio','Il 1° Maggio io e mio marito siamo partiti esaltatissimi per la nostra luna di miele.\r\nCi eravamo preventivamente informati su questo albergo consigliatoci dall\'agenzia e ci sembrava carino.\r\nArriviamo per fare il check-in e prima sorpresa chiedono il pagamento per il deposito bagagli...pace...mancava mezz\'ora all\'ora prestabilita per la consegna della camera e abbiamo aspettato.\r\nLa camera era piccola (nel senso che in due con le valigie aperte non ti giravi più), rumorosa (purtroppo era sulla strada e non c\'è stato verso di farsela cambiare) e non particolarmente pulita con un bagno vecchiotto e sporco.\r\nIl personale non è mai stato particolarmente gentile, anzi erano pure un po\' cafoni.\r\nL\'unica cosa che lo salva è la posizione, ma alla fine nella stessa zona ci sono alberghi ovunque e più o meno su quelle cifre.\r\nNYC è splendida e alla fine lì ci dovevamo solo dormire...ma diciamo che non lo consiglio caldamente a meno che non si abbiano troppe pretese.\r\nPerò in Jamaica ci siamo rifatti!'
5,'Chicago\'s finest!','My wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer, and booked via Expedia. When we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its\' beauty. It\'s like something out of Europe.\r\nWe were able to get a free room upgrade, even though the rooms are still a bit small, but its\' an old hotel in an old city. It\'s there for sleeping and showering.\r\nThe restaurants, lounges, and shops were all wonderfull. The next time we travel to Chicago, I\'ll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton'
3,'Grande e impersonale','Hotel in ottima posizione, pieno centro, grandissimo e dispersivo, con tutti i pregi e difetti che un colosso del genere può comportare. stanze pulite e silenziose, letti comodi, arredi asettici. Rapporti col personale minimi ma tutto sommato cortesi e disponibili. Un difetto è la coda lunghissima per fare la prima colazione, comunque a dir poco abbondante (e costosa).'
3,'Beautiful Public Spaces','My husband and I were at The Palmer House Hilton for a business meeting. The doormen started our visit on a high note. They were extremely professional and helpful. The lobby of this hotel is beyond beautiful. The ceilings and walls were something to behold. The elevator lobbies had banquets for sitting. The hallways are lined with black and white picture of all the famous people who have either stayed here or played here. The empire room was simple elegant.The concierge staff was knowledgeable,extremely helpful and friendly. Unfortunately the rooms themselves left much to be desired. Our first room was really really small. It fit a queen bed and that was about it.There was no dresser for clothes. We asked to be moved to a larger room/ We were asked if we minded going to a handicapped accessible room.That room had a huge bathroom with a wheel in shower. That shower got the floor soaking wet.The bathroom was larger but alas, still no dresser. There were two desks but no dresser. It was late by the time we got to the second room so we decided to just deal with it. We left the room very early the next morning for meetings. By 3:30 the room had not been cleaned.Even though the staff was great, and the public areas beautiful, next time I\'ll just take the tour and stay somewhere there is room for me and my clothing.'
4,'la notte','das Hotel liegt sehr zentral direkt über dem Central Station und ist somit ein idealer Ausgangspunkt New York auch zu Fuß,oder per Bahn, zu erobern.5th Ave liegt 5 Minuten ,der Times Square 10 Minuten zu Fuß vom Hotel.Das Hyatt ist riesig, allein schon die Empfangshalle, sehr imposant.Ein und auschecken klappte sehr zügig. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet. Wir hatten zwei große Betten im Zimmer, aber ein winziges Bad. Die Klimaanlage ist nervend, sehr laut in der Nacht.Frühstücken geht man am Besten direkt vor der Türe, gegenüber des Hotels im Breakfast,liegt in einer Brücke eingebettet,mit typischen Amerikanischen Frühstück,Spiegeleier,Bratkartoffeln und Speck, sehr lecker und klasse Kaffee dazu.\r\nIm Hotel gibt es einen kleinen Supermarkt, aber sehr teuer, kleines Bier und Wasser, je 0.33l mit knapp 10 Dollar ist man dabei. Schade das im Zimmer kein Wlan kostenlos zur Verfügung steht.In der Hotelhalle kann man sich aber kostenlos in ein freies Netz einwählen.Die Bar im Hotel ist nüchtern und modern eingereichtet. Das Hotel gefällt eindeutig allein durch die Lage.'
1,'Beauty is only skin deep','The charm of this property ends with the decor, which is lovely but not enough to outweigh the minuses. \r\nThe bathroom is so small I couldn\'t sit down on the toilet. I had to step over the toilet to get out of the shower. The door to the room sticks open so I slept my first night with my door open, then had to bodyslam it to get it to shut thereafter. There\'s an iron but only a table top ironing board and not enough outlets. You can\'t keep your laptop and your iron plugged in at the same time. Got a Blackberry to charge too? Fuhgedaboudit. Ladies, don\'t bring dresses or a coat because once you put your suitcase in the closet (the only place it fits) there\'s no room for long hang anything.\r\nThe desk chair in the room is made of aluminum so dress warm to work there. If you get tired of working in your room (or perhaps claustrophobic), don\'t go to the lobby, restaurant or bar. The ever-present techno soundtrack is so loud you can\'t hear the person you\'re talking to on the phone even with the earpiece in. Besides, the restaurant food is mediocre anyway. \r\nThis place is like that hostess in the ultra-chic restaurant that looks at you as if she\'s trying to decide whether you\'re cool enough to eat there, then serves you average food at elevated prices. Stay someplace where they know that hospitality means being hospitable.'
1,'Dont waste your money','Horribly small rooms. The lobby is beautiful and fools you into thinking the rooms are very nice. Stayed in a suite for over 400$ a night. Not even coffee in the room. Old dirty couches, old bathroom tiles. \r\nThere are beautiful hotels in the city for the same price or less. i would not recommend this to anyone...'
4,'pricey but worth it','we are marriott people I own some time shares and stay at a Marriott when we can. This is nice typical level 8 Marriott property efficient check in clean well appointed rooms. It\'s location in Times Square is great if you are going to the theater in NYC. I was puzzled why the concierge lounge ws closed on the weekends so I deducted a point for that.'
4,'Good location, paper thin walls, broken TV','I booked this hotel because I\'ve been happy with Westin hotels in the past and I am a Starwood Preferred Guest. Anyway, the room was nice, I booked a spa room and the massage chair was great. Unfortunately the TV cable had issues and after three calls they gave me a replacement (with a free movie). The maids were viligant - and will wake you up at 8am unless you switch the do not disturb switch. Even with that on I was disturbed. Just doing their job but I was trying to sleep off a major case of jet lag. The walls are paper thin! I\'m amazed considering the rooms were nice and I couldn\'t hear the traffic outside. I could hear a babie cry and the toilet flush from next door! The price of room service is high - $28 for breakfast and $58 for dinner for one person! The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were devine. The bath, however is not a spa bath. Just a small tub. The two headed shower is a joke, no pressure for a massage. Not sure if I\'ll stay here again...if it is on my dime probably not. The rooms do look like the pictrures and are a little larger than I thought.'
5,'Place to stay in New York City','What a great find Affinia Manhattan is! We have stayed at many different hotels during our visits to the best city in the world but Affinia Manhattan outshines them all. I brought my preteen daughter and her friend, who had never visited NYC, during their February vacation and had the most delightful stay. The Affinia Manhattan hotel is right across from Penn Station and within walking distance to everything! Room was very roomy with two bathrooms, seperate bedroom and kitchen. Just perfect. Staff was lovely, helpful and breakfast was delightful. BRAVO!'
3,'Hip, funky, great location but needs a few tweaks!','A surprise 30th birthday present from my husband - a trip to NYC! The hotel looked amazing on website and features in some cool brochures. My husband contacted the hotel prior to arrival requesting if they could look at making my birthday extra special and to book a table at the bar for our 1st night- no one replied. After calling, the concierge staff were pretty brisk and not that friendly. I work in the hotel business and was very surprised at this. After arriving, the welcome was ok. Again quite brisk - working for hotels in Florida and Mauritius, all the staff at my hotels would not get awat with that! Anyway - we loved the hotel immediatley. Great location, very cool and good atmosphere. Our room was tiny but we knew that. I think the biggest shock was the bathroom. Sitting on the toilet - our kneeds touched the wall in front! Could have done with bigger towels and the shower head to be removable so I could have a shower without getting my hair wet (no shower caps). Bed comfortable although the AC/Heating is behind the headboard so it is a little noisy. We got used it to so no worries for us! The room walls are a bit thin and the 2nd night we did hear the bar music but so tired we fell asleep not to long after. I think a kettle/tea/coffee would have been nice but there is a drink, ice and snack station on every floor. Hairdryer needed replacing as it was hot/cold/hot/cold - not consstent heat. When I told reception they didnt believe me and send another one to the room. The same thing happend so I just let it dry naturally instead - couldnt be bothered to complain again.\r\nThe bar is great - we loved it on our 1st night! Good music and a local crowd. I would have liked the table my husband tried to organise as we were stood up for ages. Apart from that, was a good place to start out before heading to Pacha.\r\nLocation excellend! Right on the red line (1) to get down to times sq, midtown and lower manhattan. Times Warner Centre is literally 2 mins walk and we had a great meal here at Porterhouse and drinks at Stone Rose bar. Also close to central park and the lovely shops around here. Broadway/Macy\'s area is a bit touristy and tacky with beggars etc so this was perfect!\r\nWe defintley want to come back and stay at the Hudson - I just think the staff need to cheer up a little and be more friendly, the hairdryers need looking at and they should make a fuss of you on a special occasion! You only turn 30 once! We will try to book a higher category of room so we have more space and a shower over bath would be nice. Tired legs from walking all day would benefit from a nice hot bath of an evening\r\nAll in all a cool hotel but service needs improving and you MUST be aware of the room sizes before booking. We like the style and atmosphere above everything with the bonus of a fabulous location!'
4,'Location, location, location','Location is the best reason to stay at the Marriott Marquis: It\'s right in the heart of Broadway. In fact, it\'s right next to TKTS, where you go to buy same-day half-price show tickets. Our room on the 22nd floor was totally quiet, nonetheless, and we had a fairly impressive view of Broadway signage. The curtains were able to block the light out entirely while we slept, though.\r\nThe most annoying thing about the hotel, though, IMO, is the elevator system; instead of pushing your floor button inside the elevator, you have to program in the floor outside the elevator when you are calling it. The elevator then goes only to the floors that have been programmed in. BTW, the concierge is on the 8th floor, and the elevators have glass walls--for those with squeamish stomaches.'
5,'Super Hotel, aber Vorsicht mit Gospeltour buchen ...','Wir waren vom 5.9.-12.9.2012 in diesem Hotel, Zi. 3314. Super Aussicht auf den Times Square, super Betten, sehr sauber, Bad alles in Ordnung, Fön vorhanden, täglich frische Handtücher. Die Fahrstühle sind super, das Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Nur die Gospeltour auf deutsch war ein Reinfall. Kostet 59 $ pro Person. Man wird durch Harlem gefahren. Der Guide hat immer nur erzählt, wie sauber doch Harlem jetzt ist und dass sich die Straßennamen von Nummern in Namen ändern. Dann ein Gottesdienst - viel Gerede, die hatten wohl Bibelkurs, nach 1 1/2 Stunden kamen endlich die Gospelsänger, haben zwei Lieder gesungen und dann wurden wir schon wieder rausgeschmissen. Das war es. Aber keiner im Hotel hat uns gesagt, dass an diesem Sonntag die Musicalsaison am Broadway startet. Die haben wir leider verpasst. Also Hände weg von Gospeltour. In der Nähe ist eine Baptistenkirche, da kann man zu Fuß hingehen und sich das anhören.'
5,'Great Hotel','OK the hotel is a bit old fashioned but the foyer and reception are superb and the rooms are clean and comfortable.\r\nThe sirens and car horns are part of the New York \'Buzz\' and the location is great.\r\nThe bar adjoining the hotel is superb as is the bar diner over the road'
2,'Room 705 - bathroom freezing','Rooms not available on check-in. Had to wait over 1 hour for room to be cleaned.\r\nRoom 705 - spacious and comfy bed, BUT bathroom was absolutely freezing with icy draft through windows.\r\nReception staff/duty manager - not very helpful. Gave impression that they just wanted to get rid of you.\r\nBreakfast good and good location.\r\nWould not use again.'
4,'Old Hotel, great staff!!','We have stayed at the Edison on numerous occasions and have always been satisfied with the service, from the front desk staff as well as the Bellboys, housekeeping staff etc. The hotel is old, the furniture outdated , but have always found the premises clean and well maintained. The location can\'t be beat and you have everything right at your front door. Would recommend.'
4,'Great Experience!','I was a little nervous making a reservation for a hotel just based on reviews from this website, but I am glad I did! The Crowne Plaza turned out to be a great hotel located on Broadway and 49th in the middle of Times Square. We stayed from May 29- June 1, 2005 and found it to be very nice. We had a king sized bed with the most comfortable mattress and the most luxuriously soft comforter (I would like to buy one for my own bed!). I was very impressed by the fact that security was always diligent about asking to see people\'s room keys before they allowed them to access the elevators to the rooms. The rooms were clean, we had a great view, and we were centrally located within walking distance to many attractions. I was suprised that even though we were smack in the middle of Times Square, we didn\'t hear a lot of outside noise (except for the occasional ambulance or police siren). I would give the hotel 4.5 stars if it weren\'t for the thin walls. Luckily, our next door neighbors weren\'t in their rooms often, but when they were, you could hear their voices clearly though the thin walls. Also, check-in was a little slow in trying to locate a room, even though we had advanced pre-paid reservations. Overall, we couldn\'t be more pleased for the price that we paid. We would not hesitate to stay here again!'
3,'Okay hotel','The hotel is in a great location, the room was decent. My only beef was housekeeping, we had wet dirty towels that we left out to be changed and housekeeping just took them off the floor of the bathtub and rehung them, two days in a row. Also there was an empty bottle of wine and empty coffee cups left out and housekeeping just left them there. Very disappointing for the supposed quality of the hotel and the price.'
4,'Das Beste ist die Lage','Das Beste an diesem Hotel ist die Lage.\r\nFrüh am Morgen bereits im Central Park laufen, Tagsüber die Sehenswürdigkeiten besichtigen oder seine Termine wahrnehmen, abends ins Broadway Musical.\r\nAlles nur ein Paar Gehminuten entfernt.\r\nAuch der Trend-Laden Abercrombie & Fitch an der Ecke 5th mit 56th Ave liegt sehr nah.\r\nEmpfehlenswert ist auch Uncle Jack\'s Steakhouse an der 56h Ave.\r\nDas Hotel ist sehr groß, das Personal freundlich. Professionelle Hilfe bei Reservierungen bekommt man beim Concierge. Die Reinigung des Zimmers war meiner Meinung nach nicht ausreichend.'
1,'Horrible service combined with downright discusting rooms made this place a total nightmare; we went home early.','The location was great. The lobby was nice. Once you stepped off the elevator, the halls stunk. Our room smelled of some horrible stench. There was mold growing in the bathroom, the ceiling of the room and all around the window. It was so bad we went home early because we couldn\'t stand to be there one more night. that\'s not even to mention the staff. Completely incompetent, rude and unhelpful. I have no idea why they were working in the hospitality industry. Literally the worst hotel I\'ve ever stayed in and I\'ve traveled the world.'
5,'Excellent for the price','Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor, before I booked, I wasn’t expecting too much. Small beds, small rooms, but this is New York, what else could you expect.\r\nWe must have just struck lucky, large cosy room with one of the most comfortable beds ever. We ended up staying at the Hyatt for a week, in room 2441. No view, as its towards the rear of the hotel, but also very little street noise.\r\nThe cons:- Very expensive room service, $9 plus service for a coffee. No in room facilities, coffee, tea or mini-bar. (the cost of the room service put us off using other facilities in the Hotel, so I can’t comment on the bar or breakfast)\r\nThe Pros:- Excellent size room, huge comfortable bed, large LCD TV with choice of in house movies (not free). Speedy lift service (especially as the 24th floor can use either lift bank). En Suite, although not the largest, always had plenty of hot water and a good shower.\r\nI did hear other people complaining about room noise, but either we had quiet neighbours, (or they liked listening to us), or our room was jus lucky to have thicker walls.\r\nThe hotel reception is very modern and grand, but sometimes we felt it a bit impersonal. We like others, found the link to Grand Central to be very useful for the restaurants and for getting about. On our last trip to NYC we stayed at the Casablanca, which although was a lot more personal wanted to charge us more than double the rate that we obtained at the Hyatt through Expedia. We would definitely stay here again, even if both rates were the same.'
5,'Ignore the naysayers','We booked this quite a long while ago - but as I occasionally checked TripAdvisor, I saw a fair number of negative comments and was concerned as to whether we\'d done the right thing.\r\nFor sure we had - a great property - lovely spacious room - had a half price upgrade to Grand Club - and that was tremendous - lovely healthy breakfast - and the wonderful Club Terrace - an oasis of peace and calm in the madness of Manhattan.\r\nUsed the Market most nights - very useful facility.\r\nLoved our visit to Grand Hyatt on 42nd St - a really central location - could walk everywhere.'
5,'Stylish und gut','5 Punkte, da alles sauber war, gute Aussicht (11.Stock), sehr nettes Personal und im eigenen Club war auch immer was los. Größe des Raumes ist ausreichend um Koffer neben das Bett zu stellen. Mehr benötigt man nicht wenn man viel unterwegs ist. Negative Punkte von anderen sind von mir nicht nachvollziehbar'
1,'Worst Hotel Ever Stayed In !','Firstly it\'s worth pointing out that I normally only ever write reviews where I have stayed at places and found them to be ok and to hopefully put people\'s minds at rest and have never written a bad review before....\r\nI came to New York in May with my wife for 6 nights.\r\nWe booked this months in advance and specifically asked for a quiet room on a high floor as we appreciate that New York is not exactly quiet.\r\nOn arrival the foyer seemed quite nice but the receptionist didn\'t seem to have any notes of our requests (including a room upgrade as it was our anniversary). We asked for a high floor and were taken to a room on a high lever but it was opposite the lifts so obviously wouldn\'t be quiet. We were offered a room on the 8th floor which we pointed out was fairly low so were then taken to a room which I think was on the 23rd floor which was literally the very farthest room from the lift which we thought would be ok.\r\nBy this time were tired & hungy so dumped our cases into what looked like a small room and went for a bite to eat.\r\nIt was only when we came back and had a look around that we saw what a disgusting, filthy room we had been put in!\r\nThe room was very very small, the carpets were soiled & stained and the bedding was like something out of Porridge (a UK sitcom based in a prison!).\r\nTo top it all off there was an enourmous metal heating pipe running up the side of the building which was right outside of our window and gave a constant humming noise.\r\nWe decided to stay there that night as it was late and look elsewhere in the morning. I slept on the sheets as I didn\'t even want to get in the bed and spent the night itching from I hate to think what.\r\nThe next day I went to reception and said that we were leaving (he didn\'t look like it was the first time anyone had said this) and he told us to contact Expedia for a refund as the hotel does not issue refunds.\r\nWe went to the Novotel nearby which was excellent - see review - and eventually received a refund from the hotel for the nights we didn\'t stay there - at least there\'s some credit to them there.\r\nThis is the only time that I have ever felt the need to write a poor review but this really was a shocking, horrible hotel.'
5,'Great hotel in a great location','Perfect location for the theater district. Walk out the front door and you are less than a block from plays and great restaurants .Great check in person at the hotel.Wish I could remember her name). Room was clean and very presentable. I would return'
5,'Had a Ball - Will definitley be back!','I stayed at this hoel for 5 nights and had an especially pleasurable experience.\r\nThis was my first time in NYC and was nervous because I wanted to ensure my first time in the big apple was a memorable one. I am pleased to say this hotel did not disappoint!!!\r\nThe facilities in particular were impressive. The outside bar and food hall superb. Staff were attentive and polite.\r\nMy room was very comfortable and I felt the ambience in general of the hotel epitomised what NYC is all about. If your looking for a great location, a chick, fun and enjoyable hotel, I reccomend this one - you wont be disappointed.'
5,Amazing,'Just got back from a holiday in new york city and i stayed at the westin, it was an amazing hotel.the staff were amazing and they gave a great warm welcome and they told us to feel at home. it was a quick check in and we stayed on the 39th we had an amazing view of the empire state building and times square.\r\nSara in bar 10 was a lovely and she was always smiling!\r\nthe concierge couldnt do enough for us and she always made sure we were okay.\r\nnew york is such an amazing place and id recommend staying here to anyone.\r\nonly downside is the price of the room service its disgraceful, \r\nbut other than that please go here, its a lovely place !'
5,Wow!,'Westin New York was to be my accomodation for my first trip to NYC which I won in a competition so I can\'t comment on value for money.\r\nI chose the Westin from a list of others as it looked very modern, clean and comfortable. And it is.\r\nHuge entrance/foyer. Friendly business like reception. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Westin do this heavenly bed and heavenly bath thing where they pay so much attention to detail over all sorts of little things (see their website). Massive bed and good views across the city.\r\nGreat location around the corner from Times Square. Good subway links. Has a Starbucks within the hotel which is handy and has starbucks coffee for the percolator in the room.\r\nWould definitely go back'
4,'Unique, not for everyone','My husband and I had decided to stay one night in NYC after dropping our daughter at camp. It was very last minute and we got an amazing deal on Priceline. After being matched to the Hudson Hotel, we were thrilled when we checked out the hotel\'s website and saw how interesting and cool it looked. And, when we checked out room rates on the hotel\'s site, we had paid less than half of what the least expensive room cost. Which is an amazing deal in NYC!! I have paid more to stay in a Holiday Inn.\r\nThe standard room we got was TINY but thoughtfully designed with lots of unique touches. Yes, they were trying hard to be hip and sometimes you\'d wonder about the idea behind some of the things. But, frankly, it was a refreshing change of pace for us - we live in a traditional antique colonial home - and so it was fun. Like staying in someone else\'s life for a night! I found the room to be very cozy in a good way - like a ship\'s cabin. But, granted, I was only staying for one night, had a tiny overnight bag, and was not making this my home base for a week of exploring NYC. The bed was low to the floor, with a firm mattress but still very comfortable. Down pillows & down comforter, plus nice pure white sheets, duvet, and bedding which is about a million times better than the usual scratchy, multi colored ugly patterned bedspreads you find in chains.\r\nThe bathroom was so small that it had us laughing. Really, it was MINISCULE. I have never seen such a small bathroom. If you are a big or tall person, you simply would be unable to use it. As it is, I am only 5 feet tall, and when I sat on the toilet my knees touched the wall in front of me. That said, it was immaculate and had very nice toiletries. Lighting was dim but manageable. The toilet was running continuously when we arrived but my husband fixed it and we had no other problems.\r\nOne of the shower\'s walls is glass and it opens into the bedroom so that you can see in the bedroom and someone can see you.\r\nFor privacy, there are sheer white curtains placed strategically around the bath & bedroom.\r\nAs for other people\'s complaints. We were on the 8th floor and the only noise we heard was the occasional horn honking outside. The staff was very professional. The hallways are in fact painted dark charcoal gray - top to bottom and are quite dim. Sets an interesting mood. As you are only in the halls for about 30 seconds, I didn\'t find it to be a problem. But, if I were a woman traveling alone, I could see it being a little creepy. Also, the elevator was about 100 degrees and it did have funky music playing at all hours.\r\nThe outdoor private bar/park space, the roof space and the library were simply amazing. Particularly the lush greenery on the two outdoor spaces. An oasis in the big city. It\'s truly memorable to have a drink on the cool patio space. But you pay for the experience with the astronically expensive drinks. We had 3 drinks total (1 beer and 2 cocktails) and with the tip the bill amounted to just under the cost of our room!!\r\nAll in all, Hudson is a unique place which for us was an unexpectedly fun, hip, stylish - and affordable - night in the city. It is not for everyone but then what is?'
2,'Good location but lousy room','I stayed at Pennsylvania hotel for five nights in june 2006. The location is fantastic, opposite Madison Square garden. \r\nThe check-in was fast (we arrived in the evening). Though it\'s a huge hotel, there where many elevators so you didn\'t have to wait long to get up and down. Our room was on the 15th floor.\r\nWe had a room for three persons. It was quite small. There was no wardrobe where you could hang your clothes, and no place for the shoes, and also no place to put the suitcases except on the floor. When we came, there where towels for only one person, but roomservice was quite fast and brought some more. \r\nIn the bathroom the tap was dripping during the whole stay. The plumber obviously tried to fix it but without results. Fortunately you could close the door to the bathroom so it didn\'t disturb our sleep. The zink was also quite clogged, the plumber couldnt fix that either.\r\nSo the rooms are not very good, but if you are not very particular the location excuses a lot.'
4,'Joe Hume Sydney Australia','Hotel staff were friendly and room on the 14th floor was very clean.Street noise as in most places in New York was very loud but can be decreased by wearing ear plugs.Tour information and booking desk staff were very helpful in suggesting sites to be visited.Overall a great hotel to stay at without paying the earth.Very handy to Subway transport and Times Square and the Empire State Building.Do not be swayed by a lot of the negative reviews.This hotel is more than adequate for a first time visitor to New York.'
4,'Not to bad','I had booked this hotel before seeing the reviews for it I then got worried but after being there it was not bad at all yes the plaster is falling off Walls and ceilings in some places and there was a damp smell but soon got used to it. But for what you need the room for you couldn\'t ask for more the only problem I had with the hotel was the doorman was very rude and it seemed like he needed a good slap. Maids came round every day and made beds. The hotel is in need of a make over I think every thing has been left since Glenn millar stayed there but apart from that I really enjoyed my stay here'
4,'Great Location for the Young and the Not-So-Young','This is a wonderful location traveling with young children and their grandparents! My 5 year old son loves trains so being at the Grand Central Terminal was perfect! It was very convenient for three generations of us to enjoy the gorgeous decor, wonderful food and shopping, and easy means of transportation throughout the city. The Grand Hyatt is a very nice, convenient, and comfortable hotel for all 19 of us (ranging from age 5 to 88 years old). We had a very enjoyable 3-day stay before boarding our 7-day New England Cruise on the Princess Carribean. My in-laws had a terrific 60th Anniversary Celebration which began at the Grand Hyatt in New York City!!!'
5,'Elegance, Location & Romantic','Have stayed here numerous times; staff always courteous and rooms have an old world charm. Walking distance to many places you will want to see. Millenium Park, Michigan Ave, Shopping and Theaters. Also, close by train systems. Including the one for Indiana.\r\nThe restaurant there is good but service was lacking on the day we were there. Wait staff too busy or not attentive to there tables.\r\nRooms are beautiful, quiet and clean. Excellent choice while in Chi town'
5,'best location','I stayed at the Edison Hotel in March 2005. It is located just off Times Square. You walk out of the the hotel, turn right and within the next 20 seconds your standing in the square. This hotel is decorated in an art noveau style and is really stunning as you walk towards the reception area. They have a cafe/breakfast area next door but accessible through the hotel where you go in the mornings which doesn\'t look much, but does nice food. This hotel is quite a way from areas such as the staute of liberty etc but it so easy to get around New York with millions of yellow taxis and the subway aswell. I\'d recommend this hotel because its extremely good value for money. The rooms are comfortable and clean with huge televisions, they are quite basic rooms but you can upgrade to better rooms. The Edison is a short walk to resturant row which i\'d recommend you to visit as there numerous restaurants which serve great food at good prices. \r\nFor shopping theirs obviously Macy\'s, Saks which is similar to Macys, then next to the World Trade Centre site there is a shop called Century 21 which is like a TK Max but better! \r\nBe careful if you walk through Battery Park as when were passing through, there was an audience surrounding a group of breakdancers, we joined the crowd and were nearly pick pocketed! \r\nThe Empire State builiding is a must see from what i can remember this was quite a walk from the hotel, but as before it is still easy to get to with taxis etc.'
3,'Good Location','We stayed here in March before catching and after catching a cruise. \r\nBefore we caught the cruise boat, we were given an outdated two bedroom suite. It hadn\'t been renovated and wasn\'t very nice and wasn\'t cheap either.\r\nOn our second stay at the Hilton, we were given a newer two bedroom suite that had been recently renovated and it was much better than the first room we were given, although it didn\'t have a mini fridge. \r\nI am a Hilton Honours member so we got free breakfast which was very nice.'
4,'Generally good hotel with a few issues','I was generally happy with my stay. Good rate. Clean room and huge by NYC standards. Great decor. Quiet hotel. One of the best locations in NYC. It\'s close to Times Square, 5th ave shopping, Central Park, Rock Center, Bryant Park. \r\nOnly two drawbacks to note. Horrible, wi-fi. I paid $20/day for wi-fi that was intermittent at best. That made it very hard to get work done. Few dinner options in the hotel other than super expensive room service and a small bar menu. There are tons of restaurants nearby, but if you are a tired business traveller that doesn\'t want to fight restaurant crowds-beware. I just wanted to chill in hotel and get some food there, but had to eat from the micro mini bar menu.'
2,'Yuk...I thought Americans had higher standards','My sister and I stayed at this hotel in November. The check in was okay and they let us check in early. A bit of advice - if they tell you you are to early and have to come back, don\'t go to the diner attached to the hotel to wait as it is soooooo expensive and eating in New York is reasonably cheap.\r\nThe hotel pics paint a nice picture, but the corridors and rooms are soooooo run down I was amazed and so disappointed!!!\r\nI thought Americans had high standards as they complain about everything in other countries but this hotel was not good. I can’t believe how many guests it holds, how busy it is and how shabby it is. Don’t stay here if you have any allergies or are asthmatic as it will probably hospitalise you and I am not exaggerating. The walls and carpets are all stained. The ac and heater are disgusting and covered in rust. There is mould everywhere. Oh I could go on!\r\nThe only good thing is the location and the fact that it is relatively cheap by New York standards. However I have been to NYC several times and would advise staying in a nice hotel a bit further outside town if you can’t afford the waldorf but want to stay somewhere nice as the subways are a great way to whiz around and the taxis aren’t to expensive.\r\nA couple of touristy things to do include the obvious\r\n- A show on Broadway. Book a ticket directly at the theatre as they are much cheaper.\r\n- The station island ferry is free.\r\n- Macys and tiffany’s is a must.\r\n- Bubba Gumps on Times Square is great for dinner one night and have the shrimp platter - $20 and it’s amazing. Plus they do strawberry daiquiris \r\n- China town is a must for your fakes (you have to get off the subway at the canal street stop)\r\n- Soho has great shops\r\nAvoid NY in the summer as it gets really hot and is not the best idea if you are shopping or dragging a boyfriend/husband around with you. April/May is a great time to go as is the winter months running up to xmas as it gets very festive.\r\nIf you want a prolonged stay or to get some sunbathing in either head to the hamptons or jump on a plane for £60 return from New York to Miami!'
5,'Can\'t say enough nice things about this hotel','We were headed to the city to catch a couple of Broadway shows, and were hoping to stay near Times Square, if at all possible. After realizing that all of the hotels in Time Square were well out of our price range, I found the Westin. Not cheap by any means, in fact, I\'d stack it up against any of the Times Square hotels for amenities and comfort. But the price was significantly better, all for a room a whole whopping block away. \r\nThe value for the location isn\'t even half the story, though. The staff at the Westin was freaking fantastic. It was our first visit, but they treated us as though we had been staying there for years. They remembered our name, and, on several occasions, went out of their way to make sure we were having the best possible stay.\r\nSuffice it to say, this trip moved Westin to the top of my list for hotel choices.'
3,'Beautiful Hotel, Great History, Small room, Everything over-priced','Our family went along with my husband to a conference at the Palmer. A beautiful hotel with a facinating history. I read Driser\'s Sister Carrie after our stay and enjoyed reading about characters staying in the Palmer. \r\nAll the main lobbies were brilliant. Coming from a State that has pretty much banned indoor smoking, I was a little taken a back by the over-whelming smell of cigarette smoke in the main lobby. I guess I\'m used to not smelling cigarettes in enclosed spaces anymore (even though the lobby is huge, the smell was very present). The small elavator lobbies were also very nice. Our room was very, very small. We booked very late--a possible reason why. I was not impressed with the room at all considering the price. The bathroom was even more ridiculously small. We also heard the EL run all night long, but it did not take long to get used to that.\r\nThe service was first rate. Except for the cleaning service who regularly tried to come into our room too early to clean even though we had our Do NOT Disturb sign on the door!? \r\nThe pool and hot tub area are not that nice, esp. for a hotel of this reputation. The pool was was too cold to get into and the hot tub is just not a very nice hot tub. Not impressed there. \r\nProximity to many downtown locations and it\'s historical value made it a fun visit for our family. Not the best place to bring kids. Next time we\'ll go alone or stay in the \'burbs.'
4,'Great location, good service, good ambience','Just took a break in Chicago to see architecture, museums, take in some plays, etc.. Selected for location and that could not be better. Good service at check-in. Room was fine, did have a Chicago-type view. Furnished for a single business traveller but when we asked for another bed-side lamp it arrived promptly. Bathroom needs some upgrading but very comfortable overall. Had dinner in Lockwoods on arrival and breakfast on last day; both were good & not unreasonable. Great lobby. We would happily return.'
4,'Great location in downtown Chicago','My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights to attend a wedding that was there this past weekend. For the price we paid, I thought it was a very good value. The hotel is located within a few blocks of the train that travels to/from O\'Hare airport, which made it very convenient for us. Additionally, there are so many shops and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel that we didn\'t need to walk far for anything we needed.\r\nThe hotel is huge and upon entering the lobby, it is very beautiful and impressive with the high painted ceilings and elaborate decor. We arrived around noon and had no trouble checking in early, which was nice. Our room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. My only complaints about the room were regarding the bathroom. It was nicely decorated and clean, but just very small. I liked the deep tub, but the water pressure was so low that it took a long time to fill the tub. Other than that, we were very comfortable in the room and had plenty of space for our bags and clothes.\r\nThe wedding reception we attended at the hotel was in a beautiful ballroom, and we enjoyed the food we ate there and at brunch the following morning in the hotel restaurant. Also, I appreciated that one of the doormen went out of his way to help us find a cab that would bring us to the suburbs (for the church wedding ceremony) for a flat fee. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others visiting Chicago.'
1,'1 star hotel','Being without an hotel during the marathon week, we have been directed there because it seemed to be the only one with some room available.\r\nPersonnel very unpolite, we arrived in the morning before the room was ready and we had to pay for the luggage deposit. \r\nThe room was horrible, smelly and with the carpet all worn out. It would be fine for a 1 star hotel, but having paid 300$ (without breakfast) for a room like this...\r\nIt\'s incredible how it looks good if you visit their website, do not let them fool you!'
5,'Awesome Hotel - Broadway right at our feet!','This past weekend I traveled to New York City on a bus trip. We stayed at this fabulous hotel. The rooms were fine and the beds were comfortable. On the top of this hotel is a rotating restaurant & lounge - The View! And it was spectacular - the view, that is. The drinks were between $16 and $20 for wine or martinis. This was my first introduction to the prices in NYC. Wow...but that\'s a story for another time. The lobby is on the 8th floor...which was fine....the elevators are dead-center in the hotel...and you must enter the floor # that you want on a keypad...which then tells you what LETTER elevator to use. This may be confusing to those who are not used to this type of technology...but once you get the hang of it...it\'s fine. We were located right across the street from the Lunt-Fontaine Theatre where we saw The Addams Family. Totally enjoyed the hotel...within walking distance to Times Square, Grand Central Station, zillions of restaurants. Go. You\'ll enjoy it...but bring lots of $$$!!!!'
1,'Tiny, noisy, shaky room, cheap furniture, expensive food','nice decoration of public areas but tiny room with minimal, cheap furniture. staying at 2 floor above lobby where the club is - the music was so loud that the whole room was shaking due to the bass. and it went on whole night. extremely poor sound isolation. extremely limited choices of food was at four seasons pricing but of fast food quality. e.g. 10 dollars for cookies + surcharges.'
3,'Può essere un affare ma... Occhio a non farsi fregare!!','Nonostante la posizione sia veramente magnifica e l\'albergo abbia una hall promettente bisogna stare molto attenti al momento dell\'assegnazione delle camere: vi sono dei piani (es. il 3 e quelli più bassi) che sono al limite della putrescenza, vecchi, bui, maleodoranti e le cui stanze sono piccole, esageratamente vecchie, buie, polverose, con muri dall\'intonaco cadente e mobili da pattumiera (tenete presente il film il principe cercamoglie!?). Se vi capitasse una situazione di questo genere PROTESTATE e fatevi assegnare un\'altra camera: noi abbiamo fatto così e ci hanno assegnato una stanza al 14° piano: siamo così passati  dalla... notte al giorno, piano luminoso, senza cattivi odori, moderno, pulito, con stanza ampia, caratterizzata da mobili nuovi, nel complesso pulita e più che dignitosa... persino con affaccio sull\'Empire S. B. !!\r\nIn sostanza, visti i prezzi di New York e la posizione strategica, questo albergo può quindi essere un compromesso più che buono ma bisogna prestare molta attenzione a non farsi fregare!!'
3,'Excellent value hotel for central Manhattan','Having read some terrible reviews of this hotel, I was very nervous about going there with my teenage daughter. I needn\'t have been. Yes, the hotel is old and a bit dated, but it was perfectly clean, although there was some rust on the fitting under the sink. However, rust is not dirt. We were not in one of the refurbished rooms and so the furniture was quite old but everything worked - TV, air con, all lights, hairdryer, etc. The shower was brilliant. We actually stayed on 2 separate occasions, on our way to and from Niagara Falls, the rooms were on different floors but both were perfectly acceptable. All the staff were helpful and there were plenty of places to eat. The location was brilliant, right opposite Penn Station (where you can get the Air Train to Newark) and just a few minutes walk from Times Square, Empire State, Macy\'s, Manhattan Mall etc. This is not an expensive hotel and travellers must accept that not everything will be shiny new but we had no problems and would definitely stay there again.'
2,Disappointed,'There are some pluses to the Hotel Edison: it\'s close to Times Square; the check-in, security, and housekeeping staff are friendly; the price doesn\'t kill your budget. However, the negatives far outweight the positives, I\'m afraid. \r\nI stayed with three friends. There was mould growing on the bathtub and up the wallpaper in the corner by the window. The faucet was loose and almost detached from the sink. There was no fan ventilation in the bathroom, so after a shower the entire room was like a sauna *and* the condensation fell like rain on your head (literally!) At one point our water was *brown*, at another it stopped working altogether. Only enough hot water for two showers in the morning. There were only two available open electrical outlets in the entire room (one in the bathroom, one in the corner by the mould strip by the window) -- both of which were loose, so when you plugged something in, the cord just fell right out again! The chair in our room was dingy and threadbare. No coffee machine or other average amenities that you find in even a Super 8!\r\nI\'d also recommend that the hotel invest in vibrating pagers (or something similar) for use when waiting for the valet service to bring the car around. I know they\'re busy, but we had a 45 minute wait standing around in the lobby with *no* chairs, and one of our party was pregnant. Not very cool.\r\nI\'m not normally a picky person when it comes to hotel rooms. Something like threadbare furniture I would normally disregard. But added in to all the other issues, the room was really barely livable -- esp. the mould issues and the dangers of the electrical outlets. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this hotel.'
3,'I love NY!','L\'albergo è davanti alla Penn station e Madison Square Garden, vicinissimo a macy\'s, cinque minuti a piedi da Time square, anche la quinta si trova a 5 minuti, Central Park non è lontano, la posizione è stupenda sia per quando si arriva e parte dagli aeroporti che per girare a piedi. L\'albergo ha una hall molto grande in sitle e luminosa, molti ascensori,i bar negozzi già all\'interno del complesso alberghiero. \r\nPer quanto riguarda le camere il discorso è un altro: sono puliti e il cambio asciugamani e pulizia viene fatta quotidianamente, i letti sono comodi, l\'acqua calda in doccia arriva in pochi attimi. L\'aspetto non è molto gradevole pareti scrostate, pavimento moquette logora, porte vecchie, mancanza assoluta di interventi periodici manutentivi, pittura e cambio della moquette...\r\nNon comprendo perchè non si attivino negli interventi manutenivi che darebbero tutt\'altro aspetto alla struttura che potrebbe essere veramente favolosa!\r\nIl prezzo pagato comuque non è stato alto e le signore delle pulizie fanno il loro dovere, la posizione è ottima quindi lo consiglio se è in offerta, altrimenti a parità di prezzo direi di orientarsi su qualche holiday Inn Express o Comfort Inn che sono sparsi in tutto il centro della città, alcuni molto vicini al Penn, ed hanno un aspetto decisamente più moderno!'
3,'Hotel très bien situé!','Après avoir regardé certains avis et photos j\'étais très angoissée d\'avoir réservé cet hotel (offre last minute) \r\nEn réservant cet hotel il ne faut pas s\'attendre non plus au grand luxe mais vous y trouverez certains avantages :\r\nSituation géographique exeptionnelle face au madison square garden à deux pas de l\'ESB et de penn station à qqs pas de times square.\r\nPersonnel serviable \r\nLe bruit dans les chambres et largement supportable (sirènes et autres!)\r\nLe prix pour l\'emplacement\r\nLes - de cet hotel : \r\nLa literie plutot moyenne, les sanitaires propres mais vétustes. \r\nPas de wifi (internet payant )\r\nNous gardons un bon souvenir de notre séjour et nous retournerions sans problème dans cet hotel.'
5,'Awesome place','We have stayed here 4 times in the last 10 years. This hotel is top notch, safe, friendly, and customers are their number one. The room was clean with a great view. We had upgraded a few days before we came and the breakfast we were told was included but once we go there we found out it was not. But they offered us vouchers fo the restaurant. They handled every thing with class and a high level of awesomeness. Jon the Prioirity Club ...worth it. Thanks Crowne Plaza Times square..you are awesome.'
4,'Great Stay!','I stayed here on Friday night, April 22nd. The location is great, easy walk to the the theatre district and walking back @ 10pm was no problem. Access to Starbucks and a great little grocery and take-out place @ 55th & 6th.\r\nRoom on the 35th floor was clean and comfortable. I have to agree about the thin walls. Although my neighbors did not stay up late, I could hear their conversations and laughing quite clearly.\r\nAll in all, I recommend this Hilton.'
4,'Convenient, clean, cordial.','I had not been to NYC in 40 years - since I was 18 - and really didn\'t know what to expect for such reasonable rates. I had all pleasant surprises. The location is amazing. Standard double room was small, but clean, and the beds are VERY comfortable. Felt very comfortable with security. Staff was efficient, helpful and cordial. Lobby is small, but has beautiful art deco decor, and holiday decorations were traditional and beautiful. Will definitely return to The Edison, and I plan to make a NYC visit quarterly to make up for those 40 years.!'
2,'Hudson Hotel-DON\'T STAY','If you\'re a regular 3-4 star hotel-goer and are used to comfortable settings and a lavish look of the room, this hotel is NOT for you. We booked on priceline and ended up with this hotel. We decided to check out a day early and booked the Grand Hyatt for the final night. The Hudson is very modern, so if you\'re in to that, stay there. The hotel room was not VERY small, but it is small. Since they wanted it to be trendy and hip, it comes across very cold. The beds are a few inches from the floor and the walls are panelled. There are not features in the room to soften it. So, if you\'re used to curtains, comforters and more things in a hotel room to make it seem warmer, don\'t stay here. I\'m sure it is great for people who like a very modern look and feel and can do without that warm feeling. The water was turned off throughout one night due to maintenence and our water didn\'t work a few times. The staff did come immediately and fix it. The staff were very friendly, but this is not Ritz Carlton service if that is what you are used to. In regard to an artsy hotel, the two bars are very cool and artistic...so if you\'re going for the atmosphere, this is neat. If you\'re only into location, this is in a very good location. Right near Columbus Circle and convenient to the Subway. Not a long way to Central Park or to Times Square.'
1,'1 hour wait in line to check in','Looks nice on the outside, great location, and it\'s over an hour wait in line to check in, because they only have one person at the desk for an insanely long line. Then the room! The bathroom was full of black mold the tub was NASTY and drripping. Repair this place!'
4,'Excellent établissement','Nous avons séjourné dans cet hotel du 5 au 11 Août 2011 en famille avec nos deux filles de 18 et 15 ans, l\'établissement est parfaitement situé en face du Madison Square Garden et de Penn Station, à 10mns à pied de Times Square.\r\nAccueil agréable et bonne efficacité de la réception, une de nos réservations ayant été annulée pour des raisons inconnues, le problème a été résolu en quelques minutes(thanks to Vanessa) et trés bon soutien du desk pour l\'organisation des différentes activités pendant le séjour (Messe gospel dans le Bronx, visites.....) .\r\nNous avions une chambre et une chambre studio situées au 11 et 13ieme étages avec coin repas parfaitement équipé( four MO, réfrigérateur,cafetière,vaiselle et petit coin repas) rénovées de fraîche date et en parfait état, le coin repas a été particulièrement apprécié pour les petites pauses réparatrices au décours des longues déambulations new yorkaises.\r\nPetit bémol pour les touristes fumeurs: pas d\'espace fumeur dans cet établissement en dépit de sa classification hoteliere mais celà paraît devenir la règle partout en relation avec le durcissement des lois anti-tabac\r\nAu total donc excellent établissement pour une première découverte sans souci de la grosse pomme ....et d\'éventuels séjours ultérieurs.'
4,'Super !','Très bel hôtel. Superbement bien situé. Personnel accueillant et souriant. Quoi qu\'en disent certains, les chambres sont très propres ! Il y a effectivement une machine à café dans la chambre et 3 recharges (ainsi que des recharges de thés) La femme de chambre nous donnait autant de recharges que nécessaires! Demandé poliment et accompagné d\'un sourire... Il est aussi de bonne convenance de laisser un tips Pour ma part, chaque jour, je laissais 2$ sur le meuble Tv accompagné d\'une petite attention écrite et sympa. Il y a eu quelques problèmes de personnel au moment de l\'ouragan et par la suite...effectivement. L\'hôtel s\'est justifié du fait qu\'une grande partie des employés avaient été soit directement victimes ou sinistrés des suites de Sandy, soit ils ne pouvaient tout simplement pas arriver jusqu\'à leur travail. C\'était tout à fait justifiable !!! Mais,bon ça on le comprend, ou pas !\r\nPour le petit déjeuner, il y a plein d\'endroits géniaux aux alentours. Chez Joe bars(le +copieux), à l\'hôtel Edison(le +typique), chez Junior(le +près) etc... Starbuck ? Ben ouais et un Mc Do à midi ?\r\nJe souhaite à tous les prochains chanceux, un très bon séjour à NY et au Marquis. Conseil; pour bien profiter de votre séjour dans la grande pomme, laissez la culture européenne en Europe et l\'arrogance française (malheureusement tristement célèbre) en France ! Vous n\'en passerez qu\'un plus beau séjour.'
3,'Albergo un po\' troppo caro per quel che offre!','Ho trascorso dal 24 al 31 dicembre al Crowne Plaza di Times Square. Nulla di dire sulle camere (anche se un po\' piccole con quello che si paga!!!), pulite, letto molto comodo.\r\nLa mia camera era situata al 42° piano con vista su Times Square (camera 4211), dalla camera potevo tranquillamente regolare la temperatura.\r\nLa camera era dotata di macchina del caffè con cialde (free) che abbiamo utilizzato tutti i giorni. \r\nLa posizione è veramente ottima \'al centro del mondo\', la vista stupenda ma mi aspettavo qualcosa di più visto la spesa :)\r\nQuasi dimenticavo....il primo giorno ho fatto colazione (con mio figlio) alla \'Brasserie 1605\': 2 breakfast self service e due cappuccini per la modica spesa di 86 $!!!!'
5,'I Loved This Hotel!','This hotel has everything you could possibly want! I absolutely loved it. It is located directly across the street from the Minskoff Theatre and Juniors (famous for their cheesecake). It is in walking distance to Central Park, Trump International Hotel and Tower, Bad Boy Entertainment Worldwide, and the starting point for tour buses. The glass elevators move between floors so fast that you think you are on a ride in an amusement park. I loved it! The View restaurant on the top floor is awesome. Well, the view from the restaurant is awesome; the buffet is terrible. If you don\'t mind paying $30/person for cold food, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, don\'t eat the buffet! It\'s not worth the money. Valet parking is $50/night. There is a parking garage directly across the street (next to Juniors) that is a lot less expensive. Enjoy! This is a fabulous place to stay. And it\'s worth every penny!'
5,'Yes it is pricey - but you get what you pay for!','Pricey and busy - but exceptional service in a great location. We have stayed elsewhere & enjoyed it - but the Marquis will now be our NY home! Room and bath was quite large for NY; maid service was excellent, and all special requests were handled promptly. No issue with storage of luggage (checking in or out); or with elevator wait times. Our room had a great view of times square - which was wonderful in the late afternoon when we were worn out - could just sit & watch the world go by! Also was great after the theatre - instead of fighting the crowds at a restaurant, we popped into Junior\'s (right across the street) got carry-out, and took it up to the room! (and somewhat unusual for NY - the room has a coffeepot!) The upgrade often costs $$$ - but in our opinion it was worth it. When figuring costs, we also realized that we saved on cab fares being in this hotel, as we could walk to all theatres, rock center, etc. In addition to Juniors\', there is a Starbucks in the lobby and on the street level of the hotel. Exercise room also overlooks times sq - all in all, a great property which we highly recommend!'
1,'Screwed up my reservation','I was told by the Hudson that I could cancel by a certain time and I did... They charged my credit card anyway and I had to put the charge under dispute with my credit card company. And, I must add that the reservation rep was the most rude imaginable. Even though the Hudson looks like a wonderful hotel that I truly wanted to visit, my views have changed due to the unprofessionalism of its reservation staff.'
4,'Crown Plaza New York - Great Location','Great Location, close to everything. Hotel is very upbeat, room was little disappointing cramped for a family and services such as internet acess that is normally included was not, also cost for Gym again items you expect. Given that Wifii was free in MaDonalds and around New York, it did not make sense. I would not recommend the hotel\'s restarant.'
3,'Newly renovate rooms. Lobby still under renovation','If you are just looking for a place to sleep this hotel was very nice. The rooms are newly renovated so they were nice and clean and a good size. The lobby was still under construction so there wasn\'t anyone to talk to for help. Also there was no resturant or lounge in the hotel at this time, but I think it\'s in the plans as part of the renovations. \r\nVery Very good location if you are looking to hang around time square.'
3,'You pay for the location, and the mouse in the room too','There was a mouse in my room. There is little water pressure in the shower and they are hard to turn off; if you\'re not careful it will run and run. The hotel is not one of the cheapest but there are deals to be had via Expedia and such like. The location was totally fantastic. Could not have asked for better in that regard I could have asked.for free WiFi, and think that it is not too much to ask for. Would recommend only for the location, nothing else, be warned.'
4,'Great Hotel in the Heart of Times Square','Very comfortable room with a great view of Times Square. The location is perfect for going to shows and getting to the subway . The iron in the room stained my wife\'s blazer, but they had it dry cleaned free of charge. Overall a great stay!'
2,'The Worst Musty and Moldy Hotel in NYC','Hotel Pennsylvania was awful. The check in and check out times took 2 hours each an no matter what time of day there was always a long line and only 1-3 people working the front desk. The website says it is a historic hotel which has been renovated and it is completely untrue. The hotel does not even have a public restroom in the lobby.The hallways and rooms smelled like must, the rooms have old dirty brown carpet, the walls look like they have never been painted, the beds were very small and uncomfortable, the bathroom ceiling was full of mold, the shower was dirty, and the hair dryer even caught on fire. The website said we would receive a free continental breakfast however, it failed to mention that this was only true if you were part of the 500 club. We had to pay to check our bags and then we had to bring them down into the creepy basement to drop them off. We tried to complain and were hung up on by the front desk staff and even the manager. They kept telling us to take up our complaints with Expedia. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.'
1,'Seriously, don\'t stay here!','1) After a long journey to NYC including fighting our way walking through 7th Ave Mayhem, we got to Park Central at 3pm, apparently they have a strict policy not to let anyone check in until 4! There were a long line at the counter, 4 people at the desk and 1 other staff to direct the line, but only 2 staff were helping the customers to check-in. After the staff looked through my documents and everything at the check-in counter, he told us that we got there too early! We had to wait \'till 4 to check in. He also asked if we wanted to check in our bags, and each bag will be charge for $1.50 for each bag, then told us to get back in line to check in another hour.\r\nOnce we got to the hotel, it had a very nice view and the room size was decent. I went to check out the bathroom and the toiletries. The shower curtain had boogers with blood stain on it. The toiletries were formulated in Switzerland and they were really made in China!\r\nThere was a hotel magazine and found the cover were covered by numerous human boogers looking objects (not one but a LOT).We were NOT happy, esp. after waiting in line for a long time. We wished that someone (e.g. The person that direct the line) or a SIGN that could have told us earlier!\r\nAs mentioned, after a long journey getting to the hotel, we just wanted to relax and be settle!\r\n2) after we paid $300s a night, you want us to keep paying all the little things $1.50 to check in each bag and another $14.10 for internet per night?! Even Motel 6 offers freer wifi!\r\nWe felt that the hotel constantly tried to rip us off with all those extra fees!\r\n3) the staff at the front desk couldn\'t offer us a map of area, so we could find the restaurant that we are looking for?! Or was the map another $10???\r\n4) the cleanliness was unacceptable! Would you also like in the hotel room where things are covered by questionable objects?\r\n5) again, after paying $300s hotel and foolishly thinking that the hotel was a 4-star hotel, the hotel is that low that it can only offer made in china toiletries? I I mean, REALLY?!'
4,'Another Great Stay','This was our 4th time staying at The Edison and we are already booked to stay again in October. We valeted our car this time and the guys were more than nice. They even offered us directions to find the Lincoln Tunnel on our way home. Check in was a breeze. We arrived at 1:00pm and Youssie (spelling?) was so nice. He had a room ready for us even though it was 2 hours before check in time. We were in room 901, a remodeled handicap room (although we are not handicapped). The room was very spacious, had new bedding, a flat-screen, and a nice big remodeled bathroom. A slight downfall was the shower, as it was a handicap shower. There is no tub to hold the water in, so you have to keep turning the water off during your shower, or else the water pools up quickly and the whole bathroom floor would be covered in water. We quickly realized this and became pros at military showers lol. Also, there would be an occasional unpleasant odor coming from the bathroom. We chalked it up to be sewage, but it was very slight and only occured maybe twice the whole trip. The beds were comfy and the room was very clean. Add that to the great location, and why wouldn\'t you stay here? The Edison may not be the most modern of hotels in the city, but the price is right, the location is fabulous, and the service is terrific.'
4,'Good location, nice hotel','We stayed at Park Central Hotel at the end of January and found it to be perfectly fine. The Location was great, the reception and staff was very good, the room was also very good and very clean. The only negative I have was that the room was a bit cold at night, I asked for an extra blanket in the morning and one was delivered when we arrive back that evening. I would definatley go back again. Hope in spring though when it\'s warmer :-).'
5,'Great stay, perfect location','I stayed at the New Yorker with my husband for 7 days mid May, we both had a wonderful time, we were out most of the day so mainly used the room as a place to crash or have a mid afternoon rest before venturing out again. The location is fantastic, within walking distance to all major sites and very close to subways and buses.\r\nThe room was very clean and modern, we stayed on the 23rd floor (room 2333) and had a great view of the Empire State building out of our window!! :o) Didn\'t have any issues with street noise as we were so high up. Ok, the rooms are on the small side especially compared to European standards, but space is at a premimum in New York and I have heard that most NYC hotels have tiny rooms so was kind of expecting this. However, we were given two double beds for no extra charge which was handy as it meant that our room was bigger than average. The bathroom was a little dated but served its purpose and had lots of toiletries and towels (wish they had proper bath towels rather than lots of small hand towels, but that\'s me being picky) never had any issues with hot water as some other guests mentioned. All the staff we came to contact with were very pleasant and friendly and check in and check out was fast. There are a number of lifts in the lobby which service this massive hotel, they were very efficient and you rarely had to wait long to catch one.\r\nBreakfast was not included, but with so many restaurants and cafes around, this was not a problem- loved Jumba juice bar- gorgeous smoothies and they do a tasty egg and spinich toasted tortilla wrap - yum!! We tried out the Tic Toc Diner for breakfast one time (diner attached to the hotel) after hearing so many good reviews. Once was enough, it was ok, but very average. There are much better places out there for a better price. We tried out Ellen\'s Stardust Diner for the experience one lunch time, it was very cheesy, but had a great fun factor with wannabe theatical performers singing tracks from popular Broadway shows whilst you eat, worth going and try the milkshakes- 1000\'s of calories but VERY nice. (on 1650 Broadway). For a nice dinner try Ruby Tuesdays- on 7th Ave (between 41st/42nd St) we had the most delicious steak which cut through like butter, great staff and they even gave us free starter as we waited \'long\' (only 15 mins!). \'Vergils\' steak house on the otherhand not so good, humongeous portions (one starter and main shared -main only half eaten) huge but not great quality, we found the meat to be overly salty and fatty.\r\nTop of the Rock (Rockerfeller Center) very worth seeing and is better than Empire State building, look up \'High line\' park on top of a dis-used railway track about 6 meters above ground level, very unique. BB\'s jazz club worth popping into.\r\nHad a great time and did loads of shopping as well as sightseeing, if I were staying in New York, would definitely consider New Yorker again.'
3,'Form over function, a pretty dismal experience...','This hotel rates highly on the wow factor when you first arrive. Now this could go one of two ways depending on your frame of mind... We came off a late flight from London and hit the lobby right at the peak of it\'s \'nightclub\' vibe. This is all well and good if you are there to party but I could not physically hear the reception staff and spent the entire conversation miming to them. Despite this, reception were friendly and helpful.\r\nThe rooms are pretty shocking. Having stayed at many other Schrager hotels (Mondrian/ Shore Club etc) I knew it would be pretty impractical but this was ridiculous. Here are my gripes:\r\n-hanging space is 0.5 metres wide with 5 hangers\r\n-no drawers to put clothes away (you end up stacking clothes everywhere which slightly defeats the point of having a \'design\' style room)\r\n-no slippers\r\n-no dressing gown\r\n-room so small I couldn\'t get around the TV to get into bed (I am not obese! and we were staying in a suite)\r\n-no overhead lighting - thank God it was Halloween to help explain my mismatching clothes and make up.\r\n-bathrooms remind you or an out of date nursing home\r\n-bath so small you couldn\'t drown a hamster in it\r\n-no fridge although they are snack areas on each floor which sounds great until you realise they are just big vending machines which isn\'t stylish or welcoming\r\n- staff were rude in the bar and I thought one sullen girl was actually going to start a fight with me when I asked for another drink. Charmless and bolchy.\r\nThe whole lobby scene is just a bit naff and the furniture/ whole Schrager look is so over done it really feels about 10 years too late. Hotel definitely needs a refurb. If I see one more ghost chair in a hotel lobby...\r\nOn the plus side:\r\n- breakast was lovely. Efficient and friendly service\r\n- fabulous location just behind Colombus Circus, near the park and near to good shops\r\n- room service was yummy (although each item comes with a $5 charge but 18\% service on top!!!)\r\nAs a finale, some \'hilarious\' joker decided to set off the fire alarm in the hotel bar somewhere so we spent the hours of 1-3am listening to announcements in the hallways telling us to evacuate/ not evacuate which was slightly disconcerting to say the least. I know it wasn\'t the hotels fault but it kind of sums up the vibe of the hotel: nightclubs are great but you just don\'t really need to sleep at one..'
4,'A Great Stay At A Great Hotel','We picked this hotel due to it\'s location,we wanted to be as close to Madison Square Gardens, as was possible. This place is directly opposite MSG, where we would be spending a lot of our time watching the New York Rangers, & New York Knicks.\r\nWe booked our trip through Virgin Holidays, for a 7 night stay - it was part of my wifes 40th Birthday celebrations. We didn\'t expect anything - but Virgin had made a note, & informed the hotel. When we checked in, the girl behind the check-in desk mentioned it \'\'Ooohhh I see it\'s a special occasion for you - let me see if I can sort something out for you\'\'. After a few minutes she had upgraded us from a basic room - to a suite (Which was massive!) on the top floor. The room had 2 big bathrooms, bedroom had a walk in wardrobe & 2 Kingsize beds, a lounge, & a kitchen area. It was perfect & really helped make our stay in NYC a truly memorable one. The staff were ALL supremely helpful & pleasant. This is my 1st choice hotel for my next trip to NYC.\r\nIF you had to be critical - the hotel is spotless - but parts of it look a tiny bit tired, & need updating - but there certainly isn\'t anything big enough to spoil your stay. \r\nA great hotel that has truly left us with many, many GREAT memories'
4,'Edison is my New York home.','Whenever I travel to New York, several times a year, I choose the Edison. It is conveniently located in the Theatre District, moderately priced, and professionally staffed. No matter when I visit, the Edison staff finds a way to accommodate my needs, whether for a small room or a suite, even though the hotel is always very busy. \r\nI enjoy the retro furnishings and the beautiful art deco lobby. I enjoy eating at the Edison Cafe and Sofias, both of which accommodate special dietary requirements. The price is right, although I have to admit that, since I discovered the Edison about 10 years ago, I have never looked to stay anywhere else and, therefore, have not compared prices.\r\nWhenever I visit, I recognize staff members, and they recognize me. Housekeepers are professional and willing to adjust to my schedule. I appreciate the availability of the Business Center. When flights are cancelled, I know the staff will work with me. I am glad to see someone at the security desk.'
3,'Good for Free!','We stayed here on points. As many have pointed out, you don\'t get the usual amenities from Starwood. That begs the question, why all the hype about being Gold/Platnum, if the service is not universal. How much does it cost to provide a bottle of water to your most valuable guests? Why don\'t I have a paper delivered to my door, as I do at 99\% of all Starwoods? Oh yeah, and no club either.I would not pay the high price to stay here, and be treated like someone off the street.\r\nOn to our stay. Check in was pleasant and smooth. We were given a nice room high up away from the noise.We had some issues on getting extra coffee,turndown service, and towels, but overall a good stay. great location for plays and shows, which was why we were there.\r\nTimes Square is a tourist trap so pass thru quickly! Last, we orderd a limo for the trip to LGA, and it was the same as a dumpy taxi. Nice and clean, smooth ride. We used Carmel. $33, plus toll and tip.'
4,'Feel right at home at the Affinia Manhattan','This is our second stay in this well-located hotel, right across from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. We love the home-like feel, the convenience of the kitchen, and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The beds are so perfectly comfortable and the room is so spacious! This place is a great value!\r\nThe only downside is that the window treatments are a bit dirty and need cleaning. Likewise the carpet could use a shampoo. But overall, a fabulous and happy stay!'
2,'Great Location, not great hotel','I stayed at Hotel Penn and the location is great! You are across from madison square garden and extremely close to subway access. From the outside the hotel looks nice and fun. The lobby is rather large and nice as well. As soon as you leave the main floor, the true colors of the hotel come out. The floors look like a scene from a haunted movie and this hotel really does need to be renovated. The rooms are tiny and the beds are small as well. The floor is dirty and the bathroom is old and can use a remodel. At night time you can hear the sounds of rats and mice in the walls and my friend and i had a hard time sleeping a few of the nights. I definitely recommend staying somewhere else for the price as we then switched hotels eventually to somewhere in lower manhattan and had a WAY better room that was updated.'
2,'Gute Lage, aber sehr schlechter und unfreundlicher Service','Die Lage ist super, gleich mit Subway Station um die Ecke und zentrale Lage zum Times Square, Empire State Building und etwaige Sehenswürdigkeiten.\r\nDas Zimmer war sehr klein und das Bad noch viel winziger. Verdreckte Fliesen, Abfluss während des gesamten Aufenthalts verstopft und das Personal hat es in den 4 Tagen nicht einmal geschafft Shampoo und Duschgel für zwei Personen aufzufüllen.\r\nDie Betten waren super, geschlafen hätte man auch gut, wenn die Wände nicht so dünn wären dass man die Nachbarn im Badezimmer hört und die Klimaanlage funktionieren würde.\r\nCheck in und out waren sehr schnell und reibungslos, wobei das Personal generell sehr unfreundlich ist. Warum es allerdings einen Concierge gibt ist mir rätselhaft, denn Stadtpläne hatte er nicht, Tour wusste er nicht und Musicaltickets wollte man uns auch nicht buchen. Das bezog sich nicht auf einen bestimmten Concierge, sondern auf alle 3 die rund um die Schicht Dienst hatten.\r\nFür den Preis den wir gezahlt hatten war das ein rundum enttäuschender Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel, vielleicht hatten sie es auch zur Weihnachtszeit nicht nötig...'
5,'Fantastic as always!','Just got back from a weekend at the Palmer House. Once again, from Rasha and the rest of the crew at the Front Desk, to Ernest up at the Executive Lounge, our time was superb. Kudos to the Palmer House as they consistently exceed our expectations. We have been going about 6 times a year for the last 8 years and have always had a wonderful time. Clean rooms, great food, fantastic service and a great location. In my book, can\'t be beat!'
4,'Heart of the city without emptying your wallet!','We stayed at the Edison at the end of July 2011, we were 4 girls sharing a room. I have been to New York a few times and brought 3 newbies to the city! \r\nOur first worry was bedbugs as we are aware they are a problem in the city, we went through the room with a fine tooth comb and all was clean. Mattress had a plastic cover which I am guessing was protection against these pesky creatures. \r\nAlthough the room, especially the bathroom could of benefited from some renovations (shower walls a little damaged, some cracks and nicks, nothing major) it was clean and great for the price. The room was not huge but, we were fine even with 4 girls in one room. There was one closet, a TV bureau and a table & chair, the basis. If you are looking for storage for your clothes, this might be minimal though. \r\nThe wi-fi connection comes at a high fee, but if you walk 20 seconds outside Times Square offers free wi-fi (which we sometimes caught from inside the room)\r\nAs many said, the location cannot be beat! In the heart of Times Square close to everything! Although, if your looking for a quiet neighborhood, this might not be it. We didn’t hear anything any noise from inside the room, but we went to bed for 4 am. \r\nEverything was functional, AC, lights, water. The shower also, but the shower head didn’t offer much of a stream (or am I too used to my giant shower head at home?)\r\nWe did not have much contact with the hotel staff, but they were courteous every time. We ordered extra pillows and blankets and got them right away, got access to the lobby phone pretty easy and got all the information we asked. Security at all times on the elevators, if you don’t have a room key you don’t go up! (Which is good but caused some mishaps for us think about this : 4girls – 2keys!)\r\nIn short, If your looking for a luxurious rest in a room with multiple conveniences and appliances – skip this choice. If you’re looking for a good clean hotel room to sleep while you cruise around New York, this is the place.'
4,'Wonderful hotel but DAMN elevators!','Take a wonderful location (ON Times Square...not near, ON!) a great city, a super staff and lovely building, and aside from slow internet and elevators you programme this is THE place. Would we stay again? For sure! Would I engineer the elevators differently? Same reply LOL!\r\nStaying here was a compromise as I usually do either suburban hotels or boutique ones downtown, but my partner and I were meeting my sister and her family with kids for a day in NY and then we all took a cruise from NYC so we needed something affordable, in the middle of it all and this at $149 a room (we needed three) on Priceline did the trick!\r\nRooms were HUGE by NYC standards, well-equipped and the views were the kind only New York can provide. Of course parking at $50+ a night is high but the valet service was uber efficient, and the staff all were friendly and nice.\r\nOnly two downsides ---\r\nOne was the weird elevators. We live on the 14th floor of a condo so we are USED to elevators for all trips but with these, you pick a floor on a pad by the elevator lobby entrance and it tells you which elevator (A thru I think N) you then get to take. There are NO Buttons in the elevators themselves, so if you choose the wrong one or don\'t pay attention and get on G when it said C you have to return to 1 and start again! Efficient for a huge hotel, maybe but still weird even for an elevator veteran!\r\nAnd the second my oft-mentioned issue with hotels: they have slow internet. Even (with the taxes and all) at almost $20 a day it was less than half the speed we get at home, and sputtered and started and stopped a few times on our iPad. We do wish less attention was paid to fancy TVs (they have flat screens) and cable and more to internet speeds in these days and times, especially when we feel it should be free (included is the right word as nothing is really free!) and not a high-priced add-on. Maybe hotels haven\'t figured this out yet but these days guests (business and leisure) all want faster internet for their iPads and laptops and games, and really watch less and less TV so it\'s time to scale cable back to the basics on cable and spend more cash on the net infrastructure --- at least we and many friends who travel think so!\r\nWould we go back? For sure. Did we like the hotel? No, we LOVED it!'
1,'Horrible experience','We stayed at the New Yorker because it was walking distance from Jacob Javits. I won\'t make that mistake again. I had to wait in line for at least fifteen minutes just to be brusquely checked in. The place is drab and dreary, overall. When I got to my tiny room, with a bathroom that had no place to even put a toothbrush and black hairs in the tub (not kidding!), I realized that the temp was freezing and that the heater was broken. It took three telephone calls just to get someone to show up! On my first day in NYC, I found myself waiting in a freezing room for two hours for the heater to be fixed. Fed up with waiting, I was shown two dark, grim rooms as possible replacements and decided to stay put (at least the room had three windows). I thought the heater was fixed, but to my surprise, the next night, it was still broken. At midnight, after another unsuccessful ordeal with their engineers in the room with ladders and drills, my companion and I found ourselves traipsing through the hotel in our pajamas while they finally relocated us to an acceptable room. I understand that hotels have maintenance issues. But I didn\'t expect the poor attitude and slow response to fixing the heater. When I called to let the customer service manager know of my disappointment, she adopted a nasty attitude. Overall, the place is just the pits. Grungy. When we left, the bellman insisted on escorting us over to a taxi, who was sitting in plain sight. He demanded a tip from the taxi driver, presumably for getting him a fare. And then he did not even help us get our bags into the taxi. Overall, the place is just smarmy.'
1,'Lamentable / Pathetic','Certainement une de mes plus mauvaise experience hoteliere. Il faut aller dans cet hotel seulement, mais seulement, si vous aimez etre coince comme une sardine. Si vous aimez etre regarde de haut en bas avec un air condescendant par le personnel de l\'hotel... Seulement si vous aimez, apres une journee bien rempli, etre assailli par le niveau sonore (digne des boites de nouit d\'Ibizza) de la musique du bar sans meme pouvoir siroter un verre dans un endroit un peu calme (non, non..) et surtout pas dans votre chambre qui ressemble a une cellulle de prison. Et bien sur au moment de vous endormir, vous realisez que le lit est a la mesure de la chambre, c\'est a dire trop petit, et les couvertures ou pseudo couettes le sont egalement... Bref, en un mot, pour le prix que l\'on paye, c\'est NUL. Il vaut mieux en choisir un autre.'
5,'Strategische Toplage für Kurztrips','Das Hotel ist in allen Belangen o.k. bis auf das sich das Empfangspersonal mit uns darüber eing war, daß die durchaus schicke Lobby zu dunkel gehalten ist. Tom, der filmreife Concierge, weiß alles und ist offenbar durch keine Frage zu erschüttern. Von hier aus kommt man ziemlich schnell überall hin- um die Stadt kennen zu lernen perfekt.'
3,'Muy buen situado pero mala insonorización de la habitacion','El servicio del hotel en general bastante bueno, habia personal en recepcion que hablaba en Español por si lo necesitamos. Las habitaciones limpias, con camas grandes y con una minicocina que nos víno muy bien para los desayunos, el baño es pequeño pero estaba todo en buenas condiciones. Lo peor nos toco un 5º piso en el que se oia todo hasta los ruido de la calle y encima al lado hay una comisaria y un cuartel de bomberos por lo que hubo una noche que no pegamos ni ojo. \r\nLo que mas me gusto la situacion y lo peor la mala insonorización de la habitación.'
5,'Loved the Southgate','My son and I recently spent 7 nights at the Southgate Tower hotel. I booked directly on the Affinia website and got a very good deal. I requested a non-smoking room with two beds on a high-floor, not facing 7th Avenue. That\'s exactly what we got. Our studio suite - 1922 - was perfect for us. It was very spacious with three large windows in the main room, from which we could see the beautiful illuminated Empire State Building and the Chrysler building beyond. The kitchen was spotless and fully-equipped. The bathroom was tiny, but served its purpose. \r\nEvery member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The chambermaids do a fabulous, thorough job. Lastly, there are several elevators and at any time, day or night, we never waited long before one became available.\r\nSome people question the location of this hotel, but for us, it was perfect. From this base on 31st Street we walked many miles in Manhattan. I hope, after its refurbishment, I can still afford to stay here on return visits to NYC!'
4,'Nettes Hotel direkt am Central Park','LageDas Hudson Hotel liegt im Zentrum von New York in Manhattan. Times Square und Broadway sind etwa 400 Meter entfernt. Geschäfte und Restaurants sind nach 100 Metern erreichbar. Zur nächsten U-Bahn-Station sind es 300 Meter. \r\nKleines aber sauberes Zimmer. Größe des Zimmers für NY aber vollkommen ok! \r\nLage ist super geeignet für eine Städtetour. \r\nPersonal super freundlich und hilfsbereit.\r\nHaben uns sehr wohl, sicher und willkommen gefühlt.\r\nFrühstück hatten wir nicht dazu gebucht. Starbucks ist gleich in der Nähe.\r\nEin Club ist im Hotel ist ganz nett. Musik hört man aber nicht im Zimmer.'
5,'An amazing hotel in the heart of Times Square.','Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Crowne Plaza and was thourghly satisfied and impressed with all areas of the Hotel You could not ask for a more central location for this Hotel. Our room comprised of two of the most comfy double beds (which are needed after a tiring day out in NY city) on the 17th floor overlooking Times Square. We were 2 rooms away from the lift and only heard it just before going to sleep and upon waking in the morning. Definately not loud enough to keep you awake at night. Others on this site have complained of the bathroom, though I fail to understand why! It comprises of a bath/shower a large vanity unit with wash basin and toilet. What more do you need? In addition to this toiletries including wash gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion are replaced daily. Yes there may have been a few minor chips in the bath ennamel but this was no big deal.I If this is your 1st time to New York plan your trip in advance as there is so much to see and do including loads of shopping. Woodbury Commons is the best place to find the bargains. (Get the bus from Port Authority Bus Terminal). Reccomendations for your trip include Rockerfella Centre, \'Top of the Rock\' by night. Empire State Building by day, Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero and Central Park.'
4,'Loved the Hudson - would definitely return.','Booked the Hudson with Priceline for $115 for four nights over Labour Day weekend. After the quite poor reviews I read, I was a little worried. But for $115 I figured I couldn\'t go wrong. I wasn\'t disappointed.\r\nGreat location. Close to two metro stops. Two minutes from Central Park.\r\nSome reviews mention a smell - - never experienced that. \r\nLobby and common rooms quite impressive. \r\nYes, room size is definitely small. But we had no problem hanging some clothing up, storing two carry-ons and one large suitcase in the room. TV is small but has lots of channels. \r\nWas never bothered by the noisy air conditioner, the air worked very well and easily adjustable. The room was VERY CLEAN and housekeeping was done everyday, fresh towels etc. Bathroom was clean and yes, compact, but again, was not an issue.\r\nWasn\'t really able to make good use of the facilities (roof top patio, library, bar etc.) but they looked great and the garden courtyard was a very nice spot to relax. \r\nDidn\'t have to deal with the staff too much but when we did they were polite and helpful. \r\nThe hotel had a variety of clientele but mostly in their 20\'s/30\'s. It has a very hip and trendy feel.\r\nAnd if I am fortunate enough to get the Hudson for $115 through Priceline again I would be THRILLED!!!! Would definitely return.'
4,'Awesome Hotel!','Fantastic Hotel! My wife and I went there for our anniversary and this is a superb hotel. Yes the rooms are a little dated but with the age of the hotel we felt like it added to the ambiance (they are renovating them from time to time). The staff is very gracious and accommodating, the location is great and we had an overall fantastic experience. We will definitely go back as time permits! ..Hint….join the HHonors program. Hands down best Honors program for hotels and depending on your level it has a good amount of perks at this hotel.'
5,'HOTELS the bombbb','omg the marriot hotel dont even ask me how was it ! its like A W E S O M E omg madddddddddddddd fun <33 ., mad foooooooood ( imfat ) .lol Juszt qo its On Broadway any questions aim me Woah bbe x'
5,'A Great Hotel','My sister and I enjoyed a girls weekend at the Marquis and the hotel was wonderful. It was in walking distance of all the Times Square action, convienent places to eat or you could easily grab a cab. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was well maintained and even though you are in the middle of Times Square you don\'t hear as much noise as you would think. I slept like a baby ! The beds were plush and the pillows were divine. I loved the pillows so much I plan to order the same ones the hotel uses.\r\nI can\'t say enough good things about the hotel. Yes, it is pricey but you do indeed get what you pay for. I would definitley stay there again !'
4,'Affinia Manhatten','Great location, easy access to subway and walking distance to Macy\'s, Times Square and much more. Very noisy from the street but that\'s New York. Concierge very helpful - hotel restaurant has excellent food'
4,'Mixed Feelings','I have mixed feelings about Park Central. I tend to gravitate toward the not most expensive places but places that are well located at a reasonable price, as I use hotels in large cities to sleep and take a shower. The pros are the price, the proximity of the 57th St/ 7th Ave metro station, Central Park ( 3 short blocks), 5th Ave (2 blocks), Carnegie Hall (across the street), Times Square (8 blocks) numerous good restaurants, and the price is far less than everywhere else. Our bed was comfortable. Luggage storage is available for 3.75 a bag which is convenient, the breakfast package was worth it and had a very good variety. The cons were the age of the hotel,as it could use some sprucing up, lack of air conditioning and room stuffiness, and don\'t expect any amenities such as room refrigerator, and expect to pay to get a wine glass in your room, and the coffee maker is not an automatic. Overall I\'d say it was a bargain for NYC, and the price and location are why I rate it as 4/5'
3,'Not to beat a small, dead horse but..........','When I entered my room I honestly thought I was being pranked. I\'d never been in a hotel room so...........cozy? The bathroom was equally interesting. I had to slide between the toilet and the wall directly infront of it to get to the shower. The cavernous lobby and public areas really give no indication of the size of these rooms.\r\nCramped quarters aside, the location was pretty convenient for what I needed to do & see. The staff were quite helpful as well. The valets who stored & retrieved our bags were the best. The staff & location really redeem this hotel (which is why I couldn\'t bring myself to give the property the rating it warrants). The rooms don\'t do it any favors....'
4,'Good hotel','Stayed for a week in August with my husband for our wedding anniversary. \r\nHotel - Hotel bedrooms have undergone renovation and are very clean and updated. We stayed on the 29th floor, in a corner room, which compared to reviews of other rooms, seems to have more space as we did not find it small at all. (Maybe worth asking for a corner room when you book - also means you get 2 sides of windows/views). View of river was good. Maid cleaned the room and replaced towels daily - room was always very clean. No coffee/tea facilities in room - however 10 mins after we checked in reception called to ask if we would like a coffee machine delivered to the room free of charge - which we got another 10 mins later! They gave us a couple of packets of coffee/milks which lasted a couple of days. We found the staff fairly friendly and helpful. Hotel does not have that many facilities but then you would not use much when staying in New York!\r\nEating - Tick Tock diner is next door which is ok, there is another cafe/restaurant when you come out of the hotel and turn right, straight across the road (next to Irish place). Of course, there are tons of cafes/Starbucks etc around anyway. The restaurant next to the hotel did very good food and fairly reasonably priced. The Irish place also does nice food. We did not find many other great restaurants around the area - think you would have to know where to go and probably out of this area to get a really good meal. \r\nTravel - subway is right next door to hotel. Can walk to a lot of things from hotel - including Grand Central Station which is about 25 mins walk away past Bryant Park. Penn station is across the road also. Would recommend using the subway which is $2 a journey rather than being ripped off by yellow cabs! You can also get discounts on buying lots of tickets on the subway. \r\nAttractions - as mentioned, a lot is nearby. Would recommend Top of the Rock (Rockefeller building) rather than Empire State as queues much shorter and view just as good. Broadway is up the road - can book tickets on ticketmaster or we just went to the theatre and bought them direct and chose our seats. WE used Gray Line bus company and bught a 3 day bus tour ticket where you can hop on/off the various tours they do. The price included a boat cruise which was good. Would recommend going out of the immediate area to see things e.g. Central Park, South Street Seaport etc etc. \r\nOverall - a good experience at this hotel and would stay again.'
1,'Filthy chamber of horrors!!','Rude staff some of which can barely speak English. Never ever have I experienced anything near this atrocious level of service. Waited nearly 3 hours to check in on Sunday night. Just two very slow agents on duty?? Room was dirty and smelly. Probably no maintenance for many years. Hallways were like ovens with dirty worn carpets, old faded paint everywhere. If you have a car they will charge you $50.00 a night!! They carefully never disclose this on their internet site, wonder why, as most decent Hotels do. Avoid at all costs – total disgrace.'
5,'Loved it!','Great place to stay if you have a couple (bunch) of kids. Kitchenette was great to store juice/milk etc. Beds were the most comfortable of any hotel I\'ve ever stayed in. Room had great closets; two bathrooms, pull-out coach and two beds (although one was a twin). More like a mini-apartment than a hotel room. Directly across the street from Penn Station...very easy to grab a taxi in the morning to get over to American Girl Store. Walked to Toys-R-Us and theater. Will definitly stay here again.'
4,'Convenient & Comfortable!','Booked through Expedia, was a decent price for the location, not the cheapest but certainly not the most expensive, looked at similar hotels in the area but booked this hotel on the basis of comments made by other guests. The location is great especially if it is your 1st time in NYC, a short walk from Penn Station so easy from Newark Airport. Hotel is located south of Mid Manhattan just across from Madison Square Garden and only a short distance from Macy\'s, everything touristy is within walking distance (empire state, Times square, Central Park etc) and you can get the Subway to lower Manhattan really easily. Hotel was fine, room was bigger than expected and the bed was really comfortable, hotel is staring to show some sign of age but was kept really clean. The hotel overall was better than we had expected. Would recommend for 1st timers to NYC.'
5,'Wonderful week in NY at the Affinia Manhattan','We had enjoyable stay at the Affina Manhattan, we had a studio suite with very spacious bathroom, it was ideal, as our Daugher\'s wedding was on, and we had lots of room for the occasion. The location was also ideal, very close to Penn Station, Macey\'s and the Empire State Building. The staff were very friendly and the bar and diningroom were fab, very modern. It was a little noisy at night, but we were in the centre of NY, the city that never sleeps. We had air conditioning in the room and comfortable beds.'
4,'ottimo holel per chi viaggia con i figli','Hotel in posizione più che ideale a Manhattan, pulito, accogliente, camere spaziose dotate di angolo cottura. Alcune sere, considerata la stanchezza dei bambini, abbiamo preso il take away e mangiato in stanza! \r\nUnico neo i due letti matrimoniali erano un po\' più piccoli dello standard!\r\nSotto l\'hotel ci sono moltissimi locali dove si può fare colazione quindi non consiglio di prendere la colazione in Hotel'
1,'Decepcion total','En los ultimos años nos hemos alojado en hoteles Hyatt de varios paises y la verdad es que todos fueron excepcionales. \r\nPero el de New York nos ha decepcionado muchisimo ya que no es un 5* Lujo ni por asomo. Lo seria hace años, pero hoy en dia no se merece esa categoria. \r\nEl lobby si que es muy bonito y bastante grande, ademas, yo fui en navidades y lo tenian con decoracion navideña y muy bonito. \r\nPero las habitaciones dejaban mucho que desear. La mia en concreto no tenia humedades, pero si que estaba obsoleta, y el baño ya ni os cuento. Ademas de pequeño estaba antiquisimo y la cortina de la ducha llena de manchas oscuras como de humedad o moho o vete tu a saber......\r\nEn conclusion, que con la pasta que nos cobraron (prefiero no acordarme de lo que pague cada noche) para mi fue decepcionante, vamos, que si vuelvo a Nueva York, tengo claro a que hotel NO voy a ir. Lo que mas rabia me da es que lo vendan (y por supuesto lo cobren) como un 5* Lujo cuando en realidad, si nos centramos en las habitaciones, se queda en un 4* cortito.\r\nLo unico bueno es la situacion ya que a pocos pasos estas en Times Square, pero por lo demas....... PESIMO'
5,'You will be very happy at the Westin','The Westin is a great hotel. It is clean, modern, and the staff is great. By modern, I mean plentiful, quick elevators, good water pressure in the shower, modern bathroom, comfortable beds. No old creaky elevators, no saggy mattresses, no showers that dribble out and constantly change temperatures---thank God!\r\nYes, modern is definitely better than boutique, to me!\r\nWe were on the 38th floor with a great waterview and we were able to open the window slightly for a little fresh air!\r\nAnother nice feature was a safe in the room. The i-pod docking unit was great also!\r\nThe only negatives were the lack of free internet service. I went to the conceirge and they were able to give me the info I wanted. Also, parking was around $45-50/night......though most hotels charge similar rates.\r\nYou can\'t go wrong here. I don\'t look for nor expect slippers, coffee mugs, etc., in my rooms, so I was not the least bit disappointed! I look at the big picture....nice bed, elevators, and bathroom! The Westin met our every need!'
2,'WORST HOTEL EVER','My first time in New York as a Graduation present, took 1 hour to check in. Lines were long. Got to the room and it felt like a horror movie set. Worst of all was the HORRIBLE BATHROOM. The tub was rusty the sink was falling off the Pedestal. I couldn\'t believe it. Never staying here again.'
5,'Excellent experience at the Marriott Marquis','I loved this hotel!\r\nIt was modern, slick and everything worked.\r\nI loved the lift system (once I\'d had it explained to me by my know-it-all son).\r\nOur room was fab - really spacious. I\'d been ill and just wanted to sleep the whole visit - I didn\'t achieve that but I would have been happy to do so in that room. We overlooked Times Square and although it wasn\'t a great view (surrounded by other buildings) I still felt part of the goings-on.\r\nThe staff were amazing!\r\nFront desk staff: we\'d had a nightmare experience at JFK and I arrived at the Marriott in a foul mood - they got me out of it pretty quickly just by their sheer understanding and niceness - full marks!\r\nConcierges: really polite even when I\'d asked the same question four times.\r\nSecurity staff: I\'d mistaken him for the concierge (in my defence it was midnight, I was ill, half asleep and he was at the Concierge desk) but he went out of his way to help me and then - in New York! - refused to accept a tip.\r\nI\'ve given it an excellent for value as we got a really good price. I think the rack rate is a little expensive but even then would deserve a very good.\r\nThe location couldn\'t be better.\r\nI will be back!'
5,'Lovely experience','We booked this hotel through Travelzoo, getting a great deal on a suite. I requested as high up as possible and was given a room on the top 40th floor with great river and city views. The room had fridge with water and cokes and drinks machine for tea/coffee making, extras availble via the maid service. The room and sitting room were warm, clean, pleasently furnished and comfortable, a real sanctuary for the hustle and bustle of the city. The staff in the hotel, diner and bar were friendly, polite and helpful, throughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend booking.'
5,'awesome place.... we\'ll back agian','Stayed for a Family Trip during Memorial Weekend. stayed in a king room with Sofa. big size room.\r\nThe hotel is huge and a bit disorientating at first with reception on the 8th floor but the staff were friendly and helpful and check in really efficient for such a massive place.\r\nThe best best best thing about this hotel is its location-location is relay awesome.'
5,'Affinias are great','We try to stay at an Affinia when we go into the city. They never disappoint. Affinia Manhattan is larger than the others, with a very grand lobby. A few of the others are a little cozier. I never feel these rooms are anything but immaculate and the amenities great.Our 2 bathrooms were very modern. Staff very friendly. Loved that I had to show my room key-card to get into the elevator after a certain hour. I had a beer in the bar off the lobby and the Irish bartender was friendly and helpful about helping us find a location. Chelsea is within walking distance.'
2,'Shabby Stay at Park Central Hotel, NYC','As soon as we walked into the lobby we knew this place was bordering on being a dive. Long check in line and very mixed bag of people. Front desk looked like it was a \'front\' with horrible long black curtains masking something in the background. Upon getting into elevator could not push button for floor. Others in the elevator explained that you have to push the floor button outside of the elevator to access floor. No one at the front desk bothered to tell us that. In addition for such a large hotel it did not have enough elevators for the many people. We had to wait for the two elevatosr to return to the lobby 3 times before we could board it.\r\nRoom had no radio/clock (which should be a basic feature), no coffee maker (should also be a basic feature), and faced a dark courtyard (so you couldn\'t really tell what time of day it was). Mattresses were lopsided, pillows were lumpy and sheets were bordering on coarse. On our 2nd day (which was also thank goodness our last day) there was one towel, one hand towel and one washcloth for two people in a room with two beds. Guess housekeeping can\'t count as it was obvious two people had slept in the two beds. Guess I expect too much common sense. The carpets in the room and hallways were filthy and didn\'t appear to be vacuumed too often. The walls are paper thin and we could hear every door slamming in the hall way and loud voices projecting through the walls. As well we could hear the tv next door through the walls. The water pressure on the 5th floor was weak. The bathroom is so poorly designed that you can not fully open the door as it hits the toilet! Finally the room was very overheated. We tried regulating the dials inside the radiator turning one to the coolest setting and the other to fan and received hot blowing air. My husband who is usually cool or comfortable turned off the regulating dials as he got nauseated from the uncontrollable heat. We tried opening the \'key locked\' window in the room to no avail.\r\nWe frequent NYC regularly and this was a spur of the moment reservation made because of the location. After all this is NYC how could a hotel offer such low standards and still be in existence? We won\'t assume anything in the future and let down our guards.\r\nSpend the extra money and stay somewhere else that at least offers clean rooms, basics such as a clock radio and coffee maker, and boasts of comfortable beds and pillows. We were never so happy to get out of there on the morning of our departure at 6 am and make ourselves more comfortable at the La Guardia terminal which is not great, but at least it\'s cleaner than the hotel. Flying home on a small plane I was able to take a nap which provided some decent sleep which I was not able to get in the hotel.\r\nIt\'s hard to believe that people posted positive reviews of this hotel received as it does not warrant a rating higher than poor.'
1,'The worst hotel ever','This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. This building is supposed to be destroyed to be replaced by a sky-scapper, and the hotel is clearly not making any efforts to keep this hotel in a decent shape.'
5,'Great Location, and very comfortable rooms','We stayed here for 3 nights, and upon check in we were upgraded as this was for a special birthday. The room was really well furnished and the air conditioning heavenly. The bathroom had plenty of room and was very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and being on the 24th floor there was no outside noise. The tea/coffee facilities was minimal, although the few Starbucks coffee pods were excellent. With four of us in a room, 2 adults and two teenagers, it did not feel cramped at all, and we would definitely stay here again. It was no more than 5 minutes walk to The Hard Rock Cafe in Times Sq! After getting back from a long day out and not wanting to go out again for food, as we had been given 90dollars room credit, (this may have been booking through Virgin) we decided to order from room service. Although the prices are higher than if we had gone out, the food was hot, a good portion size and extremely tasty, worth the extra money. Upon leaving the concierge could not have been more helpful, booking a cab (as there were 6 in our party) the price he obtained was cheaper than getting 2 yellow cabs to JFK. We left our bags and went off for the day, and getting back 45 minutes earlier than we had said, the concierge noticed this and phoned for our cab to come sooner. We will definitely stay here again!'
2,'Don\'t ignore the warnings','I thought, A hotel room is a hotel room. We just want a clean place to sleep while in New York, so I ignored what I read about the Hudson.\r\nIt turns out that I want more than the Hudson had to offer. I want to step out of the tub and dry off, not step onto the toilet. I want to see where I\'m going when I walk down the hall to my room. I want a tv that I can see from the bed. I want room to walk around the bed and a lock on the door that works. I want a bathroom without a picture window in the shower facing the bedroom. \r\nThe room was strange but clean, the staff was friendly, the lobby was attractive, but I want more. I want more for my money so I\'ll book my hotel more carefully next time. If you want more, too, then book your stay in New York elsewhere.'
5,'Everything was great would stay here again.','We stay for 2 nights Sept 23 & 24th, we were able to check into room early. Had a great view of the Hudson River from our room, size of room was just fine, room was clean and the bed as always at a westin was wonderful. Great location to everything.'
5,'First trip to New York','My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on December 19-23, 2011. We arrived at the hotel before 10:00am and was able to check in at this time. When we arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was that the room was small. The queen sized bed took up much of the room. The bathroom was even smaller. The bathroom door could not open all the way because the toilet was in the way. Since this was our first trip to NYC, we were not in our room much. Generally, we left in the morning and did not get back to our room until after dinner. The hotel is a very nice hotel. The concierge was great. Meg, was the person we dealt with and she is VERY knowledgeable about everything NYC. The doorman was always gracious and showed us how to summons a taxi. The room service people were never seen yet every time we came back to our room, everything was cleaned and straightened up. They say, whomever they are, the best way to tell if the hotel was good, is if the people who stayed at the hotel would so again. I would not hesitate to stay there again. It was a great experience.'
3,'Good location','The location of this hotel is excellent. Radio City Music Hall, within a few minutes walk - just sorry there were no concerts on when we were there! Central Park just minutes over the road.\r\nThe hotel itself was fine. Very busy with lots of conventions and business people. Check in was as you would expect from New York.\r\nThe room was quite small - there was a sofa situated at an angle, which was strange as it took up lots of room - probably best without that and just a chair instead. Bathroom looked new, but again very small.\r\nWe tried the restaurant for breakfast on the first morning - you learn by your mistakes - it was very expensive - and confusing! From then on, we tried a cafe to the left of the hotel - excellent breakfast and very reasonable.\r\nOverall, a nice hotel, but maybe a bit pricey.'
5,'Great Hotel, Great Location','Terrific hotel in the heart of NYC. Staff was friendly and helpful, room was spacious and very nice, well decorated, great view, can\'t say enough good things about our stay. We will definitely go back.'
4,'Great Location - Nice Big Rooms','We really liked the location and rooms for this hotel, and the rate was really hard to beat. The adjacent restaurant was highly forgetable for breakfast, including the service, though the bar looked nice for evening cocktails. Concierge was very helpful in helping us set an itinerary and bellmen and others were generally very friendly. The size of the rooms was the best. We stayed in a suite and had plenty of room. Bathroom was tiny but all the more reason not to spend too much time in there!'
5,'Beautiful Hotel with Great Location','My wife and three-year old daughter just stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for seven nights. We had a very nice sized room on the 20th floor. We bring an air mattress for my daughter and there was a decent amount of room for it. \r\nThe hotel is about two blocks from Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Millenium Park which is really nice. The Red Line of the El is also right outside the State Street exit. We did not have a car in Chicago so being in a central location was a key for us. I would recommend not bringing a car since the parking for the hotel is about a block away and it did not look convenient to park anywhere in the city.\r\nWe were very happy here and would definitely stay here again.'
1,'poor service and terrible customer care','I know that the service in the NY hotels is not the best.. but in this case...\r\nThe hotel staff was really unhelpful, because they didn\'t know how to handle with the clients\'needs!! for every single step they need to tallk to the mgr on duty\r\nhowever I spent there 3 days/2 nights . I did the reservation of my booking for the 1st night on the Hotel website and the second night on Trivago. At the check in I have informed about it the receptionist\r\nThe second day, returning back to the Hotel, I was really wet due to the pooring rain.. well I couldn\'t go into my room because it looked that I didn\'t left my credit card for the second night!! What?? I have already paid by credit card to the Hotel my first night.. so they had my details. It could be ok for meuntill in the conditions I was on line for more than 20 minutes at the front desk, full of people doing the check in ... but the final thing it was that the receptionist had to talk about my issue to the manager who was in charge to allow me to enter in the room. This last part took other 30 minutes-. So at the end for their mistake I stayed outside my room, waiting to get a shower for more than 2 hours ..........\r\nIt was a very nice evening !!'
4,'Excelent Location! Nice hotel','My wife and I were on NY and Canada this summer and NY was the first stop in our journey.\r\nBasically we selected this hotel because of its excelent location ( we were going for 2 broadway shows ) and because of the heavenly bed!! Generally we miss our bed when we are on vacation, but this hotel make us feel like we are at home.\r\nThe lobby and the building are not very impressive, but the rooms are very nice, modern design and very convenient, they got flat TV, Radio Clock with Ipod Dock, and of course the heavenly bed and the heavenly bath.\r\nThe location is awesome, we are just in the heart of Times Square, at 2 blocks from the Minskoff Theatre and one from the Majestic and from Breadway itself. At 4 blocks its the home base of the Grey Line Bus that do the NY Tour ( very recommendable, you can go by all NY!! hop on and off wherever you want ). In the same block its a very nice pizza restaurant ( Bella Vita Pizzeria ) and in the corner of the 43th and Broadway there is a nice Cafe to have breakfast ( Europa Cafe ). Try this hotel, its nice, convenient and very confortable!'
4,'Great location and clean rooms','The hotel has great location. Rooms are very clean and satisfying. Hallways need renovation, if you care the hallways:). \r\nI would recomend for anyone who doesnt want to spend fortune for hotel in Time Square, Manhattan.'
2,'I\'m sad to have to leave a bad review :(','Out of 7 reviews I have left in the last 10 months, this is my first negative one :( \r\nFirstly when checking in, (1st October) the reception staff were miserable, no one was smiling, and our lady barely spoke, she almost looked depressed and is clearly in the wrong job :( Not a good first impression. We are from the U.K and had been in Vegas for 5 days, were my boyfriend proposed :) so we were mega cheery and looking forward to the next leg of our trip in New York. We were in room 1632 and when we walked in I could have cried. It was very small, so old, and had a horrible musty smell. The carpet was all crumpled up, which caused a few trips from my fiance and I. The bed was brick hard, and it squeaked and groaned with any movement. The pillows had absolutely no feathers in them and were therefore so flat! The electicity sockets are a law suit waiting to happen. When charging phones or using my hair straightners, they made a \'sizzling\' sound, and sockets were hanging out the wall! Jeez! The shower curtain was so grotty and ripped, and one of the towels had blood stains on it?! My goodness!! Our keycard for entry to our room very rarely worked and it took us 10/15 trys to get in! (Using both our cards!) \r\nPositives? errrrrrrrrrr...... there is always security men in the lobby who don\'t let you use elevators unless you show your room keycard which is great. The bar attatched (Rum Bar) is lovely, always buzzing and we seen an elderly gentleman playing the piano which was fab. Sofi\'s italian at the back was very yum! Yeah it is a great location but so are alot of other hotels. This was my first trip to New York and I will look to pay a little extra in the future (although the Edison wasn\'t even that cheap!)'
1,sucks!,'we read all the review about this hotel and we were anxious about it but we dont have a choice all hotels are fully book. upon entering the looby its so dark and so busy the check in counter has a long line, while we are in the elevator were thingkin about our room hoping it will be ok........when my wife open the room i want to back out and check out our room so untidy the carpet its full of mud stain the washroom some tiles are missin lights full of dust with flies, the shower so slow its like the water is running out. the good thing in this hotel is the location is accessible to all.'
5,'Fantastic stay','How can you argue with a hotel that offers superb service (door, front desk, concierge, tickets/tours, housekeeping), is responsive to requests (a second robe delivered in less than 10 minutes), has terrific room amenities (BOSE radio, IMac computer, widescreen LCD TV), and has an Executive Club lounge that made good on its promise of continental breakfast and evening hors d\'oeuvres. Plus, the hotel was quiet (didn\'t hear a thing), had windows that open, and is in a terrific location in the Theatre District. Thank you to all the Tripadvisor reviewers who had a balanced view of this hotel - you made our decision to book the Westin easy!'
5,'Westin\'s always good.','I alsways say that Westin\'s are always good. They respect better standards than Sheraton\'s or others. The Westin in Times Square is not an exception. \r\nOnly small details to take in consideration:\r\n- Big hotel with many rooms, so rather crowded and packed with people (some people like this ambiance anyways).\r\n- Good location for a first visit to New York (just by Times Square and surronded by Broadway venues). However, Times Square is a tiring area: always full of people (Mumbai-like full, not your regular city full), everyday, at every hour of the day and night, always!\r\nSo, if this is not your first time in NYC then more charming neighborhoods should be preferred (more downtown than midtown).'
4,'Chic, tiny, centrally located','A friend and I stayed in the Hudson Hotel for two nights while she was in town for business. As a native, I had seen the public spaces in this hotel before, and they are gorgeous – from the ivy-draped lobby check-in area to the chic, floor-lit bar area to the fireplace lounge – very inviting on a cold winter night. We could also see the beautiful outdoor space through the lobby windows – though with temperatures in the 20s, it was a feature we didn’t actually see in person. The actual restaurant in the hotel is currently closed for renovation.\r\nThe staff, though beautiful and chic as the hotel, are warm, service oriented, polite and accommodating. Joe at the front desk helped us with check-in and gave us a room toward the top of the hotel with a lovely Hudson River view. Everyone we encountered, in fact, from the doormen to the bartender, was polite and helpful. Young, thin, fabulous people straight out of central casting wander the lobby and a few were draped over the leather chairs and sofas, asleep, early on a Monday morning. We stopped in the bar for a nightcap on the first night and got immediate sticker shock from the $15 price tag for top shelf drinks – not specialty drinks or anything, just top shelf liquor – and we are both city people who’ve been around the block a few times. They also offer a $28 breakfast buffet in the bar in the mornings (and complimentary coffee to go for hotel guests). It’s a space worth checking out – just be ready for the price.\r\nNow to the rooms. Let’s just say this is not a hotel for your ordinary, generously sized middle aged business person who needs to get some work done and relax in the room between meetings – or anyone with claustrophobia. Though they are well thought-out and designed, the rooms are tiny – and that’s generous. In our queen room, there was approximately 12-18 on either side of the bed, and about the same at the foot of the bed – that is it in terms of floor space in the main area. There\'s a small hallway to the bathroom with a closet and 3 small hooks on the wall, good for coats, etc. The bathroom is so small that anyone over about 5 9 would bang their knees on the wall when sitting on the toilet. There is a small desk, a small closet and a tall, thin cabinet that houses a safe (not large enough for a laptop), an older model stereo (I saw no iPod dock in the room though others have mentioned them), one drawer and 3 small shelves. It also looks like it once housed a tiny television. In an ingenious design move, the two walls on either side of the bed are mirrored to give a slightly more open feeling. On one wall, however, the mirror has a cutout that is retrofitted with a flat screen TV on an adjustable arm, which obscures part of the mirror and makes It awkward to walk beside the bed on that side. The platform bed is firm and comfortable – both of us slept pretty well. The bathroom has standard amenities-soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, all natural products, and three decent sized shelves for toiletries. For two friends sharing a room, the open shower was disconcerting – it has a window with a sheer curtain that faces into the room. It provides light and a more open feeling to the bathroom, but not much in the way of privacy. Also, our room had a shower in a tiny bathtub – but if you want a luxurious bath, this is not the place. There’s no coffee maker (you can get coffee downstairs easily, though), refrigerator or other amenities to keep you in the room. There is an iron and a tiny ironing board. \r\nIn short, this is a hotel for the young, thin and hip, who plan to spend days sightseeing and nights clubbing. The hotel’s location is ideal for both. It is not a hotel for families (kids would go stir crazy in the teeny rooms), or middle aged business people as I outlined above.'
2,'Old and musty hotel in need of major revamp but great location - a real disappointment when you open the room door!','Hotel has a great location but is in major need of a complete update and renovation. The Hotel smells old and musty and the rooms leave alot to be desired. The first room we were offered had graffiti on the walls - did the cleaners not see it!!! On complaining, we were told all the rooms were of a similar quality and you may get a better matress in another room!!!! the second room was a little better but still in poor decoative repair with wallpaper peeling and paintwork badly damaged. I know the website says it was built in the 1930\'s and retains much of it\'s original features but it doesn;t look like it has been decorated or improved since then either. The lifts are also very slow and you can wait at leat 10-15 minuts in the peak times to get to your floor. Good luck if you\'re on the 21st floor like we were. No room service either which was a disappointment as the Hotel would appear to missing this simple client need when relaxing on holiday. I would NOT recommend the Hotel to anyone and would not stay there again. The Wellington Hotel just around the corner is far better value for money and far better accommodation but with the same fabulous location being close to everything and offering room service and a typical American Diner attached.'
4,'Convenient Location','Recently stayed at the hotel for a conference. I had none of the problems that others have reported related to check-in - took me all of about 5 minutes, no line and desk clerk was very polite (I arrived around 7 p.m.). My room was on the 26th floor and was very quiet. Bed was extremely comfortable. Looks like the room had been recently renovated - new carpet, bedding, paint, wallpaper, etc. I would have to concur with the comments about the A/C - I had mine cranked down all the way on high and it really never got cold (but was not uncomfortably warm either - cool would be the best way to describe it). Because the hotel is very large, there are always a lot of people in the lobby, elevators, etc. Sometimes took a few minutes to get an elevator. Two bars in hotel (with ridiculous prices) and a cafe/restaurant which looked nice. Always easy to get a taxi at the front of the hotel. Subway nearby. Central Park a short walk away.\r\nBroadway two blocks over and 5th avenue one block the other way. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I were ever in NYC.'
5,'Excellent service in difficult circumstances','My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza during the week that Hurricane Sandy hit New York. It was a surprise 40th trip for myself and Caron Heller and her team made sure that we had a fabulous room with an amazing view, and complimentary snacks and wine upon arrival, which were most appreciated. We\r\nhad stayed at the hotel before so knew that the location really was second to none for visiting Times Square and setting high standards of cleanliness and comfort.\r\nFor me, where this hotel really hit the mark was in the excellent service that they continued to provide over the difficult days of Hurricane Sandy. Despite an obvious shortage of staff everyone was cheerful and professional, and the free drinks provided were an added bonus! Even the porters outside were excellent at flagging us a cab to the airport and securing a \'fair fare\' when gas was low and so was morale. \r\nI love this hotel, and would like to thank everyone there foe making my 40th birthday my best ever.'
4,'Busy, loud lobby, with great sleeping room','It had been awhile since I stayed here and I had forgot how busy the lobby and elevators can be at peak times. But there is a flow here and it works.\r\nSleeping room is very generous in size and was quiet. Air conditioning worked well. The tv did not work.'
4,'Convenient, clean, and the staff is top notch!','Fourth year staying at the Affinia, and they never disappoint! The staff is friendly and attentive, the new decor is gorgeous, and I plan to stay here in the future. Thanks for a great weekend, Affinia!'
3,Dissapointed,'Booked two nights at Westing Times Square in celebration of my 32nd Birthday, given that we did the same thing for my 30th Birthday and loved the place.\r\nThis time around it seems that Westin is cutting corners and it was just not the same, even though we had nice corner high floor room, the service has fellow bellow my expectations. I have called to room service asking them to make the bed and fresh towels I got nothing and by the time I realized that they never came I did not want to bother. I noticed that carts with food sitting long time in hallways before they get picked up again by room service people. The bathrobes are now seem to be on request.\r\nThe only good thing is location but other then that I might have stayed at cheaper hotel in the area. I doubt I will return to this particular Westing again and just stick to the Hilton on across the street.'
1,'Hated It','Bathroom tiles had mold. Furniture was threadbare. Sheets had holes. Towels were stained.'
5,'Best of the best!!','Great service, awesome room, beautifully appointed. Bathroom was that of a 5 star hotel.\r\nStaff was very attentive; bell-person Eric was GREAT-you can tell he loves his job and his guests.\r\nThis is a hotel I would highly recommend for business or pleasure. The only down fall was my visit was too short there.'
3,'Edison hotel 1995 - 2010','Ideaal gelegen hotel 47 th. str. tussen Broadway en 8e Avenue\r\nMeeste bezienswaardigheden kan U te voet doen... in nabijheid van enkele belangrijke metrostations, restaurants, shopping, enz...\r\n17 jaar reisleider bij BCD travel voorde marathon van New York, waaronder 15 x in Edison hotel.'
2,'Very shabby','Stayed here end of October 2011 - took a long time to check in - the original room we were given was tiny and dark - the bed was a small double and quite wobbly on its legs - the bathroom was not good at all, it didn\'t even have a toilet seat let alone a shower curtain! I returned to reception to ask for a rooom change and was asked to come back tomorrow after mid-day - although this was a major inconvenience in view of the fact that we had limited time in New York I decided that I would. After an even longer wait at reception I was finally given an upgrade to a much better room - it was larger and brighter with a large kingsize bed - however it was not particularly clean and very shabby decor wise to say the least. The entire hotel could do with major redecoration, particularly the bathrooms. Having said all that it is in a brilliant location.'
1,BAD,'I stayed December 26, 2011 to December 30, 2011 and was not impressed. When I first arrived, the doorman directed me to the hotel parking. When I went to park, a bald white guy in a suit said I could not park there. I showed him my itinerary and he still said I could not park in the hotel parking. I told him that that was unacceptable. He threatened to call the police and I told him to call the police. I drove my car closer to the hotel doors and waited until another employee assisted me. He said I could park in the hotel parking and took my car. He also sent the rude employee over to apologize to me. I was also not impressed with the condition of the hotel. My bathroom doorknob fell off in my hand and the water in the shower was always lukewarm. When I went down to the hotel bar, the waitress was incredibly slow. On another night, the same waitress directed me to a seat in the bar that had ice and liquid from a spilled drink on it. Lastly, no one was outgoing or helpful accept for Hector the doorman. I would NEVER stay at the hotel again.'
4,'Funky hotel with great NYC atmosphere','We stayed at the Hudson in NYC for 5 nights - we found it very funky, very fun with a youthful and high energy.\r\nThe rooms are positively tiny, though this is fine - how much time do you really spend it your room in New York? The see through bathroom\'s are a bit to get used to, but hey, there\'s a shower curtain which can block the view. \r\nOverall, a great hotel - very happy.'
2,'Hotel Pennslyvania, New York','We have just returned from our first trip to New York, three days was not long enough particularly with the long flight. I had used the travel advisor prior to going to look at the details of the Hotel Pennsiyvania, and they weren\'t too good. I had booked with tradewinds so I thought it was be a resonable Hotel.\r\nI have to say I agree with some of the reviews, as a base it was great and the staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were cleaned each day. If you were lucky you had a view of The Empire State Building but that was it. If you were expecting plush and luxiourius the Hotel Penn is not for you. Apparently Glen Miller wrote the song Pennslyvannia 6-5000 (the hotel\'s telephone number) afters staying here in the 1940\'s, by the decorative state of our room, I don\'t think it has actually been decorate since.\r\nThe rooms are very drab and sad and in total need of decoration, piant peeling of the walls and holes in the walls where pictures once hung. The bath although clean was chipped and stained and so were the tiles. However if you just want clean sheets and a clean room as a base then it was fairly cheap for the three days.\r\nI would definatley go back to New York as i didn\'t do or see half of what I wanted to do, the grey Line tour bus was great to get a feel of the city as was the night time tour. I loved Greenwich and Soho. Saving up already to go back. (but not to Hotel Pennslyvania.'
1,'Avoid this hotel','Though my room looked clean at first I discovered it was beyond dirty. My sheet had fresh blood smears and used towels hidden on the bottom rack. It\'s almost impossible to get managment\'s attention and when you do you wish you hadn\'t. The front door staff could use some customer service training but the bell and security staff were great. Not to mention the professionalism of the some of the front desk staff and Mr. Williams, who is the only person in mgmt that seems to care about the guests. As one of the hotel workers stated, I wouldn\'t stay here for anything. I suggest you take that advice.'
4,'Great location','Just a minute from Times Square. Lots of theatres very close to the Edison Hotel. Room was fine, not too big, but OK. Very very thin walls. I could actually hear the guy in the room next to mine snore! And I could hear his telephone conversations word for word. I don\'t understand Hebrew, but could easily make out it was Hebrew.\r\nThis is a very good, efficient hotel, nice, helpful staff. I liked the breakfast restaurant on the premises; not expensive; good food.'
3,'Sometimes size matters','Our first impression of the Hudson, upon arriving in their 3rd floor lobby, was, Well, this is...dark.. FYI, the lobby has perhaps the lowest level of lighting of any we\'ve experienced. It\'s quite unique, as you\'re in a huge ivied arbor. But it is dark!\r\nWe paid scant attention to some reviews critical of the size of the rooms. It turns out they were justified. For the record, our room at the Hudson was the smallest we have experienced anywhere. Numbers 2 through 5 would be Amsterdam, Barcelona, Paris and Hong Kong. This one was so small there was only room for a double bed and no dresser. Kinda gives meaning to the term, living out of a suitcase. And if you\'re a little on the large size, the bathroom may prove a challenge. Fitted with a shower only, but well stocked with personal sized shampoo, conditioner, etc.\r\nBut...the room was air conditioned and you can open the window a bit to breathe in that fresh New York air if you so choose. The room was cleaned to spotless daily and also had an in-room safe - something we always appreciate.\r\nWe tried none of the amenities, so have no comment there.\r\nThe staff was courteous, but the front desk appeared to be understaffed at times, resulting in longer wait times than we would have liked.'
1,'Desperately Seeking Renovation','So arrived with a reservation for a king non-smoking room and was told my room type was not available and I had to take a double bed or smoking room. Took the double and walked in on a 50 year old fat guy in his tighty whities. WTF? Back to lobby and given chain smokers\' cracker box room overlooking trash cans. The room was worse than a motel 6 as it hadn\'t been updated since Nixon was in office. Left and went to Intercontinental, which is a great hotel!'
5,'Ottimo per visitare','Ottima posizione, di fronte al MOMA. Walking time per gran parte delle attrazioni.\r\n4 isolati da Central Park, due isolati da Time Square,teatri di Broadway dietro l\'angolo.\r\nHo trascorso 3 magnifici giorni a New York. Devo dire che io e mia moglie non ci facciamo spaventare dalle distanze e dalla mole di cose da vedere. L\'Hilton è in posizione ottimale per tutto, la metro è vicina, Time Square si raggiunge a piedi in 5/10 minuti, di fronte c\'è Starbucks,dietro l\'angolo un bar aperto 24ore, ad un isolato (all\'angolo con la 7ma) c\'è uno stupendo locale per fare colazione (non buttate via i soldi in albergo...una città è da vivere dalle prime ore del mattino mischiandosi con i newyorkesi e riempiendosi di caffè,pancakes,eggs and bacon e spremuta! Si comincia la giornata con un piglio diverso...).\r\nNoi abbiamo prenotato da casa il NYcity pass+il sightseing bus che ti permette di salire e scendere quando vuoi. Subito sembra un po\' caro,ma alla fine abbiamo risparmiato. Non abiamo preso la metro ma solo il bus e poi abbiamo camminato tranquillamente ovunque.P.S. Il Nypass permette di noleggiare le bici gratis a Central Park + crociera a Ellis Island + tour di Harlem + ACCESSO A TUTTI I MUSEI.\r\nTornando all\'albergo, noi abbiamo prenotato tramite un broker in agenzia e abbiamo chiesto una camera standard. Abbiamo alloggiato al 23mo piano, una stanza decorosa,letto king size e bagno pulito. In albergo dopo le 23 si entra solo mostrando la chiave alla security.Servizio di concierge moltodisponibile, consiglianoforniscono materiale ed eventualmente prenotato visite,spettacoli,ecc.\r\nDevo comunque ringraziare trip advisor perchè la mia scelta è stata fortemente influenzata dal punteggio e dai commenti di altri viaggiatori.\r\nSicuaramente ci va anche fortuna per trovare una stanza comoda e pulita, nel nostro caso non possiamo dire nulla. Camera pulita e spaziosa. Comunque, basta che sia pulita. Alla fine,se si va a NY per visitare in albergo ci si va a notte fonda e si lascia la camera al mattino presto (complice il fuso orario....)'
3,'Marquis in NY City','Right in the middle of everything.....glitzy, loud and bustling. I find this hotel to be les than desirable when it comes to security and noiisy to boot. Upper level Club rooms are best ( of course) but lots of other hotels to choose from including sevreal other Marriots if that\'s your preference. Nice bedding that is changed after every guest...nice to know.'
2,'Probably wouldn\'t go back - unless it was one heck of a sale','Stayed here for three days in mid-January. \r\nThe downsides: \r\nThe bathroom was ridiculously small –even for NYC standards. The shower was a 3x3ft tiled cubby area with no where to put your shampoo and conditioner except the floor – gross. It was literally an open shower and the shower curtain stopped about 18 inches above the floor so everytime you showered, the floor of the rest of the bathroom was soaked. The sink was in an exact replica cubby opposite the shower – you couldn’t even get close enough to the mirror to put makeup on and there was no room on the sink to place any toiletries. I wish I had brought flip-flops to wear in the shower because it just creeped me out. \r\nThe room was very dark – there were times when we went back to the room to change and had every light on and still had a hard time seeing – you definitely couldn’t read in this room for a long period of time. The lighting really was very poor. \r\nSome of the previous posters who have their pictures on here aren’t kidding – the paint is literally peeling off the ceilings and walls and there were some spots on the ceiling of apparent water damage.\r\nThe heat – oh my – it worked too well! I know we’re the oddballs on this topic, but we love cold temps. We kept turning the heat off and while we were out, the maid kept turning it back on! This wasn’t really a downside! Just a personal preference and kind of a running joke while we were there. \r\nThe iron – yuck. Not only was the actual iron nasty looking – crusty water stains on it – but the ironing board only had a dirty, stained liner on top of it. It wasn’t a padded liner either – it looked like a thin cotton liner that literally was all stained up. I had a nice white cotton blouse that had gotten pretty wrinkled in my bag and decided not to wear it because I didn’t want it touching that board or iron. \r\nThey charge you a mandatory $3 per bag to store your luggage. I’ve only stayed at one other hotel ever in my life that did that. I think that’s a rip-off.\r\nThe plus sides: \r\nThe actual room was big – just the bathroom was tiny. \r\nThe elevators were fast and we never really had to wait for one for more than 20 seconds.\r\nI never heard our neighbors at all\r\nThey seemed to have a lot of people at the front counter so checkin & checkout went pretty quickly.\r\nWe got a good price. \r\nThe hotel is in a nice location – convenient to many subway stops. \r\nHonestly, I probably wouldn’t stay here again. Although our room was large, the darkness of it along with the overall feeling of it being dirty because of the peeling paint and the tiny small bathroom with the nasty shower made the whole room seem dirty even though it really wasn’t. . In my opinion there are too many other hotels in the city to explore. I’ve tried this one and while I wouldn’t tell someone to never stay here if they got a good price, I’ve been there & done that!! I’m going to try someplace new next time.'
2,'Decent value for Manhattan...great location...everything else subpar.','Recently stayed here during a work trip during days where many of my usual NYC hotels were overpriced and highly expensive so I saw this one through a search engine site and booked it. I did so purely for it\'s location - and indeed, the location is great. Only a few blocks from Central Park and basically centralized in the heart of Manhattan, it is perfect.\r\nThe hotel itself is subpar. The service was decent at the front desk, but I had trouble logging onto the WIFI in my room (wasn\'t a problem with my computer, I think I was just in bad range of the signal). The staff kept passing me to different people and after being put on hold for 15 minutes, I just hung up. I had to go down to the lobby to get any internet access.\r\nThe rooms themselves need a desparate overhaul, both for appearance and cleanliness purposes. The carpets were dirty, the A/C system was very outdated and it seemed like it was either freezing or hot in there. It reminds you of rooms at the Days Inn, which isn\'t neccessarily that bad but for the $200+ you\'re probably paying, it\'s a shame. When I checked out at 4AM to catch a cab to Penn Station, the Valet gave me a look like he didn\'t even want to go outside to hail a cab for me. \r\nOverall a poor experience; the location is great, so if you\'re stuck with a budget this isn\'t a bad option. In the end, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room while you\'re in New York City? But there are better options.'
2,'$680.00 per night - bad value','I was at this hotel on a one night business stay. I could not find a decent hotel any where in New York at a cheaper rate at this time of the year. I booked the Hilton thinking that I would get what my money was worth, but how wrong could I have been.\r\nMy company paid $680.00 per night for an executive room, the room was big but it was very dated and in need of modernisation.\r\nThe furniture was old and needed to be replaced.\r\nThe morning of my meeting I woke up to find my shower was not working. My husband had to call twice before anyone came up.\r\nThis hotel is very busy; the reception area is full of business travellers. There are also lots of conferences going on at this hotel.\r\nI missed the complimentary breakfast in the executive lounge but my husband said that is was pretty bad and not even worth eating.\r\nThe hotel is in a very good location and that about the only good thing.\r\nOverall the stay was ok but I would have expected more for the money my company paid!'
4,'Grand Building...','A very expensive Bed and Breakfast. The staff were a little abrupt at times. The rooms however were perfect...'
3,'Money pinching Nasty Receptionists','After a long journey we arrived at hotel ignored by receptionist then told we were to early to book in and to come back later, I asked at that time if the room was the twin one that I had requested I was told yes it was and the room would ready at 3. When we returned and saw a different receptionist we were told that we would have to pay an additional $25 + tax per night for the twin room, also if you want a fridge in your room that was another $20 per night. The icing on the cake was we had to pay them to keep our luggage for 5 hours on checking out day. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and I have never paid for luggage storage before. If you stay at this hotel it is in a good position and the beds are comfy but beware you will pay for unaccountable extras'
5,'21st-27th November','We stopped here from the 21st-27th November, amazing hotel, we were put on the 27th floor which was great :), had a double standard room which was gorgeous and the beds where so comfy, which is a bonus after all the walking we did. The Grand hyatt is within walking distance off all the sights i.e the Empire State Building, Grand central station (next door), Rockerfella Plaza, 34th Street (macys), 5th Avenue, The Library, Times Square, Central Park is a bit further but still in walking distance, plus many more places to visit. Didnt have much to do with the staff of the hotel, but the concierge are helpful. would definately stop here again and recommend it to everyone i speak to :)\r\nThe hotel will take a swipe of your credit card, as most hotels do, at the check in, but they will put a $100 per night charge on it, just incase you have room charges, but i wasnt informed of this when i checked in (i had never had this happen before), and as i had only a £500 limit on the card it maxed my card out and i couldnt do any shopping, which was highly disappointing as there were/are so many things to buy cheaper in New York. they dont actually take the money so you wont be charged by your bank.\r\nBut dont let this put you off, just make sure you take more than one card :)'

1,'NEVER AGAIN!','How do you know you\'ve arrived to Edison Hotel, Times Square:\r\n1. If you have to change rooms four times before you can get a clean room. \r\n2. If the rooms stink of damp and the bath tubs are rusty. \r\n3. If the reception, reservations and service staff talk to you like you\'re a piece of dirt. \r\n4. If you complain on checking into your room that there\'s hair on your mattress and pillows only to be given fresh ones with pubic hair on them instead. \r\n5. If you ring the hotel operator for help dialing a number only for them to tell you that your phone is not working. \r\n6. If the number on your in-room information leaflet for a local steak house puts you through to hotel reception.\r\n7. If when ringing reception from your room they keep telling you to hurry up because there\'s people queuing. \r\n8. If the color of the water coming out of your tap is brown. \r\n9. If reception staff tell you there is no availability to extend your stay only for you to find availability online five minutes later.\r\n10. If the heater in your room doesn\'t work. \r\nDo yourself a favor, DON\'T STAY THERE. I most certainly will never stay at this pathetic joke of a hotel ever again,'
4,'How to get a decent sized room at this great hotel','The Hudson is an amusing, trendy hotel in a GREAT location with a friendly, efficient staff that suffers from having many miniscule rooms. To ensure a decent sized room just ask for one with two beds. The price is very little more and the rooms big enough to fit two beds are often wonderful with corner windows and plenty of room.\r\nInfo from a visit of 4 days, Feb.10-14, 2005'
2,'Location great - hotel poor- staff rude !!!','We stayed in Hotel Pennsylvania - I booked last minute through a uk travel agent. On first impressions, location great, outside of hotel great and look of reception great. Then the 45 minute check-in put a dampner on our initial thoughts, and the rude staff at reception added to that. No apology for long wait. Our room - very basic, large but ok. Cleanish room, but very dated and needs renovating. The problems came after sleeping in beds both myself and my daughter bitten by bed bugs. Check-out as rude and abrupt as check-in. Was expecting more from hotel. Overall great location for all NYC attractions at budget rate but check bed for bugs !!!'
5,'A fantastic stay in the New Yorker','We booked the New Yorker for 5 nights. It was our first trip to New York and we were concerned that our hotel and accomodation were going to be ok. Well I must say the New Yorker was absolutely fantastic.The location is perfect and the facilities are fab. We were upgraded to an amazing corner room with fabulous views of the ESB and the New York skyline. Having the 24 tick tock diner was perfect and we eat there on several occasions. We could not fault the New Yorker in any way. We are already recommending the New Yorker to all our friends and family and I know that we will return to the New Yorker for another holiday. A big Thank You to Ruth on reception who was very friendly and made us feel so welcome on arrival.We will be back soon.'
5,'Loved the Marriott Marquis in Times Square!!!','Our family of 5 stayed at the Marquis for 7 nights the week of Easter. We have nothing but good things to say about our stay. We had a corner room on the 19th floor that overlooked Times Square. We also had access to the concierge lounge. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, especially the employees in the Concierge Lounge. Our corner room was very large and had a king bed, a fold out sofa and a rollaway and still plenty of room in the middle for the kids to play cards. The beds were so comfortable we are thinking of buying one. The elevators were absolutely no problem for us even though it was a busy week. In the lobby there were often employees walking around to help people who needed it. We never waited more than 5 minutes in the 8 days we were there, including the two evenings we went to the theater. We had read about elevator problems but did not experience any problems during our stay. The hotel has some incredible views from The View restaurant on top and the View Lounge on the 8th floor. The location was also wonderful. It was 3 short blocks to the Subway, close to Broadway shows, and an easy walk to many attractions. We would definitely stay there again! We loved it!'
2,'4-star facade but 3-star comfort in midtown Manhattan','I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania from November 9 - 16 2003. The location of the hotel is excellent - just directly opposite Penn Station with the subway just next to it. I paid $109 per night plus tax for a standard double room. Room 239 was spacious - it had a walk-in wardrobe complete with ironing facilities. However, the room showed signs of ageing. Wallpaper was peeling off from the wall. When I turned on the bathtub tap, rusty water flowed out. There was little space on the ledge above the washbasin to put toileteries. Information in the folder was outdated and there was no hotel stationery provided. The telephone charges are exhorbitant - toll-free calls cost 95 cents per call and a 5-minute long-distant call to New Jersey cost $19!! The hotel lobby, although spacious, was always crowded with people checking in and checking out or loitering around the theater booking counter. \r\nThe front desk staff were unfriendly and robotic - not a single smile on their face when checking in. I was not even informed that I had to present a credit card in order to activate the telephone line in the hotel room and there was no information on the telephone call charges. \r\nCheck out was a big hassle - the queue was long and the service slow - it took about half an hour to check out. Luggage storage was charged at $4 per piece. If you want a room in an excellent midtown Manhattan location with a reasonable price, Hotel Pennsylvania has it but be prepared for what I have just mentioned.'
5,'Super Cool Spot','I\'ve stayed in several places in NY but this has to be the coolest spot in the city. Ok, the rooms are a little on the small side and the lobby area can feel more like a nightclub after dark, but that\'s what makes this place so funky. \r\nPrices are on the high side (especially for us poor Brits now) but it\'s a great location near Central Park. There\'s an awesome little diner across the road (Flames) which serves great comfort food at really low prices. So much is within walking distance from here - I\'ll definitely be coming back here on my next trip.'
4,'the location of the hotel was more than great','hey everyone \r\nthis is riyadh a legal adviser at STC \r\ni stayed at Park Central for two days i have met a very nice people over there especially (Ellen) who is working at the front disk ,,she is so helpful and more than nice to our family,,,\r\nregards\r\nriyadh'
3,Bueno,'El hotel está situado justo al lado del Madison Square Garden, muy céntrico, con el metro justo en la puerta. Es un imponente edificio con más de 30 plantas. \r\nFuimos de viaje de novios y esperábamos que nos dieran alguna habitación especial, pero la verdad es que era bastante corriente. La habitación que nos dieron era más bien pequeña y la decoración te hacía evocar los años 20. Todo parecía antiguo, pero limpio y funcionando. El aire acondicionado sólo tenía 2 posiciones: frío glacial o apagado. Fuimos en septiembre, por lo que se estaba bien con el aire quitado.\r\nNos tocó la habitación en la planta 26 y apenas se escuchaban ruidos de la calle. \r\nEl restaurante de al lado, es el típico de las películas con los típicos sofás de piel roja, la camarera sirviendo café, super atenta y todo eso. Lo malo es que nos sacudieron como unos 30 dolares por desayunar, eso sí, 2 desayunos completos (cafe, zumo, tostadas, beicon, huevos, etc).\r\nEn fin, hotel ideal, si como nosotros, sólo vas a dormir y ya está. Si buscas hotel céntrico y bien comunicado, está perfecto. Si buscas lujos o algo económico, búscate otro.'
4,'Beautiful historical hotel','To be clear, I\'m a Hilton Diamond member and travel to a lot of Hilton properties throughout the world. I have a soft spot for this place, it have wonderful ambience and great historical beautiful that you find in only a few hotels in the world. The lobby is breathtaking. However, there are a few aspects of the hotel where it truly shows its age. The rooms aren\'t that big, bathrooms smaller yet for example. Internet can be spotty and the TV was out this morning in my room as well. Overall I like this place, it has tons of charm but there are better Hilton family options in Chicago.'
4,'Time square new year with kids','The Affinia offers suites - so it was a good choice for a family with 3 kids who wanted a place within walking distance of Time Square for New Year. The hotel staff were helpful. The suite had 2 bedrooms and a sofa bed - so it was fine. It was basic and clean; there was enough linen, toiletries and towels and when we asked for more it came. Good position. Fitness room ok - but no A/C and dreadfully hot. Kitchen basic but with cooker, fridge, microwave. Coffee and tea provided. Bell staff and concierges were very helpful. Overall good experience.'
5,Wonderful,'This was an incredibly speedy trip for business. 1 day. I arrived at 1pm, and left the next morning at 10am, but, it was lovely. Check in was speedy, courteous, and very friendly. The check in area was very visually pleasing. My room was ready at 1pm when I arrived, which was very appreciated. I was asked if I needed any extra pillows, and it was noted that my points were being updated, and asked if I needed help with evening plans. I even received a weather update. The room was very nice. I would have liked a nicer view, but, I wasn\'t in my room long. The bathroom was nice, the shower was nice. The bed was wonderful, and all was very clean. My luggage showed up quickly, as did my room service lunch. The food was good, and all the service was excellent. The location is wonderful also, very close to everything, and I would love to stay here again for pleasure or business. Check out was speedy, although I couldn\'t check out from my room, and the same gentleman checked me out as in, and commented that I may need a sweater if I was going out as it was a little chilly and raining. Altogether a lovely 1 day stay. I would recommend this to anyone, business or pleasure, families or not. Don\'t hesitate.'
5,'Wonderful Hotel, Great stay','Excelent Hotel, excelent location. I and my wife are happy. Thank you !!'
1,'Don\'t Bother','My meeting was a disaster. Internet repeatedly failed. Cell phones don\'t work well in meeting rooms. Temperature of room was either too hot or too cold. Management was unaccountable. The food made us queasy... The place has become dirtier since my last visit.'
3,'Not too bad for a budget hotel..but like something from a horror movie','After reading reviews on this site before going away, my husband and I were stressing about the hotel. I had even gone so far as to look into alternatives just in case. The hotel from the outside and in the lobby is fantastic. The staff at reception were really friendly and helpful, and we managed to check in within 5 minutes. The hotel even offers a free safety deposit box.\r\nI admit that the rooms, corridors etc are in need of urgent attention. The paint was peeling from every wall. The bathroom did need a good dusting and maybe cleaning with bleach to get rid of black mould in a few corners, but otherwise to room was clean and the bed was bed bug free. We were given a massive room with 2 double beds and a walk-in closet. The hotel did have a creepy feeling to it, but this was mainly due to the low lighting and looong corridors. In a way, it gave the hotel a bit of character.\r\nOur room and bathroom were cleaned every day, the cleaning staff were very friendly.\r\nAs our aim of the trip was to do sightseeing, we were only in the hotel in the late evening and out again in the early morning, so we were only using the room to store our stuff and to sleep. On this note, it is fine for a budget hotel. For people wanting luxury, probably best to look somewhere else.\r\nFor sightseeing, it is very central, right across the road from Madison Square Gardens, a block from the Subway, around the corner from Empire State Building, and about a 10 minute walk to Timnes Square.'
5,'A Grand time in the Hyatt!!','We went to New York on 30th December to stay for New Year and stayed for 4 nights. Our flight was delayed and when we arrived at the hotel it was 12.30am and our room had been booked out to other guests! The hotel was full! The manager couldn\'t have done more to put this right. He booked us into another hotel for our first night, paying our cab fare. He upgraded our room for the next 3 nights we stayed, gave us vouchers for a complementary breakfast, left a bottle of wine, cheese, crackers and chocolates and an letter in our room, apologising for any inconvenience we had been caused. The room was lovely, the staff very friendly and the rest of our stay there was first class. We would definately stay there again. The location was ideal, right next to Grand Central Station and a short walk from 5th Avenue and Saks, Tiffanys etc. The doorman, Marty, was a mind of information on where we could eat, find jazz music or best times to view the sites. We would certainly recommend this hotel for anyones first visit to the \'Big Apple\'.'
1,'The worst hotel room ever','I had a very unpleasant stay at this hotel. The room in which I stayed at was by far the worst I have seen in my life. It was outrageously small, I barely space to open my bag, and I also didn\'t have a decent window. Furthermore, in case you are overweight, believe, you won\'t be able to enter in the bathroom, which is unacceptably tiny. \r\nI know that hotel rooms in NYC are smaller than average, but I have been in at least a dozen different hotels there, and this was by far the worst, and certainly it was not the cheapest. You can certainly get a better value for your money.'
4,'Great location, large room, excellent stay.','All of the negative reviews had me worried about a recent business stay at the Park Central Hotel. But aside from a few customer service glitches, the experience there was excellent. First of all, the location is perfect -- a few blocks from the park, a few blocks from Times Square, a few blocks from Fifth Avenue...you couldn\'t ask for more. The concierge level room I had was big and nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable, the linens were first rate, and the plasma screen t.v. was a nice bonus. \r\nThe only negative is that room service ends at 10 p.m., which seems rather ridiculous in New York City, where people are out incredibly late. Customer service is spotty -- some of the staff were incredibly helpful, some were indifferent...but overall, this was a nice room in a great location for a reasonable rate. You can\'t ask for more than that.'
3,'Bien situado pero viejo.','Nosotros estuvimos ya hace unos cuantos años pero tengo una buena anécdota: Al regresar a la habitación, situada en uno de los pisos más altos, a las dos de la madrugada; abrimos la puerta y escuchamos un fuerte estruendo. La ventana había salido volando con marco y todo. Menos mal que cayó en un patio porque si no estaríamos encerrados en Guantánamo todavía.\r\nSe conoce que la ventana estaba un poco abierta y al abris la puerta se hizo una espacie de corriente que la arrancó de cuajo.\r\nBajamos a recepción y para expicar lo que había sucedido no encontramos a nadie que hablara español salvo un vigilante de seguridad. Tras la oportunas explicaciones, nos dieron otra habitacion pero no pareció extrañarles lo que les habíamos contado. A lo mejor ya les había pasado antes...'
4,'Our New York Family Vacation','Recently took our 2 college age daughters to New York for a family vacation for 5 days. I was thrilled to find great airfare, but shocked when I started looking at hotels and prices! Location, reputation and a fresh designed hotel were our priorities. Upon checking in our hotel & room we were quite pleased. Front desk and concierge were adequate and average. The room was newly updated, very clean and fresh and great size (for a NYC hotel room) to comfortably accomodate our adult family of 4. Within 15 minutes housekeeping knocked on our door to check if everything was satisfactory and immediately brought some additional items we requested. Bathroom was average size and could have had more shelf/storage space. Double beds (not Queen) were comfortable. Biggest negative was walls are thin and could occasionally hear people talking in the next room. (that\'s why I bring earplugs on trips) Hotel is not known to have extrodinary window views of the city. Location was excellent, only a few blocks from Rockefeller Center, Central Park, shopping & Times Square. Great vacation and nice contemporary hotel, but expensive. My Hilton Honors got us free use of their great exercise facility each day, but Internet was ridiculously expensive ($1 a minute!!) FYI not all rooms have been renovated at this time, so make sure you ask for an updated room.'
5,'Luxurious hotel','Arrived at this hotel late in the evening having been up over 30 hours from travelling. We asked for a quiet room as we were so exhausted and couldnt bear the thoughts of being disturbed. We were given a room on the 34th floor and all I can say is it was AMAZING! The views of the city were beautiful and having booked a twin room we were pleasantly suprsied to be given a large room with 2 double beds. The beds were so comfortable, I had one of the best night\'s sleep of my life lol. Also had a plasma TV and nice shower too.'
5,'Perfect stay!','My husband and I stayed for one night (8/5) and had a fantastic experience. I read some of the negative comments/complaints and I would like to encourage readers considering this hotel not to hesitate. Our experience was flawless. We were treated with the utmost respect and courtesy from the front door to room service. We booked our room through priceline and got a phenomenal deal! When we checked in, the clerk upgraded us to a deluxe corner suite with panoramic views of times square on the 33rd floor. We paid a fraction of the retail price of a standard room and ended up staying in what proved to be one of the finest rooms of all our travels. They even gave us free access to their health club and we have no membership affiliations. Needless to say, we were thoroughly impressed. Please understand that the negative reviews/comments are isolated occurrences and book your stay! You will not be disappointed.'
5,'Lived up to Expectations','Having grown up in the suburbs I had always heard about the Palmer House and have wanted to stay there for years. Finally over the last Christmas Holiday I had occasion to do so. We had an incredible time at the Hotel. \r\nI would like to mention Doug at the Front Desk and Claudia the Front Desk manager who made our stay wonderful. \r\nThe Lobby is absoulutely gorgeous as everybody else mentioned, not much more to say about that.\r\nWe were upgraded to a suite which was very nice and really made our trip, as it was cold and there wasn\'t too much outdoor sightseeing to do. We were able to celebrate our son\'s Birthday in the suite and have our whole family over to watch the Bear\'s game, where if they would have won they would have gone to the Playoffs. (Don\'t get me started on that)\r\nThe suite had been remodeled and was very spacious, the other thing we noticed about the room that it was completely handicapped accessible. We thought that was great. \r\nMy only thoughts for the next time we stay there would be to request a room on the side of the hotel that is not nearest the El tracks. They take a little getting used to.\r\nThe beds were incredibly soft and comfortable. They have ice machines on the floor which is great, you don\'t need to order room service to get a bucket of ice. There\'s a Corner Bakery and a CVS pharmacy within 50 feet of the hotel if you forget anything or just wanted to grab some munchies for the room.\r\nI hope this helps and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It\'s truly historic Chicago. We also discovered a great restuarant a couple blocks North on Michigan Avenue called The Gage, we ate there twice during our 3 day stay in the city.'
4,'Delightful weekend','We arrived on a Saturday around 10:30 am and were pleased that a room was available then. We dropped our bags and headed to 6th Avenue which was closed from 42nd to 54th for a street fair/flea market. My wife was in heaven. We saw a show that evening and two on Sunday, all within walking distance. The location is superb. \r\nThe room was clean and bright as well as comfortable. Hotel food was typical of New York, very expensive so we ate our meals out. there were excellent choices for breakfast across the street and around the corner.\r\nWe got the room on points at 12,000 per night. Right now it is up to 16,000. To my way of thinking that was a steal.\r\nCheck out was easy and we caught a taxi to the airport out front with almost no wait.\r\nWe would stay there again.'
3,'Suits its purpose','Yes it is a sound reliable hotel but nothing special. If you are looking for something to fit in with a dream holiday then this is not for you. Clean, tidy, well located hotel. But very very busy so services fits in with that. Reception is run ragged day in day out. If you want a safe central warm hotel as a base for a frantic New York break then this is perecftly adequate.\r\nJ,C and H'
4,'Middle of the action, first-rate rooms','We booked this through Hotwire at a steep discount (though ultimately a reasonable price) and couldn\'t have been happier. The rooms are top-of-the-line -- new furniture, great bedding, excellent bathroom, and everything spotless. Huge by NYC standards as well. Three complaints: takes forever to get up or down to/from high floors on the elevator (normal), computer in the business center had a broken keyboard (kinda normal), and bellman somehow couldn\'t hail a cab in 15 minutes of our waiting (not normal, we ended up walking a few blocks to get one). Otherwise, a great hotel and perfect spot in Times Square.'
4,'Posizione Eccezionale','Io e mio marito (quarta volta a New York) abbiamo pernottato presso questa struttura l\'8 e il 9 Dicembre e ci siamo trovati veramente bene: la struttura è standard, qualitativamente nella media ma la sua posizione è stupenda.\r\nMetropolitana vicina. Personale disponibilissimo e gentile sempre con il sorriso in bocca. Camere pulite. A due passi dalle principali mete newyorkesi.\r\nColazione: consiglio di prendere il pacchetto solo pernottamento perchè di fronte l\'albergo c\'è Starbucks e attorno l\'albergo ci sono 100 mila posti dove poter organizzare la colazione a base di cappuccino e brioches o altro .... c\'è di tutto, credetemi.'
1,'Disgusting and gross','Horrible experience with poor front desk management skills. Our first room had over 1 foot of water in the tub after we tried to shower. Took a while for it to be fixed, and we were offered to switch rooms for our troubles. It took hours for them to switch our room, and the new room had a broken AC. Could not sleep all night. We canceled our third night, and went back home with a bitter taste. Also the dingy dark hallways, concealed the stained carpets. I would never stay here again! It was miserable!'
3,'Mixed experiences at the Hudson','Whilst there were good points about this hotel, I have to say I can see where many of the negative comments posted are coming from. I think it depends on whether the beautiful design makes you more forgiving of other issues. We stayed here because we wanted a unique NYC experience and appreciate good design (you can stay at a Hilton in any city after all), and we did get that and enjoy our stay. This was definitely a plus point, it looked great. We were lucky with our room too as had upgraded to a superior room after reading reviews, so we has plenty of space, it was a corner room so plenty of windows and light, clean, cool design and a suprisingly decent sized bathroom (and high enough up on 17th floor to avoid being disturbed by the noisy bar). Ask for room 1700 if you want to be certain of a decent room!! The bar looked great and was always busy, but we quickly discovered that this was a beautiful place for pretentious, unfriendly people(both staff and residents!), so sought out more down to earth places to spend our money and didnt really take full advantage of the communal areas. It would have been nice if someone had told us (even apologised) for the sky terrace being closed for renovation, as this had been a factor in our choosing to stay here: instead when we asked, we were told \'you know what, its closed\' - well thanks for the info! Whilst some staff were friendly and helpful, I have to say that generally that wasn\'t the case and there was a definite feeling that we ought to consider ourslves lucky to be staying there rather than the other way round. Location on the edge of the fantastic central park , the amazing whole foods market in the Time Warner centre and subway opposite a real plus (it was easy to explore the whole of manhattan using the subway, though if you intend to spend you time discovering the rather more interesting and \'real\' downtown, you might consider staying south of midtown). Overall, we were happy with our room and impressed by the design, but the snobby vibe meant that really we didnt fully take advantage (or want to) of the facilities it had to offer. An interesting place with not-so interesting people. I enjoyed the stay but not sure I\'d go back.'
1,'Stay away from Hotel Pennsylvania in NY. The staff is so rude and unpleasant especially Raquel & Flora being the highlight','I had the worst experience in NY ever cuz of the rude service from the front desk they r absolutely rude. The hotel is dirty and smelly its just not worth even $10 staying in there. U will be very disappointed & they will ruin ur stay in NY cuz of their bad altitude @ the front desk especially Flora & Raquel. Its not worthed stay away from this hotel. After ur bad experience @ the front desk u go to ur room upstairs the hallway & the rooms look like a funeral home I\'m for real u will find out if u stay near this hotel go visit & see how true this is....'
4,'Great Hotel','We booked the Marriott Marquis to stay at after our cruise. I was little skeptical at first , because of the reviews, but once we arrived we were very pleased. The room was big and very clean and the beds were comfortable. It is a very large hotel and I can see where it can come across to some as impersonal, but when we did encounter staff members, the were very friendly and helpful. \r\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone and would not hesitate to stay here again!'
5,'I really enjoyed my weekend stay at the Palmer House.','The Hotel is so pretty. The staff was really helpful and on post to greet you and offer help. The beds were really comfortable. The room was nice. We had two bathrooms which were a little small. I have no complaints. I do plan to return soon.\r\nLinda Porter\r\nDecatur, IL'
3,'Don\'t check in if you want to sleep','The location and the design of the hotel is attractive. Small rooms and tiny bathrooms. Clean and with wooden floors etc. They could pay a bit more attention to maintenance though. Helpful staff!!! \r\nBut the issue with this hotel is the party culture. In particular during summer season. They want you to join the clubbing, very loud music, coctails etc. And you van just forget to relax in your room, watch a movie in your room, get some work done, talk to somebody on the phone, read a book. And you can\'t sleep until the party is finished (and that\'s long after midnight every day). \r\nIf you want to sleep you can consider this hotel in Jan, Feb and possibly Mar. But find somewhere else to stay for the rest of the year.'
4,'Great location, clean and affordable','I took my 12 year old son to NYC for Spring Break - decided on the Edison because it was so close to everything - it was great - sure the place is old (rusty bathtub/dated wallpaper,etc.) but it is clean and the service was great - from the front desk to the lobby securtiy - We were on the 12th floor and yes - we could hear the traffic outside - but no noise from the surrounding rooms! We will definately stay here again!'
5,'Sehr Gut','Die Lage des Hotels ist sensationell und hervorragend. Aus dem Zimmer im 32. Stock hatte man eine grandiose Aussicht. Die Einrichtung des Zimmers war einfach aber sehr zufriedenstellend. Mitarbeiter sind Zuvorkommend und versuchen etwaige Wünsche und/oder Anforderungen jedweder Art mit voller Motivation zu erfüllen.'
4,'Great Location, Very Good Service, Comfortable stay','My husband and I spent 10 nights here on our recent first visit to NY. And I have to say that even though we were a bit put off by some negative reviews, we really had to struggle to find fault with this hotel. \r\nI will start with the negatives first:\r\n1. The hotel is expensive (although we did not spend any of our money there because we had a $500 credit to use on food and beerage as a courtesy form Virgin Holidays as the hotel closed the club lounge) BUT so are most hotels in NY. What else do you expect right? A glass of champagne - $20; in house breakfast for 1 was $40 and just OK. A lunch meal and a few drinks (maybe 4 drinks or so) came up to about $120. Of course you do not have to eat at the hotel because there are loads of cheaper places around. Like I said we had a complimentary stipend to spend and we made the most of it.\r\n2. The room was a bit dim with ok views (38th floor) but still very comfortable to return to for the 10 nights we were there. In fact even the elevator was very dark and you struggled to see very well in there.\r\n3. Be careful when moving around the drinks in the fridge and putting your own in there as the charges are automatically calculated based on weights. We were a bit surprised at the bill and when we queried it further, we got them to remove all the charges for the items that we did not use form the fridge.\r\nFor us those were the only faults we could find with the hotel. Overall staff were always very polite with us. We spent a lot of time in the Shula\'s restaurant and bar downstairs mingling with staff and were always treated well (special mention of the friendly Jody). Regarding the food itself at Shula\'s, the quality was excellent and the portions were just right. \r\nWe also returned in the wee hours in the morning from heading out into Greenwich village and the staff would still be friendly and welcoming.\r\nOn the location, you cannot ask more of the hotel for being one block from the lively Times Square, Theatre District, some good restaurants in Hell\'s Kitchen and the subway (42nd street).\r\nI would certainly return to the Westin or any starwood hotel for that matter.'
4,'Trendy and contemporary hotel - clean but small rooms','If you go to the Big Apple and want to stay on the move this hotel would be ideal for you. On the other hand, if you are one that wants to spend a fair amount of time in your hotel room we would recommend a different hotel. While this hotel was clean and affordable, the rooms were extremely small, to the point of being uncomfortable for two persons to move around in. Most closets are bigger than the bathrooms.'
5,'Hotel recomendado','Acabo de llegar de alí y puedo decir que es un hotel más que correcto. \r\nEs limpio y la situación es inmejorable (a 3 minutos de Central Park, al lado de Times Square y a 10 minutos o menos de la Quinta Avenida).\r\nEl único pero es que es la primera vez que veo un hotel en el que te guarden la maleta en recepción cobrándote 3.50 dólares por maleta.\r\nCuando vuelva a Nueva York, sin duda me alojaré de nuevo en este hotel.'
1,'A motel at best','We stayed there for two nights with customers. What a shame to have brought customers here! The hotel is very far from the hyatt standard. The rooms need major remodeling. Very low key, paint chipped, dirty old wall papers. Nothing besides the bare minimum furniture. The bathroom was that of a motel. Super small with an old dirty tub and a tiny sink with nothing to put your toiletry on. Carpet in the room had not been laid down properly. Phone didn\' t work. It took over an hour to get a stopper for the tub despite the hotel manager getting involved. We changed rooms twice hoping to get a slightly better one but ended up giving up as they were all as terrible as the others. Just a bad experience. Except for sleeping as beds are ok and it is quiet. Shame on hyatt for misleading customers thinking they are booking in a higher standard hotel. This is a motel at best!'
5,'Wonderful Experience','I went to newyork with my Dad for my 21st, November last year. We only had one problem whilst we was there which was that the locker was broke, service was okay... however they didnt have the availability for us to move rooms and maintenance were unable to come out to fix it. We used a safety deposit box free of charge for the rest of the holiday which was absolutley fine. Staff were pleasant... Location = AMAZING. Hotel is a terminal to grand central so getting the tube was easy. We basically walked everywhere... seeing the sights ect.... amazing!! Would stay here again!! we was told before we went that you could here lots outside so wouldnt be able to sleep!! i found it very peaceful to sleep... :-) definatly recommend this hotel and would stay again!!'
5,'Excellent Stay','I stayed at this hotel on a business trip and it was really great. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and my room was impeccable. My complaints would be long waits for the elevator and only 4 computers in the business area. However, they do have free wi-fi in the lobby if you want to bring your computer downstairs. Since I was there on business I was ok with the location, however there were not as many restaurants as I am used to in a downtown area. Ask the valets if you have any specific questions - they are more helpful than the concierge! I was a little disappointed that the concierge would just give me the standard spiel. Overall, a great place to stay and very nice ambience. \r\nI did not pay for this room - or see the bill - so I can not comment on its price.'
5,'Comfortable, versatile, great location!','We had a wonderful stay. Our room was exceptionally neat and comfortable and also spacious and quiet. We loved the convenience of the bars and restaurants and had so much fun just exploring this magnificant space. The location is next to the Art Institute and Crown Fountain. It is not a budget hotel, but you get so much for what you pay for--a total package.'
3,'Regalo di un viaggio aNew York','Hotel mediocre con una moquette stagionata nelle stanze. Le finestre chiuse ermeticamente non consentono un ricambio adeguato dell\'aria. La pulizia lascia a desiderare cosi\' come il rifacimento della stanza. Enorme casermone con centinaia di stanze raggiungibili da corridoi senza fine. In apparenza impianti di sicurezza adeguati. Vicinissimo a Central Park, basta uscire dall\'hotel per espirare l\'aria elettrizzante della città.'
3,'Not fancy, but great location','First of all, I was worried about staying in this hotel after reading all of the horrible reviews. I wasn\'t sure what to expect when I got there, but was pleasantly surprised. The check in took about 30 minutes, but the staff were friendly and even upgraded our room without being asked. The rooms were not fancy, but they were clean and had everything you would need. The staff were very friendly and helped us to pick out attractions to go and see. They even booked the tickets and gave detailed directions.\r\nThe location was FANTASTIC! Literally across the street from Pen Station and Madison Square Gardens. Times square was easy to walk to and Central Park was just a bit farther along the road. \r\nCan\'t beat the location and price. As long as you\'re not looking for luxury, you\'ll be happy with the hotel! There is even a Tim Horton\'s next door!'
3,'Location great but service very poor','This hotel is in a great location but the service is very poor and generally very expensive \r\nI suggest that to have breakfast out as you will find better quality within yards of the hotel \r\nI also used the phone in my room a 4 minute call to the UK cost me $115.00 us dollars whilst I fully understand an International call will be expensive I feel this is too expensive\r\nI also went swimming with my daughter we were charged $10 dollars each for swimming hats \r\nFinally, when checking out of the hotel my wife needed a cash point she spoke to the concierge and said she had run out of Dollars so he walked away leaving me with the luggage as he clearly felt he wasn’t going to get a tip!!'
4,'Great spot - kitchen is a bonus!','Excellent location. 2 blocks to Macy\'s, 4 blocks to Times Square and across from Penn Station. We had a studio room on the 3rd floor. Room was huge! Full kichen, decent sized full bathroom and king sized bed. The only downfall was the noise. Being so close to street level, the night time noise was awful. Ask for a high-level room!\r\nThe kitchen was handy for breakfast. There is a deli just downstairs to pick up some bits. Good hotel and great value for the money.'
4,'Great Value','Our family with 13 year old daughter stayed at the Westin Nov 21-25 2008. I booked through bidding and got a very low rate. I arrived 1 hour before checkin, but they were very nice and gave me a room on a high floor with the 2 double beds we needed.\r\nWe had the view out over the Hudson towards New Jersey and I really enjoyed the large window. the standard room was medium size for New York and nicely updated with a really good HD plasma television. The bathroom is very small, but newly remodeled and nice. \r\nI loved everything about this hotel. While we were staying there the Phoenix hockey team and Wayne Gretzky were staying and there was always buzz out front with fans waiting. \r\nPossible issues are that there is only one dining option inside the hotel - Shula\'s expensive steakhouse. You will need to go to Starbucks on bottom floor or outside hotel to eat, which really isn\'t a problem. Lobby isn\'t tremendously huge and splendid, but plenty of seating, if needed.\r\nFavorite meal was a light brunch at Sarabeth\'s on Central Park West.'
5,'Excellent hotel, Great Location!','This hotel is in a great location. Within walking distance of Central Park, Rockefeller Centre and Times Square. I stayed here with two friends for three nights, spacious room with two double beds with the most comfortable mattress toppers, pillows and duvets. Plenty of storage space and an abundance of clean towels and lovely Crabtree and Evelyn bathroom products. We had a great view from the 21st floor, our room was on the corner so we could see up to Central Park! \r\nThe continental breakfast was really nice. Plenty of fresh fruit, yogurts, cereal and rolls with jams or my favourite, cream cheese and smoked salmon.\r\nThe staff were really polite and helpful. You will get a taxi outside the Lobby within seconds.\r\nI am a fussy traveller and I highly recommend this hotel, you won\'t be disappointed!'
3,'Muy mal servicio pero lo demas bien.','Ya había leido que tenias que hacer mucha cola para hacer el Check-in y pagamos un poco mas en la reserva para el club 5000, porque te evitabas las colas, te dan una habitación mejor y entra el desayuno. Lo de las colas... pringamos como todos. Unos 45 minutos hasta que nos atendieron. El chaval de la recepción no tenia ni idea del horario del desayuno. La situación del hotel: genial. La habitación estaba bien, las vistas, lo mejor, al Empire State. El desayuno tambien bien, aunque el espacio un poco reducido para tanta gente. En el club 5000 hay internet gratis.'
4,'Amazing location!','We stayed at Hotel Pennsylavania in January 2012 and were very happy with our stay. As the other reviewers have stated, it is in the most amazing location, opposite Madison Square garden and in short walking distance of some of New York\'s best tourist spots - Empire state building, Times Square etc and if you want to take the metro instead, you only have to cross the road.\r\nThe hotel itself is comfortable and safe, with rooms being cleaned and tidied daily. The decor is a little old fashioned but this only seems to add the shabby chicness of Hotel pennsylvania.'
2,'GREAT location, RUDE staff, HIGH prices, OKAY room','This was our second stay at the Park Central and will definetly be our last. I booked 3 rooms for August. I asked for early check in as some of our family were arriving earlier than the 4 pm check-in. \r\nWhen we arrived we noticed that the lobby had been completely redone, very nice, however it did not make up for the a**hole we had to deal with at check-in. We asked if our other family members had arrived and were told that was a security issue and he couldn\'t tell us. After a long arguement he did call their room and said there was no answer so either they hadn\'t checked in or they were out. ** We found out later our family had left an important message for us at the desk which we received they day we checked out!**\r\nWe were told we had to return at 4 pm as our room wouldn\'t be ready until then but we could leave our bags in the secure area, however the FEE to do this is $3.75 per bag. I\'m thinking with the $200+ per night per room (plus extra for internet) we were paying this was a bit ridiculous.\r\nWe ended up having to speak to a manager and she put us in a room that was ready (not the original one intenede for us) so everyone with us stored their luggage there.\r\nThe room smelled bad, the bathroom was moldy, the shower handle was broken, the tub plug didn\'t work, the sink plug didn\'t work. The room was tiny and the King bed didn\'t quite look big enough, The view was the other side of the hotel - brick with windows all around and an empty pit in the centre. I asked the cleaning staff to please exchange the feather pillows for foam, I was told to ask the front desk, which I did. We were there for 4 nights - I NEVER got a foam pillow (I exchanged one with other family) nothing ever gets fixed and it is very annoying.\r\nThe only thing that was good was the breakfast, hot and cold choices but expensive at $35 each. Our favorite waiter was Winston, he was the friendliest guy there - I think they should give him a job at the front desk :)\r\nSo while the location was great, it isn\'t enough to make me return a third time.'

1,'Extremely Noisy, Thin-Windows, Out-dated','Sadly, this is the first negative review that I must write. Generally, I have enjoyed many of my stays and rarely give a negative review, even if something does bother me. Things do go wrong, and you always have to give places a chance. \r\nOur stay was very poor, sleepless and stressful. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and staff are generally nice, but the rooms are less than desirable. Our room was a deluxe with a balcony. The room was very dated and visually unappealing. The windows were single-pane, drafty and had no sound-proofing whatsoever. With that being said, I should note that I have stayed in the city on numerous occasions and have an understanding that the city is a very noisy place. \r\nUnfortunately, given the previous, we were on the side of the hotel which was directly above a fire/ems/police station. On a regular interval (5-10 minutes) you would be startled awake by the departure of an emergency vehicle. Due to our lack of sleep, at about 2:30 a.m., I contacted the front desk and they were more than happy to move us to a different room. Unfortunately, this was located on the same side of the building, but the sirens were more muffled. However, our luck ran out when a group of people began socializing in the room next-door. We didn\'t mind, until they began smoking marijuana feverishly. Again, the hotel responded to our request and immediately dispatched security to resolve the issue. \r\nOverall, the hotel was responsive to our requests, but the quality of the hotel definitely needs improvement.'
4,'have stayed here 5 years in a row','very good hotel hence have stayed here five years running beautiful lobby and in an ideal location for the shopping if can\'t afford mag mile, rooms can be small but in my experience they will move you if requested. Having said that the bathrooms can still be quite tiny though .The beds are extremely comfy and the staff are lovely .The afternoon tea is a real treat ( you have book in advance) .will be back this nov for our 6th year annual trip . Love chicago :)'
4,'Great Hotel','Good size rooms. Very clean. Lovely big foyer. Great view of Chrysler Building from our window. Comfortable beds. Next door to Grand Central Station.'
2,'edison nyc','after just returning from our stay at the edison hotel we were very dissapointed in the rooms and services .firstly we looked around the lobby of the hotel and check in area and were impressed by the decor and there lovely christmas tree ,then went to check in the staff never smiled once we then took the lift to the 15th floor and it was like being in a time warp.the rooms have nt seen new decor in years and the bathroom was tiny ,it was so dissapointing .i cant complain in its location but to come back to nice suroundings after being out all day would have nice to'

3,'you get what you pay for','I think the Park Central is an excellent alternative to other pricey Manhattan hotels. I found the hotel to be clean, and the staff was friendly. As for the size of the rooms, I found that for a New York hotel, they had plenty of space. The people who disagree obviously have never been to Europe. It is also conveniently located between Central Park and Times Square. But here are some pitfalls to expect: the check-in time is kind of late, 4 p.m. However, the hotel does have a luggage check that only costs $3 a bag. If you want wireless internet, it will cost $12 per day. The water pressure is very low, so just plan on a little more time in the shower. Other than that, my boyfriend and I were very satisfied with our first stay in New York.'
4,'Excellent Location For The Money.','I have just returned from a College trip this morning and wanted to reassure other folk that this hotel is really not as bad as some folk said it was. \r\nFirstly the location is brilliant, you are so close to the Empire State Building , Madison Square Gardens, Time Square, Macy\'s, Dunking Donuts is right next door (what more could a person want??!!!) lol.\r\nWe all had a brilliant time and the room was extremely spacious with two king sized beds. One word of warning though, the bathroom really is as horrid as many say it is. On the plus side though, the shower was very efficient and plenty of clean towels. The maids always cleaned the rooms efficiently and made our beds nicely.\r\nA word of warning to all youngsters intending on staying here, we did not encounter a safety deposit box in our room, so be warned to look after your hard earned cash.\r\nThe shopping in New York/Manhattan is absolutely wonderful however the department store staff are extremely pushy and try to force you to buy all sorts of stuff you may not want at all. If you have a very limited budget just tell them, otherwise you could waste a whole heap of cash on un-necessary goods you can\'t really afford. If you shop in Macy\'s or Bloomingdales and are British, you can tell them this info and show your passport, then they give you an 11\% discount (possibly the tax). It really isn\'t that much cheaper to buy cosmetics or health and beauty items in the department stores in New York compared to the UK, however I discovered when I reached JFK that my Chanel perfumes and aftershaves were cheaper there, so take a tip and get them at JFK, if you are a lover of Chanel ...no Chanel make-up available at JFK though.\r\nOne great tip to get around cheaply is, buy a Metro card and use the subway as its so much cheaper, quicker and easier than cabs. A word of warning to youngsters though if you do travel the subway..make sure you get off at the correct stop and don\'t over-shoot it, as we felt very conspicuous as a group of four, waiting for the next one to take us back to our stop. We were obviously tourists who were a little scared by the intimidating looks we were getting, luckily no harm came to us.\r\nPlease be re-assured that the positive things about the hotel really do outweigh the negative, so go and enjoy the trip. Don\'t over buy your souvenirs though and exceed the luggage allowance as British Airways check-in at JFK would have charged us $50 a kilo had we been over our allowance.'
4,'glamour e centrale','l\'hotel hudson è molto carino, curato nei minimi dettagli, la hall è meravigliosa, per non parlare poi del giardino interno con annessa sala colazione, la sala biblioteca,la terrazza ed il club.... molto alla moda, arriva gente da tutta manhattan ma essendo ospiti dell\'hotel si salta la coda.La colazione è un pò cara ma in classico stile newyorkese,il personale è competente e molto disponibile, c\'è molto controllo e pulizia, unico neo sn le stanze un pò piccole anche se arredate divinamente e la poca luce nei corridoi e nell\'ingresso, per il resto è perfetto, buona qualità prezzo e centrale a 2 minuti dalla brodway e 5 dalla 5 th, 15 da soho in taxi i quali sn sempre pronti all\'ingresso dell\'hotel....non vedo l\'ora di tornarci!!!'
3,'Da ristrutturare...','L\'hotel, pur avendo dei buoni servizi di base ed essere in ottima posizione vicino a Times Square, è abbastanza scarso. Camere piccole e vecchie, bagni molto ristretti, puzza nel corridoio, ecc... Tuttavia vista la posizione e il prezzo (molto basso rispetto ad altri alberghi della zona se si riserva e si paga in anticipo) lo rendono comunque attrattivo per qualche notte a new york.\r\nDa evitare assolutamente è la colazione nell\'albergo... veramente scarsa e mal presentata, il tutto ad un prezzo superiore alla media in una sala da pranzo che sembra più un magazzino.'
2,'Good location, bad hotel, bad rooms!','NYC is a hard place to find good hotels with fair prices.\r\nI stayed in Hotel Pennsylvania in July 2009. The price was not so expensive, so I stayed with 3 more friends, for 4 nights.\r\nThe first room we were given was RIDICULOUS. Very dirty, the bed had blood on the sheets, the walls were kind of falling, also they gave us 2 queen beds and in our reservation we had asked for a room with 4 single beds.\r\nAfter some conversation, they gave us a better room on a higher floor. It seems that they are rebuilding the hotel and started from the higher floors. The room was better, I can not complain. It was a larger room, with 4 beds, and at least it was not dirty.\r\nThe hotel is very crowded, all the time. The facilities (internet at the lobby) are terrible. no WiFI at the time.'
5,'Perfect Location, Excellent Staff','Stayed with my girlfriend for 7 nights, March 3rd-10th. On arrival we were upgraded to a view room on 37th floor, no charge and the guy at reception was very friendly. Room itself was a bit small, expected that, and the bathrooms looked a bit old but the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless. Free WiFi in the rooms, hi speed(paid) and slower service(free). Free service fine for checking mails and news websites. Location next to MSG, Penn Station and only a short walk to Port Authority/Time Sq/Macys was perfect. House keeping staff, security and porter all excellent. Diner attached to hotel, choc chip pancakes for breakfast a must. Can be busy at times. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.'
5,'Perfect Location','First time in New York and delighted that we chose the Affinia Manhattan. Having seen the price of hotels in New York (high!), we were very happy to have booked direct with the hotel during their 9-day sale and got an excellent price. \r\nOur room, on the 17th floor was excellent. We had two large beds, a big lounge area with full sized sofa, proper dining room table and a large kitchen area. The kitchen included a full sized cooker and fridge/freezer and microwave, plus all the pots and pans, crockery etc that you might need. In addition, there was a good, modern coffee maker with fresh coffee (and tea) being replenished daily. The closet was a good size and contained an iron and ironing board and an all important safety deposit box inside the closet. The bathroom had a bath (tub) and overhead shower and contained a hair-dryer. \r\nThe room was kept spotlessly clean by the maid service and we found all the staff helpful and courteous. If people want to be picky, the bathroom was rather small, but as mentioned, it was always kept clean with towels being changed daily, along with replenished (good quality) toiletries. \r\nThe hotel is ideally situated in the heart of Manhattan and opposite Penn Station. Even though New York is a 24 hour city with heavy traffic constant sirens, we found the room to be a haven and the noise never kept us awake (must have been all that walking!). \r\nHope to return to New York in the not too distant future and the Affinia Manhattan will be our first choice – great hotel and could not fault it.'
5,'Amazing Rooms','We took a last minute trip to NYC last weekend and decided to go all out and stay the the Westin.......I was awesome....the first night we staying in a executive room on the 16th floor. Huge plasma TV, Computer, and spectacular bed.....when they say heavenly bed, they are not kidding. Very clean, modern, and great view. The second night we stayed in a corner room on the 35th floor. It was even more amazing......total of 5 windows including one in the bathroom. Even the shower was heavely with two huge showerheads that dump gallons of water on you.......Overall all experience was spectacular....will always go back to the Westin when we go back to NYC.'
5,'Great Location...Great Hotel','My husband and I just returned today from a wonderful stay at this hotel. We used Marriot points to get our room and at first was a bit hesitant on what type of room we would receive. We knew it would probably just be a basic one. Well, when we got there, we received great service from everyone. We were able to check in early and put all our stuff in our room and freshen up. They gave us a room on the 42nd floor! You know in NY the higher the better and we were pretty impressed. The room was very clean and stylish. Huge flat screen TV! Our favorite was how comfy the beds were. Your body melted right into the bed. Plenty of pillows and very comfortable sheets and blankets. \r\nThe hotel is situated directly in Times square. Smack dab in the middle of everything! It had plenty of coffee shops, gift shops, staff and restaurants, \r\nWould highly recommend it.'
5,'Amazing Quality','Just returned from my first trip to New York City with my girlfriend. Booked the day before we left on the Thursday and got a great deal through the Internet for the Crowne Plaza Times Square. Was initially concerned about the parking since I had never been before but was pleasently surprised that there was a large driveway tounload luggage and underground parking in the hotel. The parking is expensive ($80 for the weekend) but as I found out the same as everywhere esle. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful, probably the quickest check-in I\'ve ever had. The room was small but what we expected and it\'s not as if we spent much time in it anyway. That being said everything was spotless, bathroom, bed, everything. The cleaning staff leaves you a small card after they clean your linens with a weather forecast for the next day and a couple of ideas for sight-seeing, a really nice touch. The location is perfect, right on Times Square (hotel is on 49th and Broadway) so there is a lot of action as soon as you step outside but since we were on the 41st floor (something I requested as well as a non-smoking room) so when you do decide to shut it down for the night your high enough that it\'s very quite and peaceful. Had dinner on the Saturday in the hotelv restaurant and it was very good. Quick chech-out on Sunday and the trip flew by, highly recomend this hotel for anyone weather your trip be buisness or pleasure.'
5,'wonderful find!','We had never stayed at this location in New York City before and never even knew it was there. It was a wonderful location, the rooms were huge and the staff extremely friendly. A great find!'
2,'Overpriced, terrible service- many better options in NY','My boyfriend and I live in New York but decided to stay in this hotel to just celebrate our 2 yr anniversary. He travels a lot and is a diamond member so we get great treatment at Hyatts. All but this one...\r\nFirst off, the rooms are nothing to rave about and the bathrooms are tiny.\r\nOur key card refused to work despite having it fixed twice.\r\nThe snacks in the lounge are not good at all. This is the first time we have seen that you have to pay for alcohol in the lounge.\r\nThe front desk told us that breakfast was till 11 and when we stopped by at 10:20 nothing was available anymore.\r\nThe service is incredibly rude. This one lady at the front desk refused to talk to us because she thought we were not diamond members and when we told her we were she said Oh, someone will be with you shortly while she continued doing nothing. She did the same to the next person who got so mad he wanted to talk to her supervisor.\r\nOverall, for a tourist, this is a great location (and it has a nice gym), but honestly, for this price there are a lot of better hotels with great locations in New York. For someone looking for a special time, I would not recommend this hotel at all. Thanks Hyatt...my boyfriend tried to do something special for me and you ruined it.\r\nWhat a disappointment...'
4,centralissimo,'oltre alle caratteristiche normali assicurate dalla catena Hilton, voglio sottolineare come questo hotel si trova nel cuore del cuore di manhattan. 6a strada, 2 minuti dal moma, 2 minuti dalla 5a strada, 5 minuti dal rockfeller center, 2 minuti da radio city music hall, a 50 metri dallo zigfield theatre .... sconosciuto (a me ed a molti), importantissimo teatro dove spesso fanno le prime mondiali di molti spettacoli. ho avuto la fortuna (inaspettata) di assistere (anni fa, non nell\'ultimo viaggio) al red carpet per la presentazione mondiale di mamma mia ed ho stretto la mano alla Streep, a Brosnan (non ricordo se si scrive così, ma avete capito che è uno degli ultimi 007) .... beh .... non sono mai stato uno che ricerca i VIPs, ma sono rimasto colpito di quanto possa essere vero che certe cose possono succedere solo nella magica NYC.... e, nel mio caso, è stato un pochino anche merito dell\'Hilton e della sua posizione.'
4,'Tolle Lage','Das Marriott New York Marquis Times Square ist ein riesiger Hotel-Bunker in absoluter Top-Lage. Große, komfortable Zimmer mit Internet (gegen saftige Gebühr), Radio, Kabel- und Pay-TV sowie Klimaanlage sind Standard. Vor vier Jahren renoviert, überzeugt das 25 Jahre alte Haus mit seinen 49 Etagen vor allem durch seine Lage direkt am Time Square. Mehr Manhattan geht nicht. Die Zimmer sind sauber, geräumig, mit W LAN, TV und den üblichen Annehmlichkeiten ausgestattet. Dazu gehört auch ein Marmorbad. Klar gibt es Fitness-Einrichtungen und mehrere Restaurants. Doch wer bleibt bei dieser Lage schon im Hotel. Der Theaterdistrict, die unzähligen Geschäfte und jede Menge Restaurants sind doch in unmittelbarer Nähe. Theater-Karten besorgt der Concierge. Angenehm: Das Marriott ist ein Nichtraucherhotel. Zimmerpreis: ab 300 $. Und wer sein Auto parken lassen will, zahlt nochmal 55 $ pro Tag. Mein Tipp: Lieber auf den Leihwagen verzichten, den Hotelshuttle zum Flughafen und die Subway nutzen. Die Preise in diesem Marriott sind gesalzen, aber durch die extrem gute Lage irgendwo gerechtfertigt.'
4,'Nice Hotel With No Elevator Problems','What a nice hotel. We stayed three nights and found the hotel to in a great location. The employees of the hotel were very helpful and professional. The rooms were larger than other hotels we have stayed at in New York. The beds were very comfortable.\r\nGreat view of Times Square from the 8th floor lounge. Nice to watch the activities from this location. Be sure to go to the View and have dinner or drinks. Nice view of the city.\r\nWe experienced no problems with the elevators. There are always individuals that are going to complain and be impatient. Our longest wait was about 5 minutes and that was due to the number of individuals returning from Broadway plays.'
3,'Good location, okay amenities','Likes: Clean hotel, good location, just three short blocks from the center of Times Square. Room service food is very good. I do love the Westin Heavenly beds and slept fantastic the entire trip. Fitness center is clean and has enough equipment. Rooms are pretty spacious.\r\nDislikes: Hotel amenities are pretty basic. Spa is definitely not worth the price. The business center service is SO SLOOOOW. Hotel front desk, not very friendly. I really don\'t like the at your service line that you are supposed to call for everything -- half the time I called it rang and rang and rang and no one answered. I had to call twice for extra hangers (I waited over 6 hours the first time). I was in the room one morning working and had to tell the housekeeper twice to come back at a later time (I gave her the specific time both times she knocked) and when I finally left for the afternoon and came back late that night, the room had never been cleaned.'
5,'Great All Round','Great location, directly opposite Madison Square Garden, two minutes walk to Macys and about ten minutes walk up 7th Avenue to Times Square.\r\nThe one bedroom suite was massive, with enough room to fit in a lot more lounge furniture. Double bed settee in lounge area and Kingsize double in separate bedroom. Very well equipped kitchen.\r\nFrom past experience it\'s worth paying the extra for a suite, as NY hotel rooms can be a bit cramped for a family.'
5,'We loved it!','This hotel was really a treat for our trip. We stayed 4 nights in late October and had a fantastic stay. Check in was quick and easy, and we were given a standard king room on the 30th floor. The room wasn\'t anything huge, but definitely plenty of space. The hotel location was perfect, just a block from Times Square and all the action, which made it an easy walk whenever we wanted to eat, catch a subway (there is also a station right in front of the hotel), or go to a show. \r\nPros:\r\n-Location, location, location\r\n-Friendly staff\r\n-Comfortable bed\r\n-Nice LCD tv (With real HD, not stretched out)\r\n-Huge bathroom\r\nCons:\r\n-Very expensive room service\r\n-Some street noise from sirens\r\n-Pricey internet in the business center\r\nOverall we\'d definitely recommend the Westin Times Square, and would plan to stay there again on our next trip to New York.'
4,'Great Value for the Location!','This hotel is a great value for the perfect location. It\'s right by Times Square and central to most attractions. While it may not be as modern as some other hotels, it has a certain charm to it. No complaints about housekeeping and the whole staff was friendly.'
3,'Recent Stay','I was attending a real estate convention at christmas time so the hotel was full. the whole check in process as an issue, but this not why i am writing this review.\r\nMy service comment below is ONLY rated on the the executive lounge.....There are two ladies in the executive lounge that are outstanding, Mercedes and Kim. Both these ladies go out of their way to make you feel so welcome. With so many guest coming and going i was so surprise they singled me out towelcome me back! Kim on the front line keeping the food area well stocked and clean while Mercedes is cleaning up after everyone. Both do it with great pride, they should be commended.'
4,'Great, clean New York City hotel.','I had read some reviews before I stayed at this hotel and was a little leary. But I was so pleasantly surprised by the clean, clean room, bedding and bathroom. I couldn\'t be happier, as so many NYC hotels have been reporting bed bugs. Not here, this is a great, safe place to stay. We were on the 36th floor with a great view of the city. This hotel is so close to everything, you can walk anywhere. Nice choice of restaurants close too.'
3,'A Little disappointing','Looking forward to our first visit to the big apple so wanted to stay somewhere that generally delivers like. The Westin brand does. However very let down from the rudeness of the check in, to the room where light bulbs were out and not replaced over 4 days small room long wait for lifts and to top it off charged almost an extra 400.00 dollars on a advance purchase non refundable payment....... Reason given mis calculated ?'
3,'Muy buena ubicación','A pocos pasos de macys,al frente de madison square garden, las habitaciones bastantes regular, el precio si no es temporada alta no esta mal, es ubicación, ubicación, ubicación. Si no te interesa la comodidad pero si estar cerca de todo a buen precio entoces esta es la opción.'
5,'Service vs History','I work for a hotel, therefore I am partially biased when i stay at a hotel. The service was always friendly and extremely helpful. From the moment we walked in, there was a gentlemen that assisted us to the registration desk, the agent behind the front desk was attentive, polite and efficient. Check in process was fast and thorough, I think his name was Derrick.I fell in love with the hallway carpet on our floor and all the picture frames down the halls. I understand this hotel is Historic, therefore people should not expect modern and new walls/paint/wallpaper. I find these details in such a hotel, as character. Besides as little time we spent inside our room, it doesnt matter. The location of this hotel was perfect, we were able to catch the Blue Line up and down to wherever we needed to go. The hotel bar is centrally located which i found odd, but it was busy and such a nice lounge area to sit and take in the amazing ceiling of this property. Our waiter could have been a bit quicker, but it was busy so i didnt mind too much. Our room was nice, two double beds, great to sleep and two closets which is very helpful for TWO GIRLS! Our restroom was nice, i love the pictured frame of the peacock doors in black & White. Service was quick, we ordered a fan and within 5 minutes it was sent up and a call was made to make sure we received it, THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. Because i do work for a hotel, i value these details of the staff and how happy they were to be there and assist their guests. Great Training & Management!'
4,'Good location in Midtown','This hotel is gigantic and not the kind I would choose for myself normally. But this time it served my purposes, because of the walking distance to businesses I was visiting and very good subway connections. \r\nMy room was large enough, a pity they saved it on the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable. The one bad thing about the room was the air conditioning which was much too strong. The room was like a fridge, and this was in August! I had to turn it off at night. \r\nAnd the wifi in the room costs about $16, which I don\'t like. Free wifi in the lobby that works poorly, try Starbucks across the street instead.'
1,'Look elsewhere, don\'t waste your time!!','The website is VERY misleading. I chose this hotel for convienence to the train station and that is all it was, convienient. Upon entering the lobby you get the feeling that it is competive with other NYC hotels. But it is not. With 30 minutes in line for check in they could have had many more people working the front desk. Our room was on the 16th floor. Upon arrival to the floor is was the most dismal and eerie hallway. Apparently not ALL the rooms are renovated as advertised. We opened the door to flip on the light switch and found no lights....had to walk around in the dark to find a light and when we turned it on....wow....what an awful place to stay!! I immediately called down to have my room changed and was told that they were booked for the night....after the front desk just informed me that they were not full. When i questioned this I was told...my room type was booked for the night. 2 double beds. Talk about absolute bare bones. NOTHING on the walls, no pictures, NO mirror. It was just like a dorm room with not one ammenity. The bathroom was very old and the window stayed cracked at 2 inches. There were not enough towels to accomodate us so i called down for more towels and did not get what i had asked for. We were not in the room when they arrived and came back to find them thrown on the bed. The hallway was very noisy, The next day we were charged to have our luggage held in the cellar. After $340 for the room that was terrible you think they could have held our luggage for nothing. The luggage man informed us that the hotel was like a book that should never be judged from its cover. ALOT of misinformation from the website to the staff. Absolutely would NEVER stay in this hotel again for any reason.'
4,'Birthday Trip','The Hotel New Yorker is an old hotel with lots of character and history. We had a great time in New York and it was made extra special by the helpful staff at the Hotel New Yorker. Mohammed who greeted us on arrival at the reception desk was fantastic, very helpful he was aware that it was my wifes birthday having previously emailed the hotel. They organised a corner room overlooking the Empire State Building with some choclates even though the Hotel was full. They were quick to send items to our room even late at night such as tea & Coffee. The Concierge was honest about pricing. The hotel is clean and in good order and not a noisy hotel. They have a diner attached that is open 24 hours a day and serves good food. No swimming pool though. Access to the the main sites from the hotel is easy, either walking or the underground. There is a ticket booth in Time square that sells half price theatre tickets to most of the Broadway shows well worth a 20 minute wait. They have a transport desk that can organise a car to take you to the airport just watch the time of day as the traffic can be terrible. We went to a baseball game \'NY Mets\' that was great fun easy to get to, they run faster underground trains to the stadium and ticket prices start from $5 it is worth paying a bit more to sit behind the plate higher up in the stand.'
3,'Good location, okay hotel','Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights while on business in May 2007. This was my 5th trip to NY but the first time staying in this part of Manhattan. The best feature of this hotel is the location. Penn Station is located across the street and the Empire State Building, Macy\'s, and Times Square are all within walking distance.\r\nOverall the hotel is okay. First the positive - the staff is very friendly and you do get a sense they are concerned about tending to your needs. When I requested items such as toiletries or a pillow, they always followed up with a call to ensure the item had been delivered and was to my satisfaction. The room was large by New York standards, the bed was very comfortable and the Aveda products were a nice touch. \r\nOn the negative side - the hotel is in need of renovations. The carpet and walls in the hallways were filthy. Regulating the temperature in the room is difficult and I sometimes found myself resorting to opening a window only to deal with loud sirens from the fire station next door. The sheets on the bed were never changed during my stay, although the towels were replaced daily. The shower stall was extremely small - I\'m not a large person, about 115 pounds,\r\nbut the stall was so small that washing my hair often resulted in my elbows hitting the wall.\r\nOverall, it\'s not a bad property, just in need of some improvements.'
4,'Great location, great value, great place to stay for fun trip to NY','Stayed here for four nights with my wife and five kids ( 2 rooms). We had a very comfortable stay and a great trip. Good rooms, good TV, good shower, ,etc. All staff that we encountered were very professional and courteous. Great location - you can easily walk to time square, theaters, the plaza, central park, Lincoln center, Rockefeller center, grand central, etc. When it\'s time to take the subway (soho, Chinatown, wall street, etc.), there is a subway entrance right outside the hotel. Btw, the NY subway system is awesome and very easy to use/learn. Hotel also has a great fitness center with new treadmills, ellipticals, nautilus, and free weights. Recommend: Wicked, ruby foos, carmines, rosa Mexicano, top of the rock at night, the plaza, staten island ferry, soho, grand central station, Macy\'s on 34th, bloomingdales on 59th, lombardis on spring ST, patsy\'s on 60th, dylan\'s candy bar on 60th, time square at night, ST Patrick\'s cathedral (incredible), pastrami sandwich at Carnegie deli (right next to hotel)'
5,'Fantastic Hotel, Great Location','We have just returned from a 1 week stay in the New Yorker Hotel and I would like to say how much both myself and partner enjoyed our stay. After reading some of the reviews regarding the room size i was slightly worried, However upon arrival my fears were not founded. We were allocated room 21 51 and had fantastic views of the empire state building and the manhatten skyline. The room was spotless and remained that way by the great maid service. I found the room size to be fine, clean and modern..... can i just remind people you are in New York City space is a luxuary many don\'t have. \r\nAll the dealing we had with all hotel staff were very plesant, and we found them to be very helpful. \r\nWe were really surprised when we arrived that we were greated with a box of chocolates as we were celbrating our wedding anniversary.\r\nThe Location was fantastic, walking distance to most of the major attractions, if not subway at the side of the hotel or plenty of taxis outside he hotel 24 hrs a day......\r\nWe have already decided to re book for january..... please dont read the negitive reviews theis hotel is clean, modern rooms, and friendly staff in a faantastic location'
5,'Hotel made our stay in New York perfect.','We stayed 5 nights in the hotel paid for with reward points and had two rooms. As a gold card member our rooms were upgraded and were amazing. They were both on 30th floor and were newly refurbished, one was an enormous corner room which looked down onto Broadway and the lights between the two sides of the street. The other room was a regular sized room which was large enough for two double beds and a sofa. The view was stunning it looked towards the clock and police dept and because of its position you could see time square with nothing blocking the view and no.other tall buildings nearby it really was awesome (room 3035). We had free breakfast in the concieege lounge which included a good selection but was only available Mon - fri. We also ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant (expensive as you would expect but good food) and juniors (across the road) which was also good. We did not go to the view restaurant but the newly refurbed bar overlooking time sq was nice. Overall the stay was excellent the rooms were stunning and the hotel was big but nicely done. We stayed over the same weekend as hurricane Irene so the hotel was full and people had to stay in more than usual due to no subway and most shops restaurants and bars were closed. The hotel coped with this well and it did not feel overly busy especially considering its size. We had a fantastic time I would love to return.'
5,'Great base for Times Square and Broadway theaters','Great art deco hotel, 2 minutes walk to the half price ticket booth in Times Square. Rooms are comfortable, two big soft queen beds but a very small bathroom.\r\nVery busy, older clientele, not the place for young clubbers or partygoers.\r\nAdjoining Italian restaurant good for a meal after a show. Small diner attached which serves quick meals and s reasonably priced.\r\nCan be a little noisy from 47th street below, (we were on the 8th floor).\r\nOverall a good place to stay in New York if Broadway is your thing.'
4,'Great Location - Decent Hotel','We recently visited New York and spent 2 nights at the New Yorker Hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a massive check-in queue and only three members of staff checking in. When we did get to a member of staff, she was rude and chose to continue her conversation with a colleague in Spanish rather than help check us in. As soon as we did check in and headed for our rooms, the lift broke and the fire department had to be called. Seemed like things were going from bad to worse. Once this was sorted the management provided a pretty good service and were more than apologetic. We were situated on the 26th floor and the rooms were small. As it is New York this was to be expected. The rooms were clean and satisfactory. The main advantage of the hotel was its location, close to Macy\'s, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Buiding and only about 10 blocks from Times Square. I would suggest that our experience was probably not typical of a stay at the New Yorker but the size and quliaty of the rooms was probably indicative of 3-4 star hotels in NYC.'
4,'Great hotel - great location','We have stayed here 3 or 4 times and are returning again this year. Rooms large and clean and the location is brilliant. Close to central park and times square. Only negatives are the lifts are very busy and the large lounge bar seems to be rarely staffed, would be good to enjoy a mid-afternoon refreshement in there. Staff are helpful and friendly.\r\nWould be good to here from people who could recommend a good quality, reasonably priced alternative for a future visit. We like a midtown location.'
4,'Great location; glad I was expensing it for work','The lobby is a bit unconventional - an elevator trip is necessary to reach the check-in desk. But once you reach the lobby and figure out the elevator system (essentially you enter your floor and you\'re assigned an elevator), it\'s a nice hotel.\r\nThe location, right on Times Square, is convenient for Broadway shows although the area is very touristy. Tourists outnumber actual New Yorkers by a wide margin. \r\nMy 18th floor room was surprisingly quiet. I couldn\'t hear much noise from outside or other rooms. The bedding and bathrooms were standard Marriott - white comforter, marble vanity, etc. \r\nI ate at the sushi bar one night and found it enjoyable, although oddly empty. Drinks were expensive (my Cosmopolitan was around $14), but it\'s NYC so that\'s expected.\r\nMy room was about $300 (plus taxes) due to a conference group rate. Rack rate was closer to $600, which would not be worth it. As it was, I\'m glad my employer was picking up the tab for staying here. But not everyone felt that way as I saw lots of families on vacation here.'
5,'Our weekend at the Palmer House Hilton','Last weekend, we spent a fantastic 3 days at the Palmer House Hilton, Chicago! We were there for my nephew\'s wedding. Everything from the Bride\'s shower to the Sunday morning brunch was held there, with the exception of the rehersal dinner. It was unbelievable! We saw nothing but smiles from everyone on the staff, from the valet parking to the chef on Sunday morning! Even the women cleaning the rooms were an absolute delight! The rooms were clean and beautiful the wedding was a fairytale - decorations that took our breath away. The food at the reception was 2nd to none we\'ve ever had anywhere in the world and the wait staff was tremendous! Every single one of them was happy WE were there and they were happy to serve us. I can\'t stop talking about the friendly, exceptional people who call themselves PALMER HOUSE STAFF! Thank you all!'
5,Excelente,'Hotel excelente que está situado en pleno centro de NY.\r\nExcellent hotel which is located in the heart of NY.'
2,'Bien ubicado, para estar lo minimo','Esta muy bien ubicado, sobre la 7 y la 33. Enfrente de la Penn Stationy al Madison, a menos de una cuadra hay una estacion de subtes ( aca se puede tomar un subte que te deja a dos cuadras del zoo del Bronx) , a muy pocas cuadras del Empire State y de los teatros de Broadway y de B&H, casi pegado a Macy\'s. \r\nLa atencion no es muy buena y el servicio tampoco.\r\nDespues del check in, fui a mi habitacion y me encontre que ya habia alguien adentro, me dieron otra sin disculparse. Cuando ingrese a mi nueva habitacion, me encontre con el TV encendido y un Celular cargandose sobre una mesa, al rato entro una mucama, sin pedir permiso y se llevo el celular....\r\nEs un hotel bastante viejo y con poco manteniemiento, y con mucho trafico de clientes. Como dije para estar lo minimo, dormir e irse. No es tan barato, teniendo en cuenta lo que es...'
3,'Suficiente pelado','si buscas algo solo para dormir, este es tu hotel.\r\nojo si mides 187 cms. como yo te costará ducharte.\r\npero es fantastica su ubicacion'
5,'Consistently terrific.','We made several trips to NYC over past few months and stayed at this hotel on 3 occasions. The location is exceptional. Our room was always spotless. We like the corner rooms which have walls of windows on 2 sides making the views beautiful. Rooms are spotless and large. The beds are heavenly. It\'s convenient to Times Square and various attractions. I highly recommend.'
4,'Clean and Centrally Located','The hotel room was very tiny--by far the tiniest hotel room I have ever stayed in--but clean and of modern decor. We received a special rate through AAA of $140 a night (including taxes), which I thought was quite high, but apparantly not by NYC standards! My girlfriend and I visited NYC to enjoy the Broadway shows (which were fabulous!) and to take in all the sights and sounds (visit dates - August 19 - 24, 2004). We had a wonderful visit! We were put into a hotel room with two twin beds...the room was so small that I could not open my suitcase on the floor...I had to put it on my bed to open it. However, the room was very clean and quiet. We asked for a room on a higher floor (10th floor), and you could not hear any traffic noise or other guests. The elevators are very FAST, due to a recent renovation, taking literally seconds to go from the lobby to the 10th floor. The hotel staff was friendly enough, and the hotel is within walking distance to EVERYTHING. Three Broadway theatres are right next to the hotel. If you want tickets for a show, go to the TKTS tent in Times Square, which is just a block away. The first night, we checked into our room around 7:20 PM; went to the TKTS tent and bought tickets at 50\% off for Beauty and the Beast, then went to the 8 PM show! (It was playing in the theatre next door to the hotel). Lots of restaurants, nightclubs and bars near the hotel. We walked everywhere...we did not even need a taxi. I would definitely stay at the Edison again. I much prefer it to the cold, sterile environments of the nearby Marriott and the Hilton Times Square. The little coffee shop at the Edison is delightful! It is the hotel\'s former ballroom, and has a domed ceiling and what appears to be original artwork. We had a delicious and very reasonable breakfast in the little cafe, which was cozy and beautiful. The front desk has a safe for travelers cheques, money and other valuables. We felt quite safe and welcomed in New York. The people were very friendly and accommodating, and we felt safe walking everywhere, even at night.'
1,'You can do much, much better in New York','Pros: Groovy environment (an Ian Schrager retrofit of a Holiday Inn, done about 10 years ago, and the Holiday-Inn residue remains, barely disguised by purposefully low illumination--it\'s barely possible to read anything in the public spaces). Pseudo-hip place to meet up with your pals for a drink, etc. Convenient location.\r\nCons: Horrible room (a Standard Queen), barely big enough for the bed--you had to kind of lean over the bed in order to walk around it, being careful not to smack your head into the wall-mounted TV. Barely OK for one person maybe, though would feel like a prison cell, but terrible for two. Skip bringing a suitcase, there is nowhere to put it. (Fortunately, we just had a small overnight bag each, which we stuffed in the tiny closet.) The bathroom is tiny, which is OK, but it has a window into the room, and a chiffon curtain, which meant that if you turned the light on in the bathroom, you would wake the other person as the light would shine through onto the bed. No frills whatsover. Light from corridor shone through into room through crack between door and wall from floor to ceiling. Very noisy (woken by drunken guests coming home at 4am, shouting in the corridor, just a few feet from our bed.) Service is hit or miss, mostly miss: Long lines at Check-in, long lines for Concierge (who seemed very inefficient, devoting 20 mins to one customer, telling him all about all the restaurants in the whole of NY it seemed, while many others were waiting in line with quick questions). Forget about calling the Front Desk from your phone in the room--they never answer it. All of this for $335 a night (including taxes). We would never have chosen this hotel--it was booked for us by our host. I\'ve stayed in many hotels in New York over the last 25 years, in a wide range of price points, and this was by far the absolute worst in terms of quality of comfort, service, and sleep. You can do much, much better in New York.'
3,'meglio del previsto','Comincio col dire che le critiche all\'hotel che avevo letto su tripadvisor si sono rivelate tutte vere: stanza microscopica (impossibile tenere aperta non due ma anche una sola valigia grande), bagno piccolino e vetusto, moquette dal colore indefinito,mancanza di cassaforte e frigo bar in camera, reception poco disponibile, e personale addetto al controllo nella hall che chiacchiera per i fatti suoi...troppi difetti per il prezzo e per avere un Molto Buono Tripadvisor, titolo di cui l\'hotel si fregia mettendolo in bella mostra. Tuttavia, oltre alla posizione davvero eccezionale e alla vista (fatevi dare una camera sopra il 30° piano) , ho scoperto alcune qualita\' che meritano di essere segnalate: la climatizzazione era regolabile dalla camera, e funzionava bene, il letto comodissimo grazie a un supermaterasso a molle nuovo (e pulito, controllo sempre), il servizio in camera piu\' che accettabile, la stanza silenziosa. Inoltre, i due ristoranti aperti 24 ore e collegati dall\'interno sono un vantaggio enorme, sia per quando e\' tardi e si e\' troppo stanchi per girare, sia se succede di beccare Sandy...a tal proposito, l\'hotel ha gestito in maniera eccellente questa emergenza, con avvisi scritti, offrendoci di dormire al 2 piano e verificando comunque che avessimo chiuso le finestre...'
5,'just heavenly!!!','We came to new york for our anniversary. We stayed for 6 nights. I hated to leave. Check in was fast. The room was huge, very clean and the view was great. We stayed on the 42nd floor in a king deluxe. The staff was very helpful. I would recommend this hotel. We are going back in september and will stay there again. No complaints at all.'
5,'Brilliant hotel in the heart of the action!!','We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Westin. It was our first Christmas away from family, and the hotel was absolutely perfect!! I had never visited NY before and wanted to be in the middle of the city, seeing the hustle and bustle of it all, I don\'t think that I would suggest to my parent\'s to stay here as it is a little hectic, but for us it was perfect. Easy to get to all the attractions either by taxi or subway, which is right across the way from the hotel.\r\nThe room was spacious, the beds were most definitely heavenly and the bathroom was very clean. My only complaint would be the bath, I love my baths but the one in the hotel was definitely not designed for a long relaxing soak in the basic rooms. Room service was quick and delicious and fairly reasonable too.\r\nStaff were always very friendly, and the concierge always provided advice for where to go and eat, we had breakfast in the hotel one morning, but with so many dinners around I preferred eating out and getting a feel for the city. For anyone\'s first time, or 20th time, this is a great hotel.'
5,'Great location','We were spending one day/night in New York and our key criteria for a hotel was cost, location and cleanliness and the New Yorker met all three of those requirements. The staff was helpful, though at times it did seem a little forced, but overall our stay was great.\r\nThe guest room was perfect for what we needed, a big (comfy) bed, clean bathroom and quite, which we though we would not have in the middle of the city.\r\nLocation wise this hotel was phenomenal, just a quick walk from Grand Central station, Times Square and Madison Square Garden... anywhere past those three was a quick subway ride away'
4,'Huge rooms and convenient location!','I spent a night here because my company was holding a seminar in the building next door. I was pleasantly surprised by the lovely lobby area, the friendly staff, and the huge (well, at least by Manhattan standards) room. The room was quiet and well-appointed, and the bed was super comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.'
5,'A touch of class!!','Having stayed on a room only basis over the Christmas period, my wife and I consider this hotel excellent value for money. Considering the amount of people arriving constantly throughout our stay the hotel staff and room service was exceptional. Ignore the reviews critising the lifts they were no problem, we stayed on the 35th floor and never waited any longer than 5 minutes. The beds in the rooms have to be seen to be believed, being 6ft4in i managed to lose my wife on several occasions! Overall a great stay and we will return soon.'
4,'Amazing Service, solid hotel','I have to say, my check in at the Marriott Marquis was excellent. Eduardo, the gentleman that checked me in was the friendliest and most accommodating front desk person I\'ve ever dealt with. I explained to him my irrational fear of heights and he put me on one of the lowest floors. Because of my gold status with Marriott, I was eligible to go in the club room. But, that being on a high floor as well, he just gave me free breakfast both days of my stay and upgraded my room. \r\nThe room itself was nice with a great view of Times Square. Surprisingly quiet considering the hustle and bustle of the location. The Internet, going along with an unfortunate trend of hotels these days, was spotty at best. I rated the value as poor only because I don\'t think any hotel room is worth $449 a night be it Tines Square, Vegas or wherever. But that is more my personal opinion and not a reflection of the room itself. Good hotel with a great staff.'
5,'Hotel = Fine / Price = Good / Location = Great','My girlfriend and I came up to New York to see The Gates in Central Park, (that should date this review), and the musical Hairspray. Through Priceline we got two rooms for $107 per person per night. We checked in early at 3:30 PM. She had a smoking room and I had a non-smoking room. \r\nStaff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and contained all the basic amenities, (desk with data-port, (Wi-Fi was available for $10 a day), iron and ironing board, free in-room safe and of course a small TV.)\r\nHer air-conditioner was missing a knob, my shower handle came off in my hand. If this is the sort of thing that simply ruins your vacation, (I paid $100 for this room, how DARE they!), then this may not be the place for you. Other than these quirks, (and the slow elevators), we were delighted with the hotel. \r\nWe walked out the front door and looked to the left to see Central Park then looked to the right to see billboards of Times Square (about a 1/2 mile away.) We walked everywhere because everything was so close. When we did take cabs (if our feet were sore or she was wearing high heels) we were usually no more than $5 from where we wanted to go. The hotel is also conveniently located next to the 57th street exit of the Q, N, R & W subway lines.\r\nWe asked the very friendly concierge, (guests kept coming by to thank him for his help or recommendation), about a comedy club and he gave us VIP tickets to The Laugh Factory. The tickets got us to the front of the line and first choice of seating. (I felt guilty walking past about 50 people but my girlfriend loved it.)\r\nWe both agreed that we would recommend this hotel. We give the hotel Above average for the rooms and price but bump it up to Excellent because of the location.'
4,'Fantastic Location','The location of this hotel was fantastic, right in the middle of everyhting and only a shore walk to Time Square, Cnetral Park and lots more. One block from 5th Avenue. It is an extremely busy hotel, the lobby was one of the busiest I have ever known. We had an Executive Suite on the 43rd floor. Room was very big with lots of storage. Our daughter had a fold away bed in the lounge which was quite comfortable if a bit squeaky!Downside was the bathroon which was very small but the shower was very good. Staff were very polite and friednly. As we were on the Execuitve level, we had a complimentary continental breakfast which set us up for the day. As it was such a busy hotel, there was sometimes a wait for a taxi but you could always walk to the street and hail one if you prefer. Would certainly stay here again.'
2,'What a disappointment....','I\'ve stayed at this hotel for about 7 years as its location is great - right on Times Square, but alas, its reached its end... Reservation messed up, room I wanted wasnt available and on and on... The atrium is right above the bar/lounge and the restaurants.. so in the morning you get the smell of ham and eggs permeating under your door, and at night you get the bar noise thru the door. \r\nIts a real shame that Marriott hasnt updated the hotel other than the elevators, and has taught its desk staff some customer service skills other than \'I\'m sorry... but.. policy is policy... Housekeeping wasnt great either with scum in the bathtub and general attention to cleanliness and timeliness...\r\nSorry to say, but I\'m recommending either the Westin or W for next year\'s conference.. Goodbye Marquis...'
3,'Great location, hotel with character','This was our fourth time in NYC but first time in the Edison, we travelled with my husband\'s daughter and two teenage sons (for their first trip, but not their last!) so had requested one double and one triple room.\r\nThe rooms were great the triple room had two double beds and was very roomy they were very happy with the room. Ours was a bit smaller with a double bed, t.v. and small built in wardrobe, but sufficient for us. Both rooms were clean and we had clean towels every day. We didn\'t mind that our room was a bit smaller, as we only use the room to shower and sleep it\'s not as if you go to NYC to stay in your room!\r\nThe hotel as a whole was great, it\'s older but full of character and staff wer helpful and friendly.\r\nLocation for the hotel was great for Times Square and our breakfast place which we found on our last trip was only a block away. If you want a great breakfast go to the Olympic Diner on 8th Ave just passed 48th Steet, the staff are friendly, efficient and the breakfasts great. I had 2 eggs, fried potatoes and two slices of toast, orange juice and coffee (which they refill free!) all for $5.10, there\'s a great choice whether your a meat eater or not (which we aren\'t).\r\nWe also went to the Scarlatto Restaurant which is a few doors down from the hotel, the food was fabulous we couldn\'t fault anything, the service and atmosphere was great.\r\nOverall we all had a great time and would definately stay at this hotel again. Our rooms were on the 15th floor 1526 triple and 1526 double.'
5,'Great 9 nights spent, great location and friendly staff.','Stayed in this hotel for 9 nights and after staying in several others I must say it was an enjoyable stay. The location is perfect just 2 blocks off Central Park on 7th avenue. The room was nice and spacious and was clean. The staff were particularly friendly and went out of their way on occasions more so Ricky ( Ricardo Alvarez) in reception. I would recommend this to anyone staying in NY, it\'s good value.'

5,'Brilliant hotel in an awesome location','We (Self, wife and two kids ages 18 and 10) stayed at the Marriott Marquis from 22nd -26th Jun 2012 and then again from 12th - 14th Jul 2012. Both the times the experience was incredible. Right from the smooth check in at the lobby on the 8th floor to the nice spacious corner executive room everything was perfect. The highlight of the hotel is the location - right in the heart of times square. The staff was extremely curteous and helpful at all time. The only small drawback was that they permit wi fi access to only two devices so the four of us were playing musical chairs with the wi fi. The fitness centre is quite nice and well frequented. All in all a memorable stay and we would definitely stay at the Marriott whenever we are in New York again'
5,'Amazing value','I always stay at this hotel when I am in NYC. I LOVE how big the rooms are (a rarity in Manhattan), the location is prime (right next to Central Park) and the staff are extremely accommodating and kind. Plus the prices are always relatively low. I have no complaints.'
5,'art deco hotel','This hotel is a gem ,friendly staff,Clean rooms,fantastic diner and chic restaurant.\r\nit is only 1 block from maceys ,10 mins from time square,would highly recommend this hotel'
4,'Over priced but barely any flaws!','Me and a friend stayed here for 10 days in August 2009 (i couldnt select 2009 from the drop down above) anyway, we got to the hotel, and approached the desk - the clerk asked for the debit card i booked with, i told her that i will be paid from work on the Wednesday (we arrived on the Sunday) but no, she said they needed to hold the money which i can understand, but we were british and were hardly going to do a runner. So, we couldnt check in (and she had no words of wisdom or no helpful advice!!) \r\nEnded up having to pay for a phonecard to ring home - called my dad who had to go through the palarva (excuse the spelling) of scanning his credit card and drivers license over to the hotel via email so my dad had to foot the bill & me pay him back.\r\nFINALLY got into our room - was very spacious and clean, brilliant sized bathroom and they had a safe!! The TV was at the end of the bed and we were able to watch Family Guy and Criminal Minds (my 2 fave shows) \r\nBathroom had a large sink, a bath & shower and a wall length mirror above the sink - there was also a mirror on the bathroom door which helped me get up close to do my eye make up!\r\nWe had an issue with the coffee pot - it was in the bathroom (electrics & water do not mix) me, being British had no clue how to work the coffee pot, i managed to spill water and coffee in the bathroom and was too scared to turn off the electrics so we ran to reception and asked for help. They swiftly sent up a maintenance man who sorted it out within seconds and a fantastic maid who replaced our coffee and condiments and who also we had to force her to take our tip. She was amazing!!\r\nWas a club opposite the hotel - didnt hear a peep from it though. No smoking in the rooms either, it was a long trip from the room down to outside for a cigarette oh and the lifts are rather confusing - odds and evens more or less!! When we stayed there, there was scaffolding all around it, didnt bother me, i was hardly there.\r\nLocation wise it was good - subway right on the corner - took us to statue of liberty and Soho. Round the corner from Carniege Hall and we walked it to 5th ave and Madison, however, we made the mistake of walking to find Forever 21 & ended up by Macy\'s (Macy\'s was like lower down manhattan!) \r\nOn our 2nd day we walked to Natural History Museum - we took the route past Columbus circle and straight down past Central Park (i had to stop on the way back to gawp at the Dakota building - amazing!) Central Park itself is HUGE, we couldnt get around it, so we went to Whole Foods at Columbus Circle and picked up sushi and sat in the park to rest our feet. \r\nYou can also buy a metro card and i think its for 5 days (i forgot, dont quote me) on the subway which is soooo worth it, get one on the first day!! \r\nI have relatives who live in Lower East, we took a cab there, cost next to nothing!\r\nAll in all, i love New York City, if i had the money, i\'d move there. Amazing city, amazing people and amazing food (Ray\'s pizza!!!)'
4,'Location Location Location','Location is everything in this 4 star hotel. You are walking distance to many attractions. Time Square never sleeps. Very clean, big, modern and comfortable room. Although the carpet is a little run down. Bathroom is first class.\r\nBecause of its location, tight security at night time where you have to show your room key to go up to the hotel. Feel very safe. \r\nGym in 15th floor is wonderful to use.\r\nLobby restaurant offers $30 fixed menu for a 3 course dinner- great value!'
2,DARK,'Very trendy hotel, almost too cool for it\'s own good! Our double twin room was ok size-wise, but no storage for clothes, no wardrobe or chest of drawers meant living out of a suitcase. And why does it have to be SO DARK?? All the lighting is so dim it\'s impossible to see to get dressed at night, you have to be careful walking around because you can\'t see your feet!\r\nPosition is excellent for 5th Avenue shopping, Central Park etc.\r\nMy 19 year-old daughter loved it and didn\'t mind the above inconveniences. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would love to visit New York again but would probably not stay here.'
4,'We booked for 8 nights and stayed for a further 9','The Penn is so large that I expect the range of rooms and their conditions is broad. We booked and paid in advance over the internet for a standard room. We had read about long check in queues but we waited only 10 minutes. The pleasant woman who dealt with us on our arrival said I\'m going to give you an upgrade - now let me find you something nice. She allocated us a large room (we had just been in Paris in tiny rooms) with a King size bed on the 11th floor facing 7th Ave. It was clean, there was nothing broken, the sheets (green in colour and a bit old) were changed each day and fresh linen was provided daily. The A/C worked and was adjustable and was not noisy. There was a quiet fridge and a standard hotel hair dryer. Unlike many hotels there was no plumbing noise and we didn\'t hear other guests toilets flushing or them showering. The room looked just like the one in the photos on the website. Because the room faced 7th Ave the noise managed to penetrate the double glazing. This was our only complaint - but we were in NY - a busy, 24hr non stop metropolis - and we enjoyed being in the middle of it. We are pretty self sufficient but when we needed help we received courteous and accurate advice from the staff including a recommendation for a great Italian place to eat and tips on how to navigate Penn Station to avoid the stairs. The coffee shop downstairs sold pretty good coffee (we didn\'t think much of the coffee in NY).\r\nNearing the end of our booked stay we went and inquired about staying another 9 days (because we were really enjoying NY) on the basis that we wanted to stay in the same room. We were advised to use the internet to do this as the room rate would be better. We went to the Hotel\'s internet cafe, which I thought was pretty pricey, paid for a standard room then took the booking sheet back to the counter and they arranged for us to stay on in our same room - which had been upgraded from standard when we first arrived. When we checked out we used the luggage room in the basement and the staff there were terrific. They have a funny system where you can\'t pay for luggage storage with the Bell Captain you have to go to the main desk and line up - which was a bit annoying as we had just come away from the desk, but it only took a few minutes. In the 17 days we did see some longish queues at the desk and I expect people may have waited up to half an hour to check in - but we never waited more than 10 minutes on the 4 occasions we had to line up. We don\'t have anything bad to say about the hotel other than they seem to have a battle keeping the traffic noise out - but I suspect that would be the same for any hotel on a busy street in NY. \r\nI guess you might think that we have low standards given I haven\'t been complaining like the other reviewers; but be assured that isn\'t the case. Yes the Penn is a bit tired and it is very very large and you can feel invisible/insignificant and it doesn\'t feel personal\' but it is in a great location and it is reasonably priced for NY. Our experience was good and I would recommend the hotel to our friends - most of whom are likely to be out all day and half the night enjoying the city just like we were. It is possible to stay at the Penn and be satisfied.'
4,ottimo,'abbiamo soggiornato per una settimana.\r\nall\'arrivo sono stati molto cortesi peccato il blocco di 280$ sulla carta a garanzia (visto che il soggiorno l\'avevamo già pagato mi sembra un po\' eccessivo).\r\nle camere sono piccoline (noi avevamo una standard) ma dotate di ogni comfort, arredamento nuovo e piacevole, bagno piccolo ma nuovo e con una delle migliori docce che abbiamo trovato).\r\nnoi avevamo una camera al 18° piano fronte strada e non era molto rumosa (a parte sirene dei pompieri), meglio di quelle vicino all\'ascensore in cui c\'è un via vai continuo.\r\nil risto dell\'hotel è caro ma fashion e molto frequentato anche dai newyorkesi (50$ per una colazione americana a buffet, buona e abbondante ma l\'abbiamo fatta una volta sola), cmq nelle vicinanze non mancano posti per fare colazione tipo sturbucks (di fronte) o sbarro (1 isolato). la posizione è ottima, di fronte alla penn station per la metro e a 10 min a piedi da times square.\r\nse non si vuole spendere una follia ma si vuole cmq essere centrali e in un hotel carino questo è un buon compromesso'
5,'Our room was so quiet u wouldn\'t believe u were in times sq!!','We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 4 nights last month. This is my 6th trip to New York and the 1st time I have stayed in this hotel (xmas 2004 I stayed in the Westin). We were allocated a room on the 42nd floor , called The sleep zone , it certainly lived up to its name. Views were of the Hudson river and we were tucked away around the back of the hotel . Evenings were bliss, quiet!!! No noise from the nearby lifts or anything. The bed was the most comfortable I have stayed in whilst staying in the big apple. I will be the first to admit the room was a little on the small side , however all the extra luxuries made up for this , an eye patch to blcok out any light , ear plugs (not that i needed them) a cd of relaxing tunes in case you did have trouble sleeping and a lavender linen spray to make your bed lined smell good. They accomodated an extra late check out for us with no worries at all even though the hotel was really busy . \r\nLocation can not been beaten . Highly recommended. p/s I am a priority club member (free to join) don\'t know if this made any difference with the room I was allocated. Will be staying here in future'
5,'Will be back again','Michelle & Milha wonderful & excellent professional. They made us feel welcome. We are here for upcoming wedding & hooneymoon they extra special. \r\nEveryone at the hotel are very help.\r\nLocation is great. You can walk every where from the hotel location. \r\nWe will be back to stay again.'
5,'Perfect Location!','The location is tremendous--right in the heart of everything and within walking distance to subways, bus lines, plays; Mama Mia, Wicked, MTV, etc.and cabs at your beck and call outside the hotel. The corner rooms are larger and comfortable enough for 4 girls sharing a room. The view from this room is also incredible. The Concierge service was extremely friendly, made us dinner reservations, passes to elite dance clubs, and got us theatre tickets for sold out plays...Would definitely want to stay there again!'
5,'Architettonicamente straordinario e ottime stanze nel centro di Wind City','Situato di fronte al millenmium Park e nel centro del Loop di Chicago. Dal Palmer House si possono raggiungere i principali luoghi di interesse del centro Città (Magnificient Mile, Hanckook Tower, Cloud Gate,...)\r\nLa hall è di una bellezza quasi straordinaria per gli standar Statunitensi. Le stanze rispecchiano il tipico look pulito e classico delle garandi catene Anglossasoni.\r\nConsigliato sicuramente. Inoltre talvolta si trovano offerte davvero impensabili.'
3,'Location, Location, Location!','We\'ve got mixed reviews about the Hudson. The location, for us, was perfect. Located right near the southwest corner of Central Park and Columbus Circle, we were within easy walking distance from many of the tourist attractions that New York has to offer. Plus, the subway, with multiple lines, was only one block away. We stayed in their next to cheapest room and we were aware that the room would be small. If you are a larger person, pay for the bigger rooms as the bathroom, especially, was tiny. We stayed for 7 nights. The rooms were clean and air conditioned, the bed comfortable, and we had no complaints in this area. However, the elevators were slow and iffy, our safe deposit box didn\'t work (we called about this our first day and were told that the battery needed to be replaced...it never was); the ice machine on our floor didn\'t work and were told by house keeping that it had been that way for more than a week. Food and beverages were expensive. Wi-fi cost $10.00/night unless you went to the Sky Terrace and signed in from there each day. The decor was trendy but a bit dark in the corridors. The staff was friendly and helpful but the bartender in the Sky Terrace was not adept in making cocktails...one tasted like watered-down kool-aid ( at $16.00/cocktail it was disappointing but we were offered a free drink afterwards). Would we stay there again? Yes, the price for the room was right and the location made up for any negatives.'
4,'Si...ma con qualche no!!!','Hotel dalla posizione eccellente ,vicinissimo a Central Park e a due passi da Times Square.\r\nOttima la pulizia delle camere ,qualche nota negativa riguardo l\'organizzazione.....arrivati in hotel all\'ora di cena dopo un volo intercontinentale la camera a noi assegnata era ancora come i precedenti clienti l\'avevano lasciata.....Letto e bagno!!!!!\r\nInoltre non trovo corretto nei confronti del cliente...far pagare 3,5$ a bagaglio per la custodia il giorno del cech out (la camera va liberata entro le 10 del mattino) e normalmente i voli partono quasi sempre alla sera tardi.'
2,'That lobby is deceiving!','One of the Pennsylvania\'s biggest problems in my opinion is the staff. Firstly the hotel is very understaffed and the skeletal staff that they do have are very rude (front desk), very loud (maids) and just not very helpful. After asking 4 different members of staff if there was a toilet in the lobby I gave up as each gave different directions. Waiting for someone to come and open your safety deposit box was a joke. \r\nThe line to check in is ridiculous. When we eventually checked in and got upstairs we found our card key would not work, after using three different keys and going up and down to the lobby three different times and as anyone who has stayed there will know is a chore in itself we eventually go into our room, (boy is that lobby deceiving). I think we had it quite lucky at the Hotel Penn after reading some of the other reviews. Our room didn\'t smell although it was badly in need of a good hoovering and polishing.\r\nThe location is great can\'t fault that but the hotel itself is in bad need of a makeover, staff and decor.\r\nIt seems it\'s the luck of the draw when you stay at the Pennsylvania. Just dont complain if your lucks not in!!!'
4,'Nice Hotel','We stay this Christmas in NYC, the hotel was really good, best of all is the location is close to everything. The staff is OK, have stayed in cheaper hotels with better concierge service. I recommended this hotel.'
2,'Fantastic Location','our first visit to the states and it was great. the hotel was very grand, but our room was dark and very noisy due to the air conditioning vents being outside our window. also the electrics are very doggywatch out for the loose sockets in the BATHROOM. the stairs were dark and dirty, and no direction signs. the lobby is spectacular very glittsy. the breakfast cafe was very good and prices were ok. we would recommend this hotel but check your room before the bell boy leaves you. LAWSON TAYLOR &FAMILY.'
1,'No way!','This is the worst experience ever!\r\nWe spent 3 nights in this terrible hotel.. everything from outside was nice, good flags, good bulding, excellent location(just few blocks from TImes Square) but..\r\nINSIDE:..The room was poor and dark, no fornitures just a small desk,No wi fi included on the rate,No breakfast included,They didn\'t make our room on our second day!!\r\nThe Bathroom was absolutely 2 stars hotel and not 4 and at least\r\nthey have a confy bed but there was a rod sticking out from under the bed who hurt my foot.\r\nAnyone told us hello, how are you, did you enjoy your stay with us and this is a 4 star Hotel?? No way!'
5,'Fantastic Hotel in Chicago','My friend and i stayed at this Hotel for 4 nights in August. We arrived into O\'Hare Airport and hopped on the L Train for 40 mins approx to Monroe. The hotel was just around the corner from the L stop, very convenient. We were given a room on the 18th floor. The room was a great size with 2 very comfortable double beds and 2 bathrooms. The hotel is just a 5 min stroll to nearby Grant Park. The Bike n Roll and Segways are only a 10 min walk away from the hotel. There is a bus stop right at the corner on the Grant Park side that will bring you along Michigan Avenue.\r\nThe only negative we experienced with this hotel was the fact that they charged my friend\'s credit card twice for the cost of the room...most annoying when we were traveling to 3 more States within the US. Numerous phone calls and unnecessary time spent on hold being transferred from one department to another, the mess finally got sorted. This is something that easily could have gone unnoticed, thankfully my friend was careful at checking the charges to her credit card. It took 3 days to rectify this problem. Too long really.'
4,'Great Location - Good Hotel','Got a decent deal for booking the hotel early and arrived after the renovations had completed - so our room was nice and new not 5star new, but we had a big enough room and bathroom for our 4night stay. Beds were comfortable, coffee/tea making facilities were great!\r\nI\'ve read other reviews saying that the street noises could be heard from the room - this is true - but I guess NYC is 24/7 so this is to be expected, it didnt impact our stay at all.\r\nWe drank cocktails and had nibbles at Niles bar, which is attached to the hotel; cracking little cockatil bar, good atmosphere and great cocktails.\r\nAll staff in hotel were spot on - would happily stay here again!'
1,'Hudson hotel smells','We go to NewYork all the time. We stayed at the Hudson at 356 West 58th Street.\r\nThe hotel looked pretty good at their website. Stylish and good location. But when we pulled in there was no Valet parking at front. They told us that , we could left our car the valet guy would come and take our car! There was not even one guy waiting at front.\r\nAnyway we went inside and the lobby restaurant and the lounge areas looked stylish, Phillipe Stark design. When we went to our room, we were almost gonna die. It was such a small room and the way it was designed it was a waste with Stark\'s useless decorative items and there was absolutely no room for anything to move around. For sure Philippe Stark does not have any clue what a hotel room needs for design!!!He may be good for restaurant and lounge design but not for a hotel room. \r\nAnyway we complained , the staff was so nice they changed our room and gave us a bigger room. The room was bigger but there was a bad smell inside. When we get into the bed even the sheets were smelling like cigarette! We called front desk and told them that we wanted a Non smoking room. The answer was it was a nonsmoking room. We really did not belive them and have them change the sheets. It really did not help! Than we found out that the hotel did not have a good ventilation system and it was smelling all over the place!\r\nWe also could hear everthing the next door was doing, even when they rolled the toilet paper we were hearring! Everytime we moved in the bed, the bed squeaked like a dormatory room. We called front desk and told them that we wish to because we commited for one night but we could cancel the rest of our reservation, \r\nwe said fine,We stayed there for one night and Ran Out of that smelling uncomfortable hotel next day.\r\nAllthough! the staff was nice. \r\nIf you want to be near the Central park west, the location was good.\r\nWe went to Millenium Bradway Premiere at Times Square. what a big difference a hotel can make for your trip. It was quality and confortable.'
1,'It\'s haunted. Enough said.','Yep, it\'s haunted. Something was moving around our room while we slept. If it wasn\'t a ghost then it was a mouse or cockroach. Either way I\'m not going back. \r\nThe room was dirty and tired, the bathroom was probably the original one from when it was built and there were power sockets literally hanging off the wall.\r\nThe only good point is the central location, but I won\'t be going back. \r\n(The movement stopped after a day or two which suggest the ghosts and vermin don\'t approve of it either).'
4,'très bien situé pour faire du shopping','La chambre est assez spacieuse pour 3 adultes, certe la salle de bain est un peu petite mais l\'emplacement de l\'hôtel est idéal : 10 mn de Time Squart, 5 mn de Macy\'s et la station de métro est au pied de l\'hôtel'
3,'Just fine','Location is right across from Penn Station, if convenience is what you want. But get on a higher floor, because 7th ave right there is noisy all times of the day and night. \r\nFine hotel for the price in Manhattan. Rooms were a bit small, and the elevators sometimes were slow. There was some construction going on, which is good - because it needs a refurb. Gym was small, but I think this was temporary because of the construction. Shower was great. Everything was clean.'
5,'Had a Great Time at the Marriott Marquis!','We stayed here for one night in August with our 12 year old niece and had a great time!\r\nWe arrived around 10:30 and they had a room available for us immediately. I requested a Times Square view and was happily accomodated. The staff was very pleasant upon every encounter. The elevator system was great and SUPERFAST....we never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. \r\nThe room was nice.......clean, roomy and comfortable. We often stay in NYC and this room was a decent size by NYC standards. The view was great! The bathroom was large and clean.\r\nThe location was great for what we wanted to accomplish (show a 12 year old a good time!). It\'s right in the middle of the action.....Virgin Megastore, MTV studio and many, many theaters within easy walking distance. Yes, this hotel IS surrounded by lights and people.......it\'s in TIMES SQUARE (in prime tourist season might I add!)!!!! \r\nYes, things are not cheap at the Marriott Marquis.......water, room service, Starbucks, etc.. But being that they are located in one of the top tourist meccas in the world, they can get away with it. It\'s like expecting things at Disney World to be cheap! If you need water and are not willing to pay the price at the hotel, there are hundreds of places just footsteps away that will happily accomodate you! But really, after paying $349/night for the room, what\'s another $7 for water??\r\nWe typically do not stay in Times Square when we come, but would stay here again!'
4,'Top-Lage, knurriges Personal','Zu Beginn einer 14-tägigen USA-Rundreise haben wir uns für drei Nächte im Crowne Plaza Times Square eingemietet. Gekostet hat das nichts, durch die tolle Aktion Biggest Free Night Offer hatten wir uns die drei Nächte New York schon durch vorherige Aufenthalte in IHG-Hotels erschlafen.\r\nFür Platinum Priority Club - Mitglieder gab es ein schönes großes Zimmer und Clubzugang zur Concierge Lounge. Dort hat man einen super Blick aus der 46 Etage auf den quirligen Times Square. Das Club-Personal ist allerdings sehr mufflig und knurrig und wenig serviceorientiert. Gebrauchtes Geschirr wurde in Plastikschüsseln sichtbar gesammelt. Die Gäste mußten sich meist den Tisch selbst abräumen, die Snacks waren sehr übersichtlich, das kontinentale Früstück minimal, aber für die erste Mahlzeit des Tages geeignet. Die Lounge schenkt keinerlei Alkoholitäten aus. Zur Schließzeit 8 p.m. wird man ziemlich unfreundlich der Lounge verwiesen. HIer könnte man ja die kostenlose Ausgabe von Softdrinks beenden und die Gäste noch ein bisschen auf das nächtliche Treiben schauen lassen............\r\nDafür gibt es einen kostenfreien Zugang zum riesigen Fitness-Club des New York Sports Club.'
3,'Poor Customer Service','I booked a room here for my wife and her mother and sister during the past weekend. They reported many problems with the customer service.\r\n- It took them over an hour to check-in as the front desk was severely understaffed. \r\n- Even though I am SPG Gold, the staff told them internet was not free (untrue)\r\n- Staff did not replenish water, shampoo, soap, conditioner before the 2nd night\r\n- Staff eventually allowed late check-out, but only after some persuasion\r\nThe hotel does have a great location and the rooms are high enough that you cannot hear noise from Times Square.'
3,'No frills hotel, very average but good if you just want a place to stay','Booked this hotel through Expedia so came in a package deal. I have never been to New York but my partner and I decided to do Christmas in NYC 23rd to 28th Dec. I was super excited. I read some reviews on this hotel and they were mixed but decided to go with the package regardless, we only wanted a place to sleep, we planned to be out and about the entire trip.\r\nFirst impression of the hotel as we walked through the revolving doors was good, until I reached the reception where the receptionist was less than friendly or welcoming,..they say the Brits are unfriendly...jees! Having knocked the excitement out of me, after a near argument over the name the booking was made in, we eventually checked in (even though we were told it was too early by the rather hostile receptionist). \r\nThe room was a queen room. I read on a review to expect these rooms to be small, but that is saying something. To be honest though, we really didn\'t mind, we didn\'t spend any time in the room apart from one night when the snow storm hit on the 26th.\r\nThe rooms were cleaned everyday and the standard of that was brilliant. The room was comfortable and quiet. That\'s all you need in NY really or your going to the wrong city my friend!\r\nThe ticktock diner adjoining the hotel we were told was not the best. It was brilliant, so ignore comments on this. It\'s busy and not massively friendly, but it is so busy, the service is quick, it serves a purpose and the food was good and reasonably priced.\r\nOne big piece of advice I would give is to get a yellow cab if going to JFK. The hotel facility is expensive, and even the porter was trying to railroad us into using it and talk us out of getting a cab, he tried very hard knowing we were from the UK! The cabs can only charge $50 max and that is exactly what we paid, just make sure the cabby agrees before you get in!\r\nOverall, a comfortable hotel to stay in if you just want a bed for the nights you are staying. Ignore the porter trying to rip you off and expect a hostile greeting from the receptionist!'
4,satisfait!!!!!!!!!!!,'nous avons séjourné 4 nuits à l\'hôtel!!!!le personnel est accueillant et serviable!!!il y\'a une conciergerie si vous avez besoin de quelque chose où le personnel est serviable!!!\r\nLa chambre où nous avons séjourné était spacieuse et très propre!!!par contre salle de bain un peu petite mais pas dérangeant!!!\r\nnotre chambre donnait sur l\'avenue mais nous n\'avons pas été dérangé par le bruit!!!\r\nl\'hôtel est très bien placé!!!entre central park et time square!!!\r\nil y\'a une bouche de métro juste a l\'entrée de l\'hôtel!!!!facilité pour se déplacer!!!!il y\'a pas mal de restos aux alentours et une superbe boulangerie où nous avons fait des supers petits déj!!!!\r\npour ce qui est du tarif!!!!c\'est New York donc je pense que le rapport qualité prix était intéressant!!!\r\nen tous cas nous n\'avons pas eu l\'impression de nous faire voler!!!!'
5,'Excellent, Friendly Service','Had family fly in for a weekend recently and I reserved two rooms at the Hilton New York for them. When they checked in the front desk staff was extremely professional and friendly. I am an Hilton honors Diamond member and I chose the option to have an upgrade to a suite if available. To my surprise the one room I needed upgraded was. The entire staff is professional and friendly, the rooms are much larger than your average New York hotel room. The amenities are modern, as are the rooms. The executive lounge is on the 44th floor, for you to see Central Park and enjoy a snack or drink. The location is excellent, it is only a couple blocks from Central Park and half a block from the 7th & 53rd subway stop, you can get the E train there. It is several blocks from the theater district, it is only a 10 minute walk. If you plan to visit New York, this is one of the few hotels I would recommend. If you are a fan of Halal food, right on 53rd is the Halal guys carts, just right outside the hotel. The Hilton is located on the avenue of Americas, far enough away from Times Square yet you know you are in New York. My family enjoyed it, my Nephew ate duck for the very first time, at the executive lounge. They will be staying here again when they return to visit.'
2,'All fluff, no filling...','As with every hotel you\'ve ever visited, there a always a few things you\'d like to see changed. In this case, the list is a little longer than usual and I felt compelled to offer my two cents. \r\nThe common spaces in the Hudson are anything but common. As a matter of fact, they scream Hip, Chic, Too Cool For the Likes of Me! The Private Garden with its eclectic mix of decors, and the Skytop Terrace with its inspiring view are unparalleled even in NYC. The experience is truly unique.\r\nHOWEVER, Caveat Emptor! The Deluxe  Room we had was still quite cramped for the two of us. The small closet was barely large enough for our clothes (for only a two night stay), no drawers or dresser of any kind to stash your socks and undies (we kept this stuff in our suitcases at the bottom of the closet), no beverage fridge, the TV was outdated with a rather small screen (of course, a larger screen would probably look like a movie screen in our room), the ironing board was the size of a small cutting board from my kitchen, and the small,contemporary nightstands and narrow glass and chrome desk offered very little space to place anything more than your wallet and sunglasses. It seems that function and utility take a back seat to form and idealized aesthetic.\r\nThe staff was a 50-50 mix of frienldy and downright cold as ice. It was surprising that the lower paid staff (bellboys, housekeepers, servers and bartenders) were always friendly and warm, while the higher paid staff at the front desk and concierge desk were cool and aloof, to the point of seeming bothered that you were standing in front of them, blocking their view from the passers-by. Of course, the average age of these staffers is about 20 and, as we have come to learn, customer service is lacking everywhere.\r\nI work in the service industry as a caterer and I can speak from experience: always offer the customer more than he\'s expecting and make sure it tastes as good as it looks -- especially when you\'re charging top dollar.\r\nAnyway, that\'s my 2 cents -- well, maybe 5 cents...'
4,'Electric shock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!','Well what to say, just got back from New York New York (08-02-07), I loved the place, I\'m 31 and expect good service and friendly staff, I could\'nt have asked for more. The bar is great though they do tend to put reserved signes on everything, just tell them to stop being silly and have a drink. The room was the loft suite, so I thought loft and top of building went together, I was wrong, the room was fine if your happy to hang everything and leave the smalls in your bags, it could do with somewhere to put your pants and socks but hey I\'m sure Phillip dos\'nt wear them so why should I???.\r\nBe prepared for a massive electric shock when you call for the lift, the static that my girlfriend and I where getting was painfull, we ended up using our elbows, when I mentionened it to the very sexy staff with there short skirts they had never heared of it.\r\nIf your after a good central location with good cabs and access to the park then this is the place for you, if you want very quiet staff and a lobby that has no atmosphere then look elsewhere.\r\nGo there and love it, thats what I did and I am looking to go back next month.'
5,'Location, Location, Location!','I stayed at the Edison for a week recently and was very pleased. The staff was extremely polite and helpful, the rooms were suffient for what I needed, and the location is beyond compare. Located at about 15 steps from Times Square and Broadway, it doesn\'t get any better than this. The Hotel is older, however; it\'s antiquity is it\'s glory. Built during the Deco era, the wall panels, wall borders and ceilings in the dining area all original and truly something to see. The Edison dies have it\'s quirks, but for the location and the price, expect the best! I was able to book tours to Washinton D.C. and Boston at the Concierge desk. I love this hotel and would cetainly stay again!'
4,'surpassed expectations','Before going to New York last september we were thinking about cancelling our reservation at the Hudson because of the many reviews saying that the rooms were small, but then we decided to give it a try.\r\nThe hotel is amazing, the room (dlx double double) was very nice, with a good size (it had two double beds, a little tv room and a normal bathroom).\r\nIt\'s definitely worth staying there. I like it and would recommend it.\r\nEven the restaurant there had a good food, and it\'s worth the price.\r\nRecently I\'ve been trying to contact them by email but got no responses. If anyone has the manager, or someone else\'s email (from the hotel), please tell me.\r\nThank you!'
1,'Hudson is Most Loosy hotel ever','I am currently AT the Hudson. I am FURIOUS that the bank I am working for put me in this hotel... definitely it should not be on the corporate hotel list. \r\n-Room is a JOKE... 10m2... makes me clostrophobic. I can\'t even seat in the toilet without knocking my knees against the wall.\r\n-The night curtain is difficult to catch.. and it is VERY DIRTY around the windows.\r\n-There is no water pressure in the bathroom.\r\n-Staff is rude and would fit better.\r\n-The room was supposed to be ready at 3pm and was in fact ready at 3:30pm.\r\n-10yrs ago it used to be a loosy Motel at usd 35 per night\r\n-0 view from the tiny window\r\n-Loosy lighting\r\n-Noisy aircon that wake me up 5 times last night with a mettalic noise\r\nI AM VERY UPSET WITH THIS [--] HOTEL MY BANK PUT ME IN.'
4,'The Perfect Choice!','Affinia Manhattan has been my first choice for my last three trips to NYC. It has a GREAT location: I fly into Liberty Airport, take NJ transit to Penn Station, and it\'s just catty-corner from the station! No cab needed! It saves me time and money. The rooms are tremendously spacious for NYC and I love the little kitchen! Clean, modern fixtures in the bathroom, comfortable beds and friendly staff -- what more can you ask for?'
3,'Great location and value, old bathroom','The location could not be better for tourists. If you get a good rate, it\'s totally worth it. The rooms are very spacious, especially for NY. Our bathroom, however, was not up to the standard of the room and the rest of the hotel. There was quite a bit of mold. The bathroom lighting is rather dim. If the bathrooms were modernized, the overall experience would be greatly improved.'
4,Funcional,'Um hotel muito bom para quem viaja com o objetivo de explorar a cidade. É muito grande, muita gente se perde nele, não tem nenhuma pretensão de ser pessoal na assistência, mas não tenho queixas quanto aos funcionários, que trabalharam todos muito bem durante a minha estadia. Os quartos são pequenos, mas são limpos, instalações adequadas. Uma localização perfeita, em frente a Penn Station, que tem trens para todos os locais que você imaginar em New York e Nova Jersey. Além da estação do metrô que fica exatamente embaixo dele. É uma ótima opção para o viajante que vai acordar, se arrumar pela manhã, tomar café na rua e voltar só à noite.'
5,'Christmas Eve in Manhattan','The Affinia Manhattan is a great base of operations from which to see Manhattan. It is centrally located with easy access to almost all of Manhattan\'s sights. My wife and I met our two grown children in Manhattan for a sunny but chilly Christmas Eve, 2011 and had a marvelous time. We arrived early at the Affinia and were quickly checked in by JENNY, who helped make our stay unforgettable. We headed straight for the Highline, that great, new park which allows one to wander down the west side from Mid-Town to the West Village. We met our children for lunch at Coppelia, an unpretentious eatery on W. 14th with delicious Cubano sandwiches, many other items and friendly service. We then walked uptown to Broadway where we saw an outstanding performance of Other Desert Cities, with Stockard Channing and Rachel Griffiths, which we all heartily recommend.\r\nAfter the show we went back to the hotel for a short rest before heading out to dinner. Dinner was at Ai Fiori, an upscale Italian restaurant on Fifth Avenue. The restaurant is beautiful, with a wonderful view of 5th Ave from its second floor location. The service was immaculate, the tables quite roomy, and the food was good, but overpriced. The restaurant has an extensive wine list, but most of the bottles are quite expensive and out of reach for this tourist.\r\nWe had another nice walk after dinner, back to the Affinia where our children dropped us off before going on to their night time activities. My wife and I were ready for a rest, and we watched a little TV before falling off to sleep in the Affinia\'s comfortable king size bed. In the morning JENNY wisked us through checkout and both JENNY and MARGARET made us feel almost like family as we prepared to go out to breakfast and eventually head back upstate for more partying on Christmas Day.\r\nWe come to New York often and always sty at the Affinia, because of its great location and friendly staff. Thanks JENNY and MARGARET!'
5,'Great location!','We were upgraded to an Atrium Club room upon our arrival, which was a nice surprise! Apparently, these rooms were recently upgraded and it was definitely apparent. The room itself was modern and comfortable and we were really surprised at how large it was for a NYC hotel. It came with an in-room Mac with free internet, which was a great help as we planned out our itinerary for the day! The pillows weren\'t the most comfortable, but the bed itself was pretty nice, so it wasn\'t a big deal. \r\nThe Atrium Club rooms also come with a free continental breakfast. I usually pass on hotel continental breakfasts because they\'re usually pretty crappy, but my husband dragged me to it. And it was actually GOOD! Lots of selection and it was actually a nice, calming atmosphere... not the normal hectic hustle and bustle of a too-crowded dining area of a hotel. \r\nApparently, having an Atrium Club room also gives you access to the hotel\'s nightly cocktail/hors d\'oeuvre party, but we didn\'t go so I\'m not sure how that is. It was nice to have that option though. \r\nOverall, great hotel, great service, good food... and you absolutely cannot beat the location. Staying in the middle of Times Square was awesome. I\'m planning on going back for my birthday in May and I can\'t wait!'
4,'Great location','Booked the hotel based on various web-sites and were not disappointed. Check-in was a bit slow as computers had crashed and when we got to our room, it was already occupied!\r\nBack to reception where they found us another room within minutes and by way of an apology offered complimentary breakfast for all 4 days of our stay - nice touch!\r\nThe room was excellent; well furnished, clean, a huge bed, coffee-making facilities and fridge. OK no bath but decent shower and a bit noisy but hey this is New York!\r\nOverall excellent value considering we were only across road from Penn Station, 10-15 minutes walk from Times Square and a few minutes from the Tir Na Nog Irish Pub which was a perfect place to end the day with a decent pint.'
4,'Shopping Trip','Basic enough hotel - stayed for a shopping trip with a friend so it ticked all the boxes we required. Room was a tad small and the bathroom a little out dated but other than that it was great! Location was perfect!'
3,'juste moyen','Durant le séjour de 9 nuits, il y\'a eu des haut et des bas dans cette hotel....Mais il reste très moyen...Les 3 premiers soirs, nous avions des jeunes italiens près de nous et nous n\'avons pas dormis de la nuit...(J\'ai pourtant 26 ans et le sommeil profond!)\r\nBref ensuite ca c\'est un peu calmé...Les chambres sont simples mais propre!\r\nJe ne regrette pas davoir choisit cet hotel car le rapport qualité/prix était bien... et de toute facon nous partions de 8h a 23h....donc juste pour dormir cela suffisait...et il est très très bien situé!'
5,'Head to the Hyatt for a Grand time!','I\'ve been wanting to stay at this hotel for a number of years and finally, it happened! Now I regret waiting so long to do it! After spending one night in another hotel close by, I was definitely delighted by the room, the decor and the staff. Would I stay there again? You bet!'
5,'New York City','Stayed at the Southgate last month having seen the excellent reviews on tripadvisor. Was not at all disappointed - had a 1 bedroom suite with 2 double beds, decor and layout was very much like the virtual tour on the Affinia website. The Southgate has the best of both worlds with spacious, well appointed rooms and the benefits of a large hotel (restaurant, fitness room etc on site). I have stayed at several different NY hotels in different locations (including the Waldorf for 2 nights on this visit) over the last 8 years and the Southgate is now top of my list. The location is central for public transport with Penn Station (Metro, Amtrak, New Jersey and Long Island links) opposite the hotel. The M20 bus also provides a good service to the lower West Side and uptown. Macy\'s, Herald Square and the Empire State are five minutes walk away. Starbucks is opposite (although I thoroughly recommend Niles for breakfast - stops at 10am though). There is a fire station below the hotel, which causes some noise daytime and evening, but we had no problems sleeping. On the whole, I can\'t fault the Southgate and look forward to my next visit.'
5,'Very happy with the hotel','The staff is very helpful. Great location. Comfy beds and pillows. Great restaurant. Hip and trendy.'
4,'Lovely hotel','The rooms are small, but very nicely furnished. The lobby is quite beautiful. The staff are very helpful. There\'s no room service, but the Tick Tock Diner is open around the clock. This was a great location for us; we were able to walk to most of what we wanted to see and the rest was a short subway ride away.'
1,'DO NOT STAY HERE - what a dump!','Im just back from NYC - do not stay in this hotel. On the first day we walked into our \'superior\' room and the most disgusting smell greeted us. We had to go to a chemist and buy an air freshener! Back in the room we notice about 3 square feet of dingy carpet was saturated over by the radiator that never worked (room freezing throughout our stay) and finally the ceiling caved in! A lump fell down and missed my open suitcase by inches and Ive photos of it! I also noticed there was more rust in the bathroom than actual chrome. When we asked to be moved rooms we were told go back down to reception and re-check in. So we had to get dressed, pack up out stuff go back down to reception and didnt get an apology or an acknowledgement of what had just happened. The 2nd \'superior\' room we moved into was much better on the 11th floor yet the 1st one on the 9th floor was a sh!t heap! The staff were extrememly rude and the only thing that concerns them is getting money off you - I was hugely disappointed and have vowed to NEVER stay here again. I stayed here 5 years ago and it was no problem but this place has seriously gone downhill in every way - rooms, staff, service etc. Trust me you will be glad you didnt stay here, take my advice I learned a very hard and expensive way!'
3,'So impersonal','The location of this hotel is fine, close to Central Park, 5th Avenue etc so you can walk to most places. However, I know this is a large hotel - 2,000 rooms I imagine, but it was not good. The service was pretty bad, the room very average, and very impersonal. We stayed in a Club Room but any advantage you may get from getting a quiet breakfast is not possible. There are so many Club rooms and the Club Lounge is very small. Also you have to pay for internet connection in the room, which is not acceptable. The breakfast in the Club Lounge was not good with very little choice, seating was a major issue and frankly it was like a zoo. Not a good experience to set off for a business day. Sorry Hilton but this a real disappointment.'
5,'great buffet','Being Starwood owners, we stayed at the club floors which were great. The best deal was the free continental breakfast and the hors d\'oerves. Between these 2 meals, we did not need to go to any rest. for dinner or lunch-we used the time to enjoy the city.\r\nConvenient to public transportation and helpful staff'
3,'Great Location-Times Square on your door step!','It\'s situated on 7th Avenue (aka Fashion Avenue) between 31st & 30th street west opps Madinson Square , which is an idea spot to do your sightseeing and shopping. We did alot of walking every where, because most of the places we wanted to see are within walking distance ie Emprire State Building, Macey\'s & Times Square.\r\nThe rooms are good size which includes a mini kitchen ( which was handie), and the beds are big comfortable, staff were friendly & helpful.'
5,'Great Customer Services','Stay in Crowne Plaza has been a incredible experience. Services, qualities rooms and amenities, etc. The experience begin from the reception, when Evelin, who knows what is the best way for showing to the guests the friendly of New York, tell you hello.'
5,'New York City 1st timers loved the Hyatt!','We just returned from a weeklong stay at the New York City Grand Hyatt hotel. The hotel staff was friendly and when we needed extra towels or our air conditioning adjusted, they took care of it within minutes. The concierge services were very helpful as we daily inquired about restaurants or about the best way to get to our destination. In the lobby, we were able to print our boarding passes for no charge before we left. We were on the 27th floor and only once had to wait a couple of minutes for an elevator. Our 2 double beds were very comfortable and was adequate for my husband and I and our two young adult children but queen beds would have been more ideal. There was a nice closet and the bathroom was small but worked out fine. There were two full-length mirrors in the room where primping could take place also. It was a wonderful location for tourist activities. Grand Central (Station) Terminal was right next door making subway riding very convenient. There is a subway shuttle that only goes from Grand Central Terminal to Times Square back and forth all day, which takes less than 2 minutes. If you have a subway map, the routes are well marked and easy to follow to go throughout the city. The 7 day subway pass was such a bargain. We travelled to Central Park, Yankee Stadium, Statue of Liberty, Times Square and to several television shows on the subway. We did a fair amount of walking and found all the tourist areas to be clean and we felt safe walking around. The cost of having Internet at the Hyatt was too expensive for us so we used one of the 5 Starbucks within a couple blocks of the hotel to grab some coffee and check our messages, etc. There are a couple of drug stores right by the Hyatt; a McDonald’s down the street and a variety of restaurants around. The Grand Hyatt was a great hotel for our first time in New York City and we would stay there again.'
2,'Great Design, But You Can\'t Sleep in the Lobby','As a design student, I\'ve heard rave reviews about the Hudson. The public spaces are amazing and I recommend a visit to the bars and outside spaces. However, I would not recommend staying there. I travel to NYC quite often, and travel tons for work. This is the smallest room I have ever seen in the city, and frankly, my room on my last cruise was bigger; for example, you have to negotiate the toilet bowl to climb into the shower--beware handicapped travelers! About our average stay: 1) the staff greeted us with a smoking room, and made it clear we were less than because we booked on Priceline (for what turned out to be full price), 2) our room was not serviced by housekeeping (we had to call daily), 3) the bathroom pocket-door didn\'t work (causing a bit more intimacy than we wanted) - we called the desk 3 times for the bathroom only to be told that engineering was on its way. -- engineering never showed.'
4,'Great Hotel','We stayed here in August/Sept 2009 and had read all the reviews. We were worried about the noise and the staff. We had a great time, our room was ting but we expected that and it was super clean and modern, the staff were friendly and helpful. We had no noise in our room at all. The Hudson is a great bouitque hotel and is close to everything, we walked everywhere!'
5,'Pricey but worth it!','I\'m a working man so I generally do not spend this kind of dough on a weekend. That said I spent it and it was, as Tony the Tiger would say GRRREAT\r\nThe Hotel is located right in the heart of Times Square you walk out the door and bam 20,000 people some of whom are dressed as cartoon characters and a few in underwear and cowboy hats. If Times Square is your destination than you simply cannot get a better location. I spent a few extra bucks and got the Times Square view room which was neat but if I were to go back I would take a pass on the view as it\'s cool for about 5 minutes.\r\nThe room was fantastic, had a big king size bed that was perhaps the most comfortable bed on the planet, a couch and chair and a good size bathroom. The best thing about the room was that we would return to it at night through the massive crowds, pull shut the blackout curtains and literally would not hear or see a thing until I opened the curtains in the morning. I think they must have built the hotel out of the same material as Control used to make the Cone of Silence, was brilliant!\r\nRight across 45th street is Junior’s which has fabo cheesecake and also serves a limited menu and beer but Junior\'s is about the cheesecake which is like eating a piece of cheesy heaven. There\'s also as variety of chain restaurants (Hard Rock, Bubba Gump, TGI Fridays etc) and pubs within a few blocks.\r\nCheck in and checkout was fast and efficient. Our room was not ready when we arrived but we were permitted to check our bags and provide our cell number for them to call us when our room was ready. Of course our cell stayed in our checked bags so that didn\'t pan out so well but that\'s more a me issue than a hotel issue lol. \r\nThe top of the Marriott has a revolving restaurant on the roof which affords you a great view of the city while being served overpriced drinks by Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Hasselback and Star Jones.....or at least they should be serving you for the price you pay. Great place to head up to for a drink at night but I wouldn\'t recommend it for dinner unless you\'ve got some deep pockets.\r\nAll in all a great hotel, in a great location, with a pretty great staff.'
5,'A very nice place in a great location','We booked a 5 night stay in a corner room. The room was large and the beds comfortable. The only negative was a noisy air conditioner but we would return. We had a small problem with late housekeeping one day and when I spoke to the manager at the front desk they sent someone up immediately. Very nice stay'
2,'Most We\'ve Paid - Least We\'ve Had','This was a business with leisure 3-night stay.\r\nWith the UN talks on, the prices throughout were high and our usual choice of hotel full ... we thought Park Central\'s location was pretty good near Central Park, close to restaurants, etc ...\r\nHowever, we were not at all happy with the room. Small, dated. Less than clean nets on windows. Comfy clean bed, thankfully! Request for non-allergic pillows had not been catered for and we had to change the feather pillows. \r\nWe tried to change our room and we were told they were all the same, nothing bigger, better, and none more recently decorated (10 yrs) I am astounded by some of the earlier descriptions. Tried again second day, same thing applied.\r\nHi-tech minimalist lobby, bar and lifts - and that\'s it.\r\nService was minimalist too, no frills, no turn-down service, but we had paid 4* prices.\r\n$14 per day for internet.\r\nI like to give credit where credit is due. Here it would be to Louisa, a charming check-in lady who did try to help us.\r\nWe paid too much for this accommodation.\r\nWe would not stay there again in spite of the location.'
5,'The perfect hotel!','I won\'t stay anywhere else in Manhattan. This was a very on-the-spur-of-the-moment reservation as travel plans were disrupted. We had an extremely comfortable suite--for just one night!--which provided us with the complete relaxation we needed. The receptionist, Michelle, was delightful and most helpful. Our dinner in Niles was outstanding, too.'
5,'Fantastic Location ~ Great Value for Money','Fantastic Location ~ Great value for Money \r\nYes, hotel was built in 1919 and has 1700 rooms and 12 elevators.\r\nAll areas that I saw were clean and corridor carpets were in excellent condition (7 floors inspected).\r\nNever leave home without your comfortable walking shoes and a light wind and water proof jacket.\r\nA great city to walk around for 2hours plus every morning.\r\nRoom number signage directions on each floor was excellent.\r\nMy room 1006 (August 2012) was clean comfortable with a floor to ceiling tiled bathroom. \r\nYes, It did have a brown carpet on the floor. Perfect colour for a busy hotel.\r\nThe water pressure from shower was strong and only minutes for hot water at 05:15 or anytime I used it.\r\nCheckin was fast and efficient after 13:00 on a Thursday for a 10night stay. \r\nYes, It did get busy on a Saturday afternoon with people arriving for weekend in New York. \r\nBroadway shows, dinner with friends and numerous other reasons to visit NY on a weekend.. \r\nHotel is located in the middle of Manhattan. \r\nSubway Red line minutes away and Penn Station just across the street. \r\nPenn Station has Amtrak, LIRR (Long Island Rail Road), New Jersey Transit and two separate subway lines (one at 7th Ave and the other at 8th Ave ends of Penn Station Lower Ground Level) .\r\nYellow Taxis available 24/7. \r\nNumerous eating choices between hotel and Times Square (5mins walk or one subway stop).\r\nVery easy to find a 24hour fast-food outlet (many choices) for a early morning breakfast snack. \r\n24/7 convenience stores are easy to find within Penn Station and anyway to Times Square.\r\nSubway Red line is excellent to downtown to South Ferry Station at Battery Park (Staten Island Ferry terminal at top of escalator) or\r\nuptown to Times Square, Columbus Circle and Upper West Side all the way to Harlem and the Bronx.\r\nVery easy to get to Brooklyn via the subway or City Hall Station. This is a great spot to view the Brooklyn Bridge or walk across it.\r\nAn excellent walk along the Hudson River Park Promenade all the way down to Battery Park.\r\nView the reconstruction of the World Trade Centre site and Wall street etc.\r\nYes, I will stay again during my next visit (14night stay) to New York. \r\nI will and have recommended this hotel family and business colleagues.\r\nYes, New York has plenty of other hotels at up to and over twice the price.'
4,'Great place to stay','The situation of the hotel is perfect for a visit to NY. The breakfast is one of the best we ever had in the US'
5,'Loved it and will definitely be back!','I chose this hotel for a mother-daughter weekend get-away and it was perfect for us. What an outstanding location (The Loop) close to Millenium Park, Buckingham Fountain, Water Tower, and the Lakeshore Path! Very accessible to CTA subway & bus routes. I have read the negative reviews about the size & amenities of the room but our room with two double beds was just perfect! Very comfortable beds and we slept very well! Bathroom was small but clean. Loved the lobby!!!! Enjoyed dinner at Lockwood Restaurant on site. Awesome complimentary breakfast on the 23rd floor! No wireless internet in the room but wired access is complimentary for HHonors Gold & Platinum members. Loved it so much that we\'ll definitely be back!'
5,'Eh esquisito mas vale muito a pena','Eh um hotel antigo, mas vale muito a pena, tem quartos - o Penn 5000 com cafe da manha - Vale a pena!\r\nA cama muito confortavel, o espaco do quanto excelente.\r\nCompre pelo decolar.com\r\nNao deixe de comprar o ticket MTA serve para metro e onibus.\r\nA localizacao eh muito boa.'
3,Location...Location....Location,'This hotel is old, the bathroom is very small, the room is ok...no frills, only one of the 3 lamps in our room even came on, but in 2 minutes you can walk into Times Square. \r\nFor the price, I would stay there again. You are about a 5 minute walk to Hell\'s Kitchen Area where there are dozens of eclectic restaurants. We only slept and bathed here, so no complaints. Just set your expectations low and throw the luggage in, lock the door and hit the street!'
5,'Amazing Renovation','The new rooms are breathaking and modern. The decor is beautiful with the tree theme. Very clean and spacious. I even had my own walk in closet and could turn the lights on and off from my bed! Love...love...love! I can\'t wait to stay here again =)'
4,'25 watts short','Though aging, the Hudson is a feast of modern design, with dramatic spatial sequences, a gorgeous elevated garden, and meticulously designed very compact rooms. Service was personal and engaging. Music did go on quite late - be ready for it. My only annoyance was lighting levels: halls are night-club-dark, disorientingly dark, frustratingly dark, even in the bright mid-day. A masterful piece of design, great urban experience, just 25 watts short, in every bulb.'
4,'Couldn\'t have picked a better place!','I absolutely loved this hotel. I only have two very small complaints. First off, the cleaning staff was extremely loud in the hallways each morning. They started at 8am, there were lots of them, and they were just loud going up and down the hallways and slamming doors open and close. The doors were awful. Our room even had a hallway before actually getting in to the main room and we could still hear all of the noise from the hallway, so I can\'t imagine how loud it would be if you were not in one of the rooms on the end. The doors on each room did not have traction that slowed them down when closing, so they slammed shut every single time someone went in and out. This was super annoying as in Times Square people come in and out A LOT! This seems like a small thing, but after hearing it for 4 days non stop...it just made me mad. But not mad enough to make me not want to stay there..I should have contacted the front desk but I was just so exhausted I didn\'t want to deal with it.\r\nMoving on...everything else was perfect! I had a really hard time picking a hotel, I wanted to stay in times square and wanted ideally a 4+ * hotel, but didn\'t want to pay the $300/night price tag on most of them. SO, I kept watching Hotwire rates, and booked our 4 star hotel about 5 days in advance for $203/night. This was a complete steal!! Our neighbor in the hotel paid $325/night for their room and I researched other prices for much more. I am so thrilled with the rate we got! I suggest you watch Hotwire for the best deals!\r\nThe hotel is smack dab in the middle of Times Square, but you would never know it. Inside the hotel it is modern, sleek and surprisingly quiet and calm. Other than our loud maid service, our room was a quiet paradise away from it all. \r\nWe requested early check in and a king bed, we got the bed but not the early check in which is okay since we could check our bags in and leave them while we toured around. The room was beautifully decorated, the bed and linens were perfect and the bathroom was wonderful as well. This is the second time I have stayed at a Crowne Plaza and have been completely floored by my experience both times.\r\nLove this hotel, love the location and would definitely return!'
4,'Vacaciones Familiares en NY','El Pasado Mes de Agosto, disfrutamos de 5 Maravillosos Dias en Manhattan, junto a mi esposa y 4 hijos menores, fue nuestro 3er viaje a NY\r\nUtilizamos los Servicios de una MiniVAn de Carmel Limo, que nos recogio en La Guardia y costó $50 el traslado al hotel + propinas\r\nNos Hospedamos en el Affinia Manhattan en la 7ma Avenida y Calle 31, diagonal a Penn Station\r\nNOs Hospedamos en Una Suite con un Cuarto con Cama Matrimonial y un Estar con Sofa Cama Matrimonial y Cocina, la Suite tenia 2 Baños y 2 TV LCD de 40, la cocina tenia una pequeña nevera, Cafetera y Horno Microondas, solicitamos una cama extra adicional, que nos costó $30 diarios, la Suite era amplia y limpia, todo lucia mas o menos nuevo y la cama era muy comoda, el Baño principal poseia, bañera sin ducha y una ducha que si era muy estrecha, el jabon, shamppo y demas accesorios eran de primera, no asi el papel higienico\r\nLa Primera Noche sentimos unas Sirenas, pero los demas dias no sentimos nada, a las 7:00 am suenan las campanadas de la bella Iglesia que queda en frente\r\nal salir del hotel hay un Dunking Donuts, enfrente hay un Starbucks Cafe, Diagonal queda la estacion del tren Penn Station, alli hay un Duane Reade donde podemos conseguir Agua, Leche, Cereales, Medicinas, etc al mejor precio, Cerca hay McDonalds, 5 Guys Burguer, Fresh Co, etc, tambien Bancos y ATM\'s, podiamos caminar y volver a Times Square desde alli, sin problema alguno\r\nLa Habitacion es limpia, la arreglan todos los dias y es la mejor relacion precio valor'
4,'Location, Location....','Stayed for two nights with my other half - a rare weekend away without the children. Should also add that we were staying on Hilton Honors points. We were duly upgraded on checkin (as a Gold VIP Member) and were up on the 43rd floor. Room was nice, but not epic.This is a BIG hotel, even by NYC standards. We didnt use the Bar or Resturaunt during our stay. We did visit the Executive Lounge each night, and although there was a decent amount of (average) food on offer, drinks were VERY expensive. $15 for a G&T. At these prices I would go elsewhere, but I didnt realise until after ordering them. On the plus side, if you sit at the Northern end of the lounge, you get great views down to central park. The hotel needs a refurb IMHO - pretty tired everywhere. But all the staff we encountered were friendly and always happy to help. The location scored highest for me. I love 6th Avenue, and so its perfect for seeing NYC on foot. I would stay there again if the rate was OK. If you are paying, its not cheap!'
5,'What a location.','On a business conference with my husband, 19 yr old twins a 13 and 11 yr old. We booked an executive suite with interconnecting room. Room are enormous and contained a double sofa bed and separate king bedroom. The other room contained two double beds and a sofa. The beds were extremely comfortable, however the pillows not as good. Staff will assist you with any enquiries however if you require new room keys ensure that you carry ID atall times. The hotel is also very busy which makes it a little conjested at times. The location is outstanding, right in the heart of Times Square. Would return to this hotel in a flash - truly recommend this one for both business and pleasure.'
5,'Fantasic Marriott in the Heart of it All!','We stayed at this hotel for two nights during a recent trip to NYC. The location is superb, in the heart of Times Square and short walks to iconic NYC landmarks such as Rockefeller Plaza, Central Park, Columbus Circle and very easy access to subway stations. You are also mere steps from Broadway\'s best shows such as Lion King, Wicked, and Chicago. \r\nThe staff was very friendly from check in to check out, and went out of their way to be accommodating. Room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. The view really stole the show being on the 43rd floor facing the northern half of Times Square.\r\nBe sure to go up to The View restaurant while you\'re staying for a 360 degree revolving dinner. You can make a reservation for table service or go up for the buffet.\r\n If you want to be in the middle of the tourist action while in NYC, I would definitely recommend this hotel.'
2,'Stop! Go back!','Great location. Perfect. The service was horrible. Long line to check in. We got in at noon, and couldn\'t check in until 3:00 so we asked if they would hold our luggage. Yes, for a $4 charge! The bathroom was disgustingly dirty, the outlets were coming out of the walls, indeed, they were not even placed so you could use them. Code enforcement?! The paint was chipping, the armoire was broken. And no Wi-fi! I\'ve heard of this in other hotels, but here?! True you could go out to public wi-fi, but it\'s so cheap, why wouldn\'t you add it. Staff couldn\'t have cared less that we were there. Seemed to be a breeding ground for partiers, quite frankly. We came home with bed bugs which we\'re pretty sure came from this place. And speaking of beds - hard as a rock. The lobby gives you this Manhattan 1940\'s appeal which lulls you into thinking the place is going to be charming. We asked the doorman to get us a taxi, and he put very little effort into it. Don\'t stay here! Run! Walk! Whatever you need to do to stay somewhere else!'
5,'Great hotel, great location, great trip!!!','I loved the hotel and its location. The room was very nice. I had read several negative reviews, so was concerned about what we would find when we arrived, but everything was perfect! You couldn\'t ask for a better location ...one block from all the action, so you don\'t have to listen to all the traffic noises at night, but it only takes a few minutes to walk to great fun! Make sure to search the Internet for a coupon code to use at this hotel. The deals out there are great! Shrek The Musical was wonderful! I laughed just as much as my 16 year old daughter did. I also recommend the sightseeing tour (red bus). We took the uptown, downtown and evening tours (48 hour deal). Since you can hop off and on, we used it as our taxi service. For those of you who are thinking of traveling to NY, I also recommend using Amtrak. We took the train from DC to Penn Station and had no problems going either way.'
5,'Official Trip to New York','The Hotel was too big and very nice hotel. My room was at 22nd Floor. View is very cool from 22nd floor. Best Hotel in this world'
5,'this is a comfortable hotel in a great location','This hotel is very comfortable and in a location convenient on foot to midtown Manhattan as well as other areas by nearby public transportation - the staff was friendly and helpful throughout our weekend stay - the hotel is very clean, and the 6th floor room we had was quiet - rooms are a bit smaller than those in some hotels but well maintained - this hotel is an excellent value for the price and I would recommend it to anyone - I found it on line and I am very glad I did !'
1,'Not acceptable','The room was worn out. Bathrooms were too small and old. Kitchen was run down and appliances needed to be replaced. I was afraid to turn on the stove. Lobby is great but rooms are not. It is conveniently located to Madison Square Garden but that is all it has going for it.'
3,'Just average','I was very disappointed with my stay @ westin times square. Being a westin, i expected it to have a semi-luxurious feel to it but the hotel is old. Being a platinum member, I thought we\'d get upgraded but it wasn\'t the case. No extra water in the room so we got some from store nearby but when you\'re spending at the hotel and have stayed there for a while you expect certain a higher level of service.\r\nI think the location of Times square is a bit too touristy. Most of the nice restaurants are away from the area so union square or soho would probably make a better location with more character.'
4,'Localização perfeita!!','Apesar do quarto ser pequeno, a localização do hotel e a limpeza compensam esse detalhe. E o visual do hotel é maravilhoso.'
5,'What a perfect location!','Once again I used Priceline and lucked up! I could not have asked for a better location. The hotel lobby is still under renovation, however it was not a problem. The staff was very friendly even called us to tell us our room was ready while we strolled the city! The room was huge, and clean. The bathroom is small but served its purpose. Now , the BEST part, its attached to Grand Central . We were a minutes walk to anywhere in the city! Grand Central is so pretty, so take time to explore inside . Also a Magnolia Bakery and Juniors is downstairs! Love their cheesecake! It was a perfect mini vacation!'
3,'Veraltet aber zentral','Hotel ist veraltet, durch die Klimaanlage im Fenster ist dieses nicht isoliert. Es zieht und aufgrund der zentralen Lage sind die Straßengeräusche sehr laut. Mit einem Zimmer zur Rückseite ist man besser bedient.\r\nDirekt gegenüber der Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Macys'
4,'LOCATION IS EVERYTHING','Stayed just last week for 7 nights. The location is directly in Times Square. Amazing. If you want a view make sure you ask for one when booking. We requested early check in but it was not available but they have luggage storage. All staff was very nice, hotel was great. The location was awesome because it is in midtown. Just up the block was the subway which we were able to take all over the city and get anywhere we wanted to go. Overall loved it will stay again. My only complaint would be housekeeping. You have a card you have to lay out if you want your sheets changed and that was fine for us. We didn\'t need them changed everyday. However the same amount of towels/bath cloths was not left everyday so some days we ran out but made do. In addition, we used the glasses provided everyday and about 3 days we had to wash ours ourselves because they did not take the dirty ones which I sat out all together for them to get. That is the only mishap. Overall loved it, will stay there again. This was a sisters trip and we loved NYC.'
1,'Where\'s the service?','Decided to stay in city after seeing marvelous play and dining at a great New York restaurant.\r\nFrom there everything went downhill when we checked into the Park Centeral on 7th ave., one of the few remaining afforable (??) hotels left in NYC at $320.00 per nite tax included.\r\n Elevator system worked like a big video game, plugging in your floor number and getting assigned the correct elevator - kinda efficent but a hassle. Our bathroom sink was obviously not clean, appeared someone just brushed their teeth (the clorex wiped we brought helped).\r\nAfter 11pm the telephone rang several times and no one answered. Tryed to call downstairs but phone went dead. Oh well, to bed, its late anyway. At 2 am awaked feeling like in a sauna. Get up to adjust the heat, nothing works. Call downstairs - phone doesn\'t work. Used cell phone to call hotel, get an operator, said she would transfer us. The phone rings 20 times, no answer. Back to bed for restless sleep, sweating. Next morning (feeling awful), find hotel bill under door. We at least know somebody works at this hotel, the person that delivers the bill!\r\nIt\'s Manhattan, for $300 bucks I suppose we should be grateful we even found a room. Next time, spring for the $700 - $900 per nite hotel or train back to the burbs.'
5,'New Years Eve at the Marriott Marquis','If you are going to go to New York\'s Times Square for New Years Eve then THIS is the hotel to stay in. \r\nFrom about 3pm onwards, the Square is full of revellers and closed to anyone else. The Marriott gave us a specially-printed room-key for the night which counted as a pass that allowed us through each of the various cordons and into the square itself. So while thousands had to make themselves comfortable for many hours before midnight, we bimbled in at 11pm, had a quick drink in the hotel bar then joined the revellers for the fireworks and tickertape...which is well worth it! \r\nAs for the hotel itself, our deluxe room looked onto the Square, very comfortable indeed and kept wonderfully clean (albeit with minor hiccups such as missing coffee/cups on a couple of days). The service is excellent and the concierge couldn\'t do enough for us. \r\nThe hotel lounge on the 8th floor is a great place to relax while watching the goings-on in the Square and the View lounge on the 49th floor has superb views of the city. \r\nLocation-wise, as can be imagined, it is right on Broadway for the theatres and within a short walk of Central Park to the north and Soho/Greenwich to the south. Penn Stn and Grand Central are also very close if arriving/leaving by train. Several lively bars are also within staggering distance from the hotel.'
2,'Location is great BUT this hotel is second rate','Great location right on Times Square, but location does not make for a great hotel and great stay. \r\nWe booked and paid for in advance for a 8 nights and checked out after 2. Our reservation was for a concierge room so we could get a higher level room view with all the amenities that a concierge room offers, but what disappointment this hotel turned out to be. This is one very busy business orientated hotel, Grand Central is quieter at rush hour. Duty managers and staff have a condescending and patronising attitude towards guests which reflects on how this hotel is run.\r\nStay away. There are much better hotels around Times Square that actually want you as a guest.'
4,'bien situé','hotel tres bien situé dans Manhattan, a deux pas du Chrysler building et collé à grand station.\r\nBien que tres luxeux, l\'hotel souffre d\'un manque de charme indéniable. il est tres impersonnel et ressemble plus à une galerie d\'un beau centre commercial.\r\nLes chambres sont par contre d\'excellente qualité.'
3,'Excellent emplacement!','Nous avons séjourné 5 nuits à l\'hôtel Edison en Novembre.\r\nL\'emplacement est IDEAL! Au coeur de NYC, quel bonheur de se lever sur Times Square. Pour le petit dej fuire l\'hôtel et aller au petit déli juste à côté il y a de tout (céréales, café, muffins, etc...).\r\nDu côté de l\'accueil c\'est très impersonnel comme souvent à Nyc mais peu importe. Impératievement demander une chambre en étage élevé à partir du 12ème pour diminuer le bruit de la rue.\r\nUn autre conseil réservez une chambre triple ou quadruple, la différence de prix n\'est pas énorme mais par contre la place oui! Chambre vieillote, l\'hôtel est ancien, mais draps et serviettes changés tous les jours.\r\nEn résumé une situation idéale pour un hôtel simple mais pas trop cher pour la destination!'
2,'The location is excellent! The management and customer service are very disappointing!','The location is excellent! That’s the only advantage of this hotel. The check-in staff is very cold and there is no greeting. \r\nI want to give an advice to everyone: don’t buy their breakfast package. I paid $10 for the breakfast for each day. When I checked in, the staff gave me coupons (blue-colored) for free continental breakfast in a nearby restaurant Tick Tock Dinner. When I used the coupon in the morning, I just could not believe my eyes. The breakfast only includes one glass of juice, one cup of coffee, and two very small pieces of toast. It’s hardly enough for my three-year old son. The second morning I talked to the front desk staff. The guy was very rude. So I talked to the manager. She said she needs 30 minutes to find out what went wrong. I just don’t want to waste my time to wait for half an hour for this. I requested a refund. But she refused. Later she offered to give me a different coupon (red-colored) for American breakfast-a much better one. Now I realized that the check-in staff tricked me. She should have given me the red coupons. So the management and customer service are very disappointing! I just want to remind everyone: if you pay for the breakfast, DO ask for the red coupon.'
5,'Excellent location, great service.','This hotel is well located a few blocks south of Central Park. You can also walk to Broadway and many restaurants from this location. Prices are moderate (for New York) and the staff is very helpful.'
4,'Simple without the frills.!!!','My husband and I stayed for 10 days in this hotel at the end of May beginning of June 2009. The room was spacious enough, adequately clean, towels were changed daily and even though we had asked for a room away from the elevators which we didn\'t get, anyway it didn\'t bother us too much. we also asked for a fridge to be put in the room which was very useful for drinks etc. The best part about this hotel is its location being in the heart of Times Square. We would go back there again.'
1,'The worst of the worst, horrible, photos very deceiving!!!!!!','The worst of the worst, quoted one price, charged another, quoted price for parking, charged another, had to pay for ice, asked for a garbage bag since house cleaning didn\'t empty the trash cans and we had water bottles ect, lined up all over and was told no, don\'t worry about it, one door man was very rude, one doorman was very nice. The room was dirty and dusty, I was afraid to take a bath, just couldn\'t make myself sit in the tub, did take a shower, used a towel in tub to stand on, but the water pressure was great.\r\nThe rooms are very small, furniture very old and in bad shape, one electrical outlet for charging cell phones, sheets did not fit the beds, beds did not fit the frames, room smelled damp, musty, NO LOCKS on the bathroom door, key cards needed to be used at least twice, first time never worked. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!'
4,'Not The Best But Very Adequate','If you want the best Starwood Property in NYC, stay at the St. Regis or possible the W Times Square. I found the Westin to be just fine: larger than average rooms for NYC, nice bathrooms, good club lounge, very good fitness room, great location, friendly staff even in the hectic day leading up to New Year\'s Eve.'
5,'Wonderful customer service!','I would definitely recommend the Westin Times Square. The front desk staff is wonderful, and the hotel is a fabulous oasis of calm amid the hustle bustle of Times Square.'
1,'Great location, nice lobby, everything else was very poor','My grandson and I stayed on 8-7-2009 for one nite. We arrived about 2:00 PM and the line was almost to the door and there were 2 clerks working the counter. The hotel finally put 2 more clerks on the counter but we still had to wait for 1-1/2 hours to check in. after checkin we went to our room (374) and believe me it was the second worst room I have ever stayed in. The room was in bad need of renovation, the AC was making a lot of noise, the bathroom was horrible, the bed I had moved around a lot . I have never seen doors as old and the windows needed washing bad. I hate to never come back or never recommend to Hotel to anyone else because of the great location but that\'s the way it is.'
5,'Great location','Nice place to stay and the location is great. Little things like internet and using the business center are extra though.'
2,Dingy,'I stayed here for a conference. The conference facilities were fine but the hotel rooms were dank and dingy. Broken tiles in bathroom. Not enough blankets. No wake-up service. \r\nI met others at the conference that stayed a few blocks away and walked over. I would do the same next time.'
4,'Great location and a place to put your head','Firstly, I was sceptical after reading reviews on here so expected the worst. Was very pleasantly surprised. I took a group of schoolchildren and the staff there were very accommodating with them. Yes, there is quite a wait at the front desk, but from what I could see, it was mainly people skipping the line to \'just ask a quick question\'..... I waited in line for that!\r\nThe rooms were all fine - the sheets were clean and the bathrooms acceptable. The hotel is old, and could use a bit of an upgrade, but if you\'re looking for somewhere to put your head down that\'s close to Broadway and Times Square, then this place is ideal. It\'s not the Ritz, but it was comfortable and my group enjoyed their stay there.\r\nThe staff were also very helpful in providing information to get around, which helped us enormously.\r\nDownsides were the lack of chairs in the lobby, slow lines and the fact that they wouldn\'t/ couldn\'t cancel a room which was booked for us in error.\r\nUpsides were location, helpful staff, historical interest and comfort - our rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels and bed linen provided.\r\nI would go with an open mind and keep in mind that its just a place to get some rest - you\'re in New York, so why spend time at your hotel??!!'
4,'Classic Hotel - nice rooms and location','I have stayed here numerous times over that past year for business. It is blocks away from the museums and lakefront. And of course there are great restaurants close by including Al\'s Chicago Beef. The escalator ride from the street level up to the main lobby is amazing especially as you begin to see the lobby ceiling. I like ornate, old school hotels and the Palmer House is one of those. Most of the rooms that I have stayed in are updated and decorated nicely. I will say that I have Hilton Diamond status so most of them are upgraded rooms. The lobby bar is great and also the restaurant. I have used the workout facility which is top notch. The executive level 23rd floor does get a bit crowded in the morning so arrive there there early if you can. The front desk personnel seem friendly and competent delivering a speedy check in process.\r\nOverall this is one of my favorite hotels when visiting downtown Chicago.'
5,'Great Hotel - Period!!!!!!','Stayed at the Edison Hotel for the second time from December 27th to January 04th so we could enjoy the fantastic Times Square new year.\r\nBooked this hotel in February 2005 and got a very good price for 8 days. When we arrived at hotel there was no queue for check in which was great. We were served promptly and taken to our room (1918). I asked for this room as we had it the time before and it was great. No noise from any nightclubs and a good size. You may hear noise from outside such as the occassional horn or fire truck but you\'re in New York city not the Scottish highlands and this lets you know you\'re in the middle of the Big Apple.\r\nNo problems with elevators and the maid tended to our room daily and always left fresh towels and supplies. No issues what so ever with cleanliness.\r\nSo close to the center of Times Square you have to see it to really believe it. You may get nicer hotels in Times Square, but for this price this is by far the best value and the cheaper price meant more to send on shopping.\r\nThe subway in New York is cheap and a fantastic quick way to get around the city. If you need to eat when you\'re staying at the Edison I strongly recommend eating at the Deli right next to the hotel. It is called the New Diamond Cafe which has a great deli counter and serve such fresh food and drink at fantastic prices (Not yet listed on tripadvisor so I can\'t review).\r\nThere are a lot of reviews written on this website by people who I think have a chip on their shoulder and write anything they can to make this hotel sound bad, but take it from me - This is a great value, great location, great staff - Great Hotel!!!\r\nI hope that if you have booked you aren\'t put off by any reviews and I hope that when you come back you also leave a real review of the Edison Hotel New York.'
3,'BUEN HOTEL','A pesar de estar en cuanto a instalaciones generales bastante antiguo, las habitaciones están reformadas y muy bien. Estuvimos en la planta 42, habitación con dos camas enormes y aplitud, baño pequeño y antiguo en la línea de lo habitual en USA. Y las vistas maravillosas!!! El Empire State de frente majestuoso.\r\nLimpieza correcta, y al tener tantas habitaciones y trasiego de huéspedes lógicamente la atención del personal es bastante fría pero correcta. Se habla, con en casi todas partes en NY, español. Los restaurantes no los probé, ya que cualquiera que haya estado sabe que en NY se está deseando de salir del hotel e invertir horas y horas en las calles.\r\nNY en verano es muy caro, aun así califico la relación/precio de buena.\r\nLa única pega la primera noche la máquina de hielo del vestíbulo resultó algo ruidosa, pero con el cansancio no hay ruido que valga!'
3,'Needs TLC','We stayed here a few years ago for a major convention so we chose it again for a one night stay in the city before embarking on a cruise. Although the room is very comfortable, it does have a postage sized bathroom, which makes use of available space for little compartments to stock the hair dryer and assessories. But the room was extremely clean and spotless. And an extremely comfortable bed. \r\nThe corridors to the rooms are crammed with housekeeping carts and you have to negotiate around them. Isn\'t there a room to store these? Also the corridors have torn wallpaper down the length of the corridor, worn carpets and dingy lighting. You wonder how bad the room will be as you look for your room. \r\nThere was major road work below us (we were on the 40th floor). We heard this construction noise into the evening and then early in the morning. \r\nWe had an executive level room but after the hordes of people in the executive lounge for happy hour (which was also lacking), we bypassed the free breakfast and chose the restaurant on the main floor. The dining room wait staff was very pleasant. \r\nThe location can\'t be beat but it needs TLC. Will we stay there again? Most likely.'
4,'Good hotel','We (a family of 12 - 6 adults and 6 children, travelling from Spain and Denmark) stay in the hotel four nights in Easter.\r\nWe were a little bit worried after reading some of the negative reviews. But we had a great stay. We checked in quite fast and without problems. The rooms were fine. Clean, good beds, big tv. We were 12, ages 4 to 75, and none of us had a single compain during the stay. We had just spent some days in the Hilton in Washington DC, and the kids thought this hotel was much better.\r\nGreat location. We ate breakfast at the hotel and it was ok. The only minus was that they tried to charg eus the breakfast, although this was include din the rooms price. But the hotel solved the problem inmediately. They have a service desk and all our questions were attended fast, precisely and with a smile.\r\nIf I go back to NY I will definetively stay again the hotel.'
3,'It was okay','We toured a time share next door and they arranged for us to stay at this hotel. We paid $200 a night which was a discounted price, I believe. The room was very small and hard to move around in. Pathways were very narrow. The view was nice as we could see Times Square. We were there the week before Easter and the hotel was filled with school groups. They took over the downstairs lobby completely, so we were not able to use that area at all. They kept our bags for us before we checked in, but we had to pay a fee. The location was good as it was very close to Central Park and Times Square. There were affordable local eateries nearby. The hotel restaurant was too expensive for breakfast or lunch. Access to internet was $15 a day. No thanks, I went to the Starbucks down the street and got wifi for free. I don\'t think I would choose to stay there again.'
1,'Great Location - Terrible Hotel','We\'ve recently got back from a 2 week trip to California, Vegas and New York. Of the 5 hotels we stayed in, the Edison was by far and away the worst hotel. Don\'t get me wrong it has a great location practically on Times Square but the hotel itself and the service was appalling. \r\nWe were checked in by a desk clerk with practically no customer service skills. He barely acknowledged us and kept muttering This is ridiculous to himself about 4 times as he was apparently having to deal with some other problems at the time. He then handed the room key to the bell guy and said nothing to us like room number or enjoy your stay or anything. The bell guy took us up to our room. (The bell guys are great as I think some other reviewers have said). We were on the 6th floor with the most ridiculously noisy air conditioning going on from a nearby building. We asked to be moved and ended up 2 (?!) rooms down in a slightly quieter room (as the hotel was supposedly full). With no other option we tried to spend the night there and despite a few drinks to help sleep and earplugs we still kept getting woken by the noise. The next day we were moved to a room on the 19th floor which was the size of most other hotel bathrooms (but quieter). Never once did we get apologies, not to mention for the times the room cards stopped working. The hotel is in desperate need of a refurb. The power points are plain dangerous. \r\nOn the upside - great location and a fantastic deli is 2 doors down which is great for breakfasts and lunches, but the hotel itself is a house of horrors.'
4,'Rien de tel! Très bon rapport qualité/prix','Oui c\'est vrai, j\'ai couché dans plus beau mais... au Edison tout est tellement proche! Ce qui fait oublier le lit moins confortable et le décor désuet. On est tellement fatigués après une journée à NY que le confort du lit est presque secondaire! Direct sur Time Square, proche des metros (Subway), proche du terminal d\'autobus. Besoin de luxe pour pas bien plus cher? Juste à côté l\'Hôtel W, allie modernisme et semble plus confort...'
1,'I ladri di Manhattan','Il peggior hotel mai visto ! Contrariamente alla loro presentazione sul web, l\'hotel presenta le seguenti caratteristiche :\r\n- camere sporche moquette sporca e bucata\r\n- pareti scrostate \r\n- arredi anteguerra in condizioni pietose\r\n- bagno originale probabilmente del 1919,con scarafaggio annesso di dimensioni viste neanche in Africa\r\n-vasca da bagno improponibile\r\nLe fotografie del sito si riferiscono probabilmente ad una camera ben nascosta...., la connessione wireless è disponibile solo nella main lobby a 10 dollari al giorno , mentre è disponibile una sala computer alla modica cifra di 5 dollari ogni mezz\'ora.\r\nUna nota degna di attenzione : attenzione a non usare il telefono durante il vostro soggiorno,due telefonate intercontinentali in Italia di 3 e 6 minuti più due tentativi di telefonate senza risposta più due telefonate locali totale costo $165...., segnalato il ladrocinio la risposta è stata che va bene così,l\'errore probabilmente è stato di non richiedere un preventivo o un mutuo.\r\nDeposito bagagli $4 al collo, attenzione anche ai negozi all interno dell hotel: se avete bisogno di un adattatore per ricaricare il vostro cellulare(un pezzo di plastica e ferro da 50 centesimi di euro)lo pagherete sei dollari .....insomma se dopo questa recensione avete ancora intenzione di intraprendere questa avventura....noi vi abbiamo avvisato, per nostra sfortuna abbiamo scoperto troppo tardi l esistenza di questo sito.'
1,'nothing great or to write about','staff lacked customer service and very unhelpful. check in was ok but check out took ages. would not return to this hotel or location.\r\nrestuarant was awful and expensive\r\ngym was badly located\r\neven reception toilets/rest rooms were disgusin i w=could not go to them and when i had reported it no one bothered to do anything about or help in any way!'
1,'Never again','upon arrival we were allocated the two rooms as requested on the same floor, my friends had their luggage delivered first gave the porter a more than substantial tip explaining that it was for both rooms, he then brought our cases I then tipped him stating it was for both rooms he didnt bother to say he had already had a tip. I then noticed we had only one towel no hangers bath robes or slippers so contacted room service requesting these items as we were waiting to freshen up after a long flight, 45 minutes later I phoned again with the same request, after another 20 mins I phoned again, to which the reception acknowledged the two previous requests and could not understand why we had not received them. After 90 minutes with still no sign of the items we went out. This was common throughout the stay having to request towels and toileteries, we gave up on the robes and slippers.\r\nWe had been looking forward to this trip for many months and staying at the Westin, fortunately we had done our homework for our first visit to New York, what a good job we did as trying to get any sort of information out of the concierge was like talking to a brick wall. They were only interested in fee paying excursions.\r\nOne of the people in our party smokes and would go outside the main doors where the ash trays were situated for smokers, this became a game of dodge the beggar, as soon as a cigarette came out of his packet he was constantly asked for a spare fag or loose change, this was by the same people every day, this was not an issue for him but other travellers could be easily intimidated by this, this is carried out in full view of hotel staff.\r\nI must say we all enjoyed our first visit to New York, which was not spoilt by this hotel we had a fantastic time and met some winderful New Yorkers, who made our holiday for us.\r\nDont be caught out by the stocked fridge in your room, the prices are extortunate, dont move anything in the fridge you will be billed, why the hotel cant ask if you want the fridge empty or stocked is beyond belief, if you want to use a fridge you have to pay for another to be delivered, this is really petty as the cost of staying in the hotel is enough.\r\nOn the day before check out we wanted to check the weight of our luggage after spending nearly 40 minutes on the phone trying to arrange this, this large hotel has only one set of scales by reception where you have to keep taking your cases to and hope that the Business Centre is open and that somebody is there, if not you have to wait, as nobody else has access to this room!!!!\r\nOn the last day when we received our bills we were taken aback to find we were being charged for items from the fridge(which we had not used) and over $120 for telephone used, when I challenged the whole bill and asked the reception to show me in the small print that you are charged for making a connection and produced the phone card we had used they apologised and refunded the account in full. How many people would just pay?\r\nWe then proceeded with our cases to have them put in the hold untill our departure whilst we went for lunch, the same greedy baggage porter from the first day approched us with a trolley gave us a ticket for collection and in his words he said this is a free service but anything you wish to contribute would be much appreciated and as I might not be here when you come back for your bags could I have a tip now this is for pushing a trolley 10 yards through a door as we had loaded the trolley ourselves. Can you believe the cheek, we are seasoned travellers and have been to many parts of the USA and the Carribean we have always tipped more than the going rates recommended and have always been looked after, dealing with these porters was a completely new experience, you felt that even if you looked at them they wanted a tip for doing so. When our taxi arrived the same porter was still on duty, but another porter brought our cases to us from the hold area all of 5 metres we duly tipped him, we then collected our cases ourselves and walked the 15 metres to the awaiting transport, at which point yet another porter said Taxi Sir my partner replied no mate we already have one, at which point the porter or parrot tried to repeat what my partner had said in an English accent, taking the mickey as we had no use for him, how rude is this.\r\nWe will be visiting New York again as its a great City with wonderful sites and people, but would never stay at the Westin again, maybe the Management should keep a close check on the extra activities of their porters who spend a lot of time in full view of the public counting their tips,and maybe train their concierge to be able to give knowledge of the City when asked for specifics .'

4,'Practical and utilitarian with the right degree of comfort, excellent location and connectvity','HUDSON HOTEL:\r\nThe Hudson is an excellent hotel for a quick business trip. It was my first trip to the US, and the hotel was on the conference website that I was presenting a paper in . It was my first solo trip and I was a bit apprehensive. \r\nThe online booking was seamless , though I did contact them a number of times on phone and mail for a airport pick up but was unable to get the service. \r\nThe check in time of 3:00 p.m was clearly mentioned , but for international travelers with flights arriving early morning , the 6 hour wait after a 20 hour flight is extremely taxing and HUDSON could make alternate arrangements . \r\nThe location is excellent in the heart of the city with the metro station at walking distance and the central park so near I would take a morning walk each day before leaving at 7:00 a.m for the conference.\r\nService is satisfactory and unobtrusive. In fact you hardly see any staff. The completely unmanned business centre is a real eyeopener , especially in comparison to India where a dedicated staff would cater to the needs of the guest. \r\nThe single room is too small and a solo guest is advised to take a double room. The room is extremely comfortable with modern interiors with warm wooden paneling on walls. \r\nthe staff at the reception desk was extremely efficient and helpful attending to all my needs from changing the room after check in at a attractive rate, I only wish my request for an early check in was also taken care of , as spending 6 hours sitting in the lobby after a 20 hour flight was a torture. \r\nAll and all if I were to come again solo I\'d try this again , but if with family , I\'d prefer a more cheerful and brighter property.'
3,'Suck in that gut!','The place is hip/trendy/ooh-wow, and MINISCULE. My room was small, which was fine because I was there for a humid heat wave, and the a/c worked gloriously. This is not a hotel where you should anticipate a lot of company in your room. Lots of trendy-but-dumb features (glass-walled showers, wall hooks, no dressers, etc.). Toiletries were gorgeous. Location was good. Thank goodness I got a great deal on priceline. Oh...and the staff was without exception wonderfully helpful.'
3,'Basic hotel for a city visit','This hotel is only a place to sleep. The rooms are basic, with comfortable beds but no fridge. There was mould on the walls of the bathroom and the wallpaper was peeling off in many sections of the room. There is no free wifi-we used the starbucks internet when sitting opposite the concierge in the lobby. Definitely ask for a room on a high floor with a view - some face an internal courtyard with no outlook at all and low rooms look onto the hotel air-conditioning units. The front desk wasn\'t helpful, my friend was told she was finishing her shift and wouldn\'t help only to be informed by another worker that the lady still had another 2 hours to go. Try and avoid the workers asking if you\'re interested in watching a broadway show in the lobby, they\'re trying to get guests to attend an information evening on a time share building attached to the hotel.'
5,'Best place ever!','This is perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed in. My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our 1 year anniversary, with a high recommendation from one of my co-workers. My wife being a Silver VIP HH member helped us in getting upgraded to an updated king room. Basically the hotel\'s rooms go in stages, the higher your room is, the nicer the room. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous and the location is just a quick walk from Central Park and Rockafeller Center. The breakfast is a bit pricey, but if you talk with a Hilton representative via phone, see if there is a deal that includes breakfast in your stay (which in most times is cheaper per person). I highly recommend this hotel!!!!'
5,'Great location, great hotel and great service','first trip to NY from England and stayed 3 nights, \r\nThe Edison is just how i imagined a NY hotel to be with so much character and charm with a most attractive art deco lobby area, its like stepping back in time in the best posible way. \r\nit may be older than many other hotels but this is a bonus rather than a negetive and with the right revovation works that are now taking place i can only see it getting better than it already is. \r\nFrom check in to check out we were met by helpful and friendly staff. The room was basic but filled our need perfectly, comfortable beds and good views over to NJ and many magnificent buildings.\r\nThe hotel souviner shop was well stocked with new york gifts as well as basic items such as snacks, drink and personal items.\r\nThe concierge desk was very helpful in directing us to the correct subway trains to take to and from brooklyn. (take a walk back over brooklyn bridge for some great views over lower manhattan)\r\nBathroom although small, was ok with everything working perfectly including the shower, we had fresh towels and the beds made up everyday.\r\ncafe Edison is great for breakfast with a quick and efficient service from friendly staff that will set you up for the day. There are many deli\'s and restaurants all within walking distance and being in the heart of thearter land all the best shows are only a short walk away.\r\nAs a base for exploring new york the location was perfect right in the heart of broadway and Times Square, and about a 10 minute walk to Central Park and 15-20 minute walk to the Empire state building, bryant park and grand central station, (maybe all less than that, as we paused to take photos along the way), there are subway stations within a few minutes walk from the hotel that will take you all over the city. we found the one on 42nd str the best for our journeys. and a shuttle right to grand central station from there.\r\nI would have no hesitation recommending the Edison Hotel to anyone, its got the perfect location, full of charm, helpful friendly staff and rooms at a great rate, what more could anyone ask for especially for what could be the \'once in a lifetime trip\' to New York'
2,'Lousy Club Room','How can this property be rated as a Category 6 by Starwood?\r\nI have stayed in Starwood properties on over 30 occasions this year, and have been in the top tier of their frequent stayer program for more than 10 years now.\r\nThis is one of the most over-rated properties I have stayed in. The foyer and checkin staff met expectations - it looked good, and the staff were helpful, polite, and very friendly. The room was just okay. It was more consistent with a Category 3-4 hotel - very basic furnishings, bland decor, poor quality window covers, and not that much better than an average to superior motel (some Holiday Inn Express properties have better looking rooms).\r\nThe view was quite poor. The higher floors get great views from 3 sides only - so \'bad luck\' if they allocate you a room on the side looking towards time square, as you can\'t see much past the buildings next door!! Maybe a higher floor would have helped, but we were on a floor in the high 20\'s.\r\nOur biggest problem was the Club room at breakfast and evening drinks time. They had clearly booked more people than the space, amenities, food, drinks, and staff could cope with. At breakfast time we had to cue for 20 minutes for each breakfast item we needed. It was mind boggling to see that they had two toasters for 50 people in the room! A long time to wait for those bagels to toast! There was insufficient seating, and we had to wait a considerable amount of time on each morning. If we stay again, we would prefer to go somewhere else for breakfast - it isn\'t worth the 1 hour trauma to get two bagels, juice and coffee.\r\nWhen I provided the duty manager with feedback on our last morning, she did apologize, informed me that it was because they had so many people booked for Easter, and offered us another breakfast in the main restaurant. A better response might have been for the hotel to manage its bookings so they could meet demand and/or increase the space for its Club amenities if it wants to cater for so many people.\r\nIf you\'re looking for a \'reasonable\' hotel, with no particular frills, in a great location - then its pretty good. If you\'re expecting something special - particularly for a Category 6 - then you are likely to be disappointed. If you\'re used to the Westin hotels of Europe, Australia and Asia - then give this a miss and try the much more stylish W at Times Square.\r\nPeter and Ann\r\nMelbourne, Australia'
5,'Great hotel, great location...','Stayed here October 31 through November 5 for a cconference. This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel. My room was small, but beautiful. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. Alas, no coffee maker in the room...The staff was helpful and friendly. I\'d stay here again!'
2,'dec 10 thru dec 12 2011','The bath tub did not drain for hours and the corners were gross. There were cracks on the wall everywhere. However it was warm. The employees down stairs did not know New York at all. When asked where the nyairporter bus was located for pickup they had no idea.'
3,Disappointing,'Perhaps it\'s something about New York branches of Starwood hotels but this was nowhere near as good as other Westins I have stayed in. The W was worse, far worse, but this doesn\'t come anywhere close to, say, the Westin Sydney. I mean it was OK (although the bathroom was stainless steel and looked like it was surplus stick from a prison) but the little things are annoying. Like $45 for three days internet, which was perpetually slow - like a modem - and unreliable despite being wired ethernet. I am sitting on a plane now flying from east coast to west and have internet which is not only better and faster, but cheaper, than the Westin variety despite being at 40,000 feet. The internet rip-off in hotels is unjustifiable. Likewise $7.50 for a bottle of water from the minibar. So the view was nice, but the basics need to be better.\r\nThe only hotel I persistently like in New York is the Muse, sadly booked this time. Nothing fancy but it does the basics really well and is a nice place to go back to after a day of work.'
3,'Average hotel in superb location','We stayed here to kick off our honeymoon tour of America. On arrival we were very disappointed as we were given a tiny dark cupboard of a room with no view other than pigeon mess and a broken lampshade. After complaining we were given another larger room with two large windows and a view toward times square. Apart from the odd member of staff most were surly and unfriendly. On the day of the wedding we asked the manager if he had a room we could use for half hour for the groom to change in but his offer was pay for a full room stay or use the public toilets!!! Not particularly helpful or romantic!!! The cafe adjoining is cheap but food only average. Best thing about this hotel is its superb history and original art deco features along with its unbearable location just s few steps from times square and Broadway. We came to love it for its history but if you are hoping for a modern plush hotel look elsewhere. On plus side the bed and pillows were the comfiest ever and the room was very clean if a little dated.'
5,'Amazing Times Square hotel','Stayed here during a short long weekend trip to NYC. Location is bang in the middle of Time Square giving quick access to all of the sights in that area. Despite being in the heart of the city, the bedroom was surprisingly quiet with no street noise, and the neon lights kept out with heavy black-out curtains. (we had paid for a Times Square view room).\r\nLobby is located on the 8th floor and is a huge, brightly lit area with a couple of shops, an ATM and ticket booth for Broadway shows. There is a walkway to the sportsbar and restaurant, which has a perfect view out across Times Square.\r\nAbsolutely no line for check-in, and throughout our stay there were three staff at the concierge desk. They were extremely helpful with local knowledge and directions.\r\nRoom was very large - big kingsize bed, with a couch, seat, desk and chair at the other end of the room infront of the window. Large flatscreen TV with the usual choice of channels and PPV movies. Bathroom was also very large and everything was spotlessly clean at all times.\r\nWe ate a couple of times in the hotel (just snacks such as nachos), which was always good, Serving staff in the bar and restaurant were friendly, and the service was quick.\r\nManaged to see all of the sights across a long weekend, and the hotel was very comfortable for relaxing at the end of the day. I\'d definitely recommend it if you want to be in the action.\r\nOne suggestion - there is a fantastic bakery across the street from the hotel (on a side street) called Juniors - extremely good value for money and really high quality food. We ate there a couple of mornings - just bought from the shop and sat in the covered outside area and watched the world go buy. Breakfast for two about about $8.\r\nOnly minor point is the price of internet access - $16.95 a day, which across a weekend does mount up. I appreciate it\'s paid for by the people who actually use it, but many other big chains offer free internet when you stay. It\'s normal across Marriott to pay.\r\nThere are cheaper rooms in NYC, but you are getting decent value for money in terms of location and comfort.'
5,'Awesome location, and great hotel','You can\'t beat location if you want to be close to the subway, for ease of getting round the city.\r\nThe Hyatt is right next door to Grand Central station, and is a great choice.\r\nThe room we had was huge, with a walk in closet which was great for storing cases and served as a dressing room.\r\nThe room was very clean, and the staff very helpful.\r\nThe marketplace is great for breakfast and any snacks, although we did find an awesome patisserie just inside Grand Central station that served just as nice pastries, but a little cheaper.\r\nWould stay again!'

4,'Review of this property','Everyone was very helpful. The desk person was good in giving me directions to anywhere I wanted to go. I enjoyed the excercise room. It was very clean with top of the line equiptment. A water dispenser and towels were provided which was nice.'
3,'Immaculate Room, But the Size of My Closet','I\'m NOT kidding. The bedroom area was literally the size of my walk-in closet, which is 9x9; I paced it out. Room for the queen-size bed, a teensy utility table and an uncomfortable chair. The shower was literally 24 inches x 46 inches (I counted the tiles). The (small) toilet left my knees about 6 inches from the wall...and I\'m 4\'-11! If I were a left-handed guy, I couldn\'t have shaved using the sink. My husband, who is 6\'-8 would not have fit in the space at all! It was also 90 degrees when I walked in. I promptly turned on the A.C. to 60, but kept it at 65 during the night, which worked fine for me. The closet consisted of a 2\' rod with about half a dozen hangers; the ironing board did NOT hang on the wall, so it kept falling over and I had to set up the luggage rack to keep it away from my clothes, which was quite inconvenient. The luggage rack wouldn\'t have fit anywhere else, except maybe the miniscule hallway, but one would have tripped over it getting to the bathroom.\r\nMore on the funky bathroom. The side of the shower wall consisted of clear glass with a white fabric shower curtain. On the room side, there was a filmy (inexpensive) white nylon curtain. The entrance to the shower was likewise covered by a white fabric shower curtain. \r\nOn the whole, three rooms in this hotel would have made up into two decent-sized rooms, but then again, they couldn\'t have packed us in like lemmings...NOT that the hotel was anywhere near filled. As I said, I paid only a hundred bucks for my room...the rack rate being about $150. I don\'t know how packed they are on weekends, but they certainly weren\'t full during the weekday I was there.\r\nOK those are the negatives. On the plus side, the room was very clean and had lovely linens and a very comfy (if low-slung) bed...more on a futon-style size. A normal height bed would have made the room look even smaller. It was quiet by NYC standards. I was in town overnight for surgery the next day, and for an inexpensive room (you can bid online; I got it for $100) it was quite decent. The neighborhood is also safe, a huge plus. As a former New Yorker, I can tell you it\'s convenient...close to 57th St., so transportation is decent--crosstown buses, the #5 which goes down 5th Avenue passes nearby, as do 7th Ave. buses (hop one to get to Times Sq.), and uptown 8th Ave. buses. It\'s also near Columbus Circle (and not far from Lincoln Center) for the #1 local train (7th Ave. IRT) and the A train (8th Ave.). I was too tired to go out for dinner, but the hotel food was decent and tres nouvelle. (See my review for details.)\r\nI\'d rate the room size a 1, but the quality of the room a 4, so it averages out to a 2.5-3.\r\nNow more on the hotel, which I found fascinatingly funky. I was probably the oldest patron in the hotel (I\'m 64); seems to cater to a late 20\'s to 30-something crowd, most of whom are techno-trendies (or wannabees). The front of the hotel doesn\'t look like a hotel...no grand marquee...and you take a long escalator up to the lobby, which is dark, spattered by pools of light. A Grand Chandelier hangs over one of the front desk receptionists, sort of a crystal Sword of Damocles. My receptionist was a nice guy who smirked when I asked if the room was the size of a closet with an air shaft. He told me that the single rooms were smaller. I couldn\'t possibly .imagine. A bank of elevators off to the east side of the lobby was, likewise, dark. It has about 22 floors and a warren of rooms on each floor. The overriding decor in the hallways was institutional cell grey with white doors. Lots of doors. Lots of little cells. Oh, and the bath ameneties were nice and first-rate. An ok place, but not if you travel in pairs and definitely NOT for families. Nary a child in sight, which in some instances could be considered a blessing. As an aside, I had just paid half the amount for a room at a Red Roof that was 4 times the size...but, hey, that was in Cleveland!'

3,'Read this review ****','Me and my friend stayed at the Pennsylvania Hotel for five nights at the beginning of November 2006. The staff were very helpful and friendly when we arrived and we were soon in our hotel room. We stayed on the 15th floor and the room was very roomy but quite dark as it only had one lamp! We asked for another and it was soon delivered. Over all, the room wasn\'t the cleanest but it is a budget hotel so you get what you pay for! It just needed modernising more than anything. As for the location... it\'s absolutley fantastic! We were facing Madison Square Gardens,10 min walk to Times Square and 5 mins to the Empire State Building. If your staying local one night, make sure you check out Harringtons bar across the road. It\'s an Irish bar and the lads are really freindly and are a good laugh. I would stay at the Pennsylvania again coz its not THAT bad as most of the reviews say!'
4,'Expensive, but great location!','We were 2 couples, each traveling with a teenage daughter, staying at the Grand Hyatt, March 19-25. We got our rooms for $190/nt. through priceline.com. Since it was Spring Break, we thought the price was okay. \r\nThe hotel lobby is beautiful and the rooms are understated. Beds were very comfortable with down comforters. Bathrooms were a bit small but water pressure was good. Our first night we had a king with roll-away. Our room never quite cooled off, so we slept with the window open all night since it was cooler outside than inside. Both couples asked to be switched to double/double rooms and the hotel accomodated us the next day. The thermostat in our new room worked fine, but the tub and sink drained very slowly. After informing the front desk the next day, problem was fixed. Staff was very friendly throughout stay; no New York attitude here. \r\nHotel is located between Chrysler Building and Grand Central Station. It is a great location. There is a passage that leads from the hotel to Grand Central Station as well as the subway. There is also a subway shuttle that runs between Grand Central Station and Times Square (the S) only, so even though Times Square is only a few blocks away, you can ride instead of walking. Plenty of restaurants in Grand Central Station (including Starbucks and several other coffee bars). There is a Duane Reade drugstore at the corner if you want to pay reasonable prices for sodas or other sundries. (Sodas from hotel machines were $2/can!!) \r\nThe only thing we would have liked was a refrigerator and/or coffee maker in the room. \r\nWe would stay here again. Location was excellent.'
1,'So terrible we left!!!!','My husband and I booked a room in the Grand Hyatt in March of this year. We were going to stay 3 nights. Upon arrival the room wasn\'t ready. We were told to explore the city and they held our bags for us. The lobby was very nice with water falls. After spending some time shopping we returned and our room was ready. As we were being taken to our room I noticed that the hallway had a terrible stench. I thought it may be food but I could smell it through out the hallway as we were walking to the room. The room was very, very disappointing. First of all, it was extremely small, even by NY standards. The room was smelly. Maybe it was because it was smoked in, but it was strong enough to make me ill. I\'ve never experienced a smell like this and I travel a lot. I wasn\'t going to be able to sleep with that smell. In addition, the carpet, furniture and curtains were worn. The window ledge inside the room was dirty. It looked like it wasn\'t cleaned for quite some time. We went down to the lobby to let them know that we were leaving. They didn\'t even have an apology for us-----very poor customer service. They did, however, offer to move us to another room. We were afraid the condition would be the same so we left. We had to pay a nights stay anyway. (This hotel is very OVER-priced!) We went back to stay at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers to stay. We stayed at that hotel back in 2003 and had a wonderful experience so we knew it would be a safe bet and it was! Do not stay at the Grand Hyatt New York. You will be very disappointed ! I highly recommend the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers instead.... it is a very clean and classy hotel, great customer service too!'
2,'Not great','We checked in at 9pm with no queues.\r\nCons:\r\nWe were given our keys and that was it. The lady behind the desk didn’t tell us where the elevators were or anything. Also she didn’t tell us what floor we were on but by our room number we figured that out but for some people it might throw them off. Room is very old. Wallpaper looked damp and was coming off the wall in places. The heater is the room is not for the faint hearted to look at. Bed was okay. Bathroom was small. \r\nPros:\r\nLocation is very good. Shower is always warm and powerful.\r\nGeneral Info:\r\nI would advise booking another hotel but if your not fussy and can\'t get anywhere else cheaper in the area, then try this. They have wireless internet access on the ground floor only but there are no electrical sockets to plug in your laptop charger so you better have a good battery life. This costs $3 per hour. They have desktop computers with access to the internet. That is very good but costs $12 per hour.'
4,'Perfect CHoice','This is a great choice for tourists. It is centrally located with a quick and convenient cab stand out front. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. It is rated as a 3*, but I felt the quality was at least a 4*. I would definitely stay here again. It is good value compared to a lot of other NYC hotels.'
4,'Whats with the bad reviews?','What is with the bad reviews?! My mother, my aunt and myself stayed in the Pennslyvania in NYC in Nov 06 and I must say after reading some of the reviews I was terrified about what was waiting for us.........\r\nThe lobby of the Penn if just fantastic, the hotel also has a 24 hr cafe in the lobby which serves english tea! Very handy. The elevators are a little dated but there are plenty of them available and they are quite fast so you\'re never wating long! \r\nThe corridors leading to the hotel rooms are a little off putting because the hallways are dark and the carpet and doors are dated, this didnt really put me off thought because every floor was provided with an ice and soda machine. More than making up for it in my eyes!\r\nThe room was just fantastic, we where located on the 5th floor and overlooked madison sq gardens. The room itself was huge for an NYC hotel room, it comfortably fit two double beds a telephone table and lamp table and a big television stand! There was loads of space for our suitcases and plently of room to move around. There was even a mini hallway to the en suite with a wardrobe!!! \r\nThe bathroom was basic but clean and had shampoo, conditioner and a hairdryer. \r\nI was really massively pleased with the rooms which were undoubtably the cheapest and yet had everything you could want, they where clean, spacious and not lacking in any facility. \r\nI will definitly be staying in this hotle from now on and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends. My mother had previously visited New York and she commented that the rooms in the Milford Plaza where almost double the price and half the size! \r\nWho really cares if the carpet isnt the newest one available? All you need from a New York hotel is a place to catch a few hours sleep.......... \r\nenjoy your stay!'
3,'chaotic, but efficient','This hotel was located in a great area, right by times square. There is plenty to do, and if the weather is nice, you can walk around without paying for a cab.\r\nThe room was adequate, but beware: this hotel does change $30.00 for a rollaway bed, which is not typical in most Hilton\'s. We asked for a couple items to be brought to the room, and the front desk staff was very accommodating and brought them up right away.\r\nThe breakfast was overpriced at 30.00 per person, but that\'s typical at nicer hotels in NYC. \r\nOverall, this was a pleasant stay, esp if you are looking to stay in the times square area. There were sooo many people at this hotel it became chaotic using the elevator and trying to hail a cab, but eventually it all worked out.'
5,Awesome!!!,'We were there for 7 nights and what a great hotel spend the extra and get the suite it is worth it. The NewYorker is in the perfect spot easy to get around NYC and easy to find anything you need. The staff was friendly and always ready to help us out of towners find our way. Loke I said spend the extra on a suite and enjoy the view from the 38th floor like we did on our balcony.'
2,'Prepare to be claustrophobic!','WOW. These rooms were so tiny! My knees were bruised after sitting on the commode. The bathroom was so small!!!!. The room itself was almost like being on a cruise ship cabin...without the luxury...and it was smaller. I was given a room with a view. HA. The view was a window behind the bed. In order to see out of it I had to climb onto the back part of the bed and sort of hover to look out the window. While in the bed itself you could almost touch all 4 walls. The TV was hung on the wall in such an odd spot that you got a crick in your neck trying to watch it. The desk was minute and the chair was made for people under 5 ft tall and 100 lbs. It was just absurd. 19th floor and super noisy....poorly sealed windows.\r\nThe good: The bed was pretty comfortable. Hotel lobby and bar were fantastic...but a little dark. Close to Columbus Circle and Central Park.\r\nOverall: I would not stay here again. I think it was pricey and obviously super tiny. I am used to small room in NYC but this took it to the extreme.'
4,'Nice hotel for the price','Good location and nice sized room, all at a decent price.'
5,'Great hotel!','This was my 3rd time staying at the Affinia this year and I still loved it. The air conditioner worked wonderful which was awesome since it was over 100 degrees outside. This time we had a king size bed and it was super comfortable. I wanted a room with a refrigerator and so they gave us non renovated room but it had a whole kitchen which I like a lot. The first time we even had 2 bathrooms! That\'s unusual. They have lots of plugs which is great these days when you have cell phones and camera batteries to charge up every night. The kitchen even supplies you with dishes, enough for 2 people at least. \r\nThe price was really good too. (at least compared to most hotels in New York) Plus it\'s so convenient. It\'s right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. I know I will stay here again!\r\nThe only bad thing was that they were renovating the room upstairs above our room and we had to listen to the drills and the wires being pulled up through the walls but it was day time then. Not like we were trying to sleep through it all so that was OK.'
5,'La qualité Westin','Personnellement, je préconise la chaine Starwood à chaque fois que je voyage et que mes moyens me le permettent! J\'adore les heavenly beds et la qualité des Westin...Celui-ci, <westin Times Square a un emplacement de choix, soit en plein coeur de Times Square et de toutes les attractions principales de Manhattan. Vous y trouvez donc d\'excellents restos, donc Shulas Grill, où vous devez absolument aller car ca vaut la dépense :) Bref, j\'ai pratiquement que des bons commentaires à dire sur l\'établissement et sa situation géographique tout à fait géniale !'
4,'Great hotel for a week in NYC','My wife and I were very pleased with this hotel. For a week in NYC it is well positioned, being close to the Empire State building and a short walk to Time Square. The subway is right out front so you can get to any other part of the city easily. The room was very pleasant, well renovated and comfortable for the purpose of a place to stay when spending most of your time out and about. The diner offered good food at a good price and the staff in the bar were very friendly. All staff were pleasant and helpful. I\'d recommend this hotel.'
4,'What more could anyone possibly want, or need ??','Location, location, location.\r\nIn the heart of Manhatten - Times Square is Times Sqare, after all = Theatres, Restaurant Row, Subway station at your front door = pulse of New York right outside the front door.\r\nWe booked our room through New York International Auto Show Website = hint - Javits room tax must equate to area hotels offering reduced rates to support events at this very grand conference locaiton (?) - if you have done this much investigation why not see goto javitscenter.com and see what\'s up in terms of special conference rates through supporting website?? NYIAS was good - now been there and done that - went for our 25th Anniversary with buds - guys spent one afternoon at show while ladies hit Canal Street.\r\nBack to Hotel - rate included excellent continental breakfast complete with starbucks coffee, cappacino/expresso machine, hard boiled eggs, fresh fruit, pastry, juice, etc. etc. We only made one afternoon happy hour with free appys and free pour wine on honour system. Our room was completed with turn down service and chocolates; twin shower head; suite afforded everything anybody could possibly need with window wall and on and on. . . \r\nSure, front desk staff have attitude = it is NYC, afterall. Tip = do not eat in either W restaurants = Blue Fin is little more than a tourist trap and Shula\'s Steak House is about all that is wrong with New York = pompus, pretentious people who really believe they are something special (not you, their guest) and have that (gag me with a spoon) BIG New York attitude. Without a doubt the most overpriced meal I have ever eaten in a basement. . . stay away!!!!!!!!!\r\nIf you are thinking of visiting NYC do it NOW. Read in trade magazine that rack rates in Manhatten will be up to $800/night by next September (\'08). Stop dreaming - and don\'t blame the hotel or the City if you have a sour time = NYC is a world class destination that offers whatever it is you want + the people speak english, you can drink the water, and there is (literally) now a cop on every corner of Mahatten (noticable increase vs. our last visit nine years ago).\r\nWestin afforded us incredible value - we had an excellent trip!'
1,'Unconcerned Management and Staff of Thieves','I stay here each year I attend the ARF Conference in March. Unfortunately this time someone on the hotel staff stole my laptop right out of a private meeting room on the 7th floor. Security told us they had cameras to find the person but acted like they needed to go on their coffee break before they could do anything about it. We called and called and they\'ve never made an attempt to see who walked out of the meeting room with my laptop. The 7th floor is a floor of just meeting rooms, very little foot-traffic. We stepped out of the room for a few minutes and when we did the hotel staff delivered a UPS and Fedex box to the room. When we returned, the laptop was gone. Their attitude... well that\'s what we have insurance for. Not concerned at all that maybe someone of their staff is a thief who should be fired. Oh well... hopefully they read this and make an effort next time. Beware next time you leave anything valuable unattended in this hotel... even in your room!'
4,'Nice place to stay','This is a very nice place to stay if you are going to New York. The rooms are a little bit small, but they are nice. It is right in Time Square and it is not too expensive.'
2,'Very disappointing','We used to live in NY and came back for a weekend to see friends. The Park Central has a good location, and offered a decent rate. That\'s about the extent of the good.\r\nWhen we arrived, the front desk clerk, Angela, was incredibly rude. We were early, and she told us a room was ready. About 10 seconds later, she said that one of her fellow clerks had just booked it, so it wasn\'t. ...OK. Strangely disorganized. Then, she said she could check us in early. I asked how that would help (as in, if the room wasn\'t ready, what would it matter? simply curious, not rude at all) and she barked, I\'m TRYING to help you! She then insisted that I remove my ID from my wallet, though I was struggling to get it out, because she HAD to have it on the desk next to her rather than look at it through the plastic window. Doesn\'t seem like a big deal, but I\'ve stayed at a lot of hotels, and it was odd. We were guests, and she treated us like our presence was a massive inconvenience. A woman we spoke to later, whose name I didn\'t get, also needed to see ID but didn\'t seem to care that it was in my wallet.\r\nWe went to drop off our bags since we were going out for the afternoon and the room wasn\'t ready, and were told we had to pay to have them held, though we were guests at the hotel. As my husband said ... it\'s just chintzy. It just seems like they go out of their way to nickel-and-dime the guests.\r\nThe room was fine. No coffee maker, tiny shower, no extra blankets, etc. Completely bare-bones.\r\nThe elevators creaked - loudly - all day and night. Also, as other reviewers have stated, a 10-minute wait for them is more common than not. When I entered the hotel one day, someone was stuck in the elevator and maintenance was trying to get her out.\r\nA few other things. As we were waiting for the elevator (as usual), two employees were arguing loudly right next to us. Just very unprofessional in front of paying guests. The soda machine didn\'t work. Many of these things wouldn\'t be a big deal on their own, but combined, they just left a bad taste in our mouths. If you\'re so excited about NYC that all you care about is a good location, stay here. If you\'d like to be treated humanely in a place that doesn\'t seem to be in disrepair, don\'t. We\'d never stay here again.'
3,expensive/aggravating,'We stayed at the Marriott/Times Square for two nights 12/04. The rooms were nice. They were having big problems with the elevators, a real problem when check-in is on the 8th floor and your room is on the 20th and the gym is even further up. The gym is great- TV\'s on the treadmills. The water stopped running twice in two days for like an hour or two. One lady told me she hadn\'t had water in two days. No toilet, nothing. Room service left dirty dishes out in the hall for 24 hours. Valet is understandably expensive. It was like Grand Central Station in the drop-off area- absolutely packed all the time. Good location to go to the shows. Nice selection of both expensive and simple restaurants. I think some of the problems with the hotel are due to the anthill nature of New York.'
1,'Super duper stupid','Unfreundlich, inkompetentes Personal. Hatten Frühstück inklusive, wollten uns aber 70$ berechnen. Dinner Vouchers wurden ohne weiteres akzeptiert. Also wurde wieder eine halbe Stunde sinnlos in der tollen Stadt an der Rezeption verbracht, bis der Voucher akzeptiert wurde.\r\nAnsonsten sehr dunkles, lautes Hotel und unbrauchbar kleine Zimmer.'
1,'Hip, silly and pretentious!','Hudson Hotel is uber-hip, however the rooms are uber-small. The overall look was chic, but there needs to be practical amenities. There is substantially more leg room in an airplane lav than their bathrooms and the hooks don\'t even hold a towel, it was ridiculous really. The bar was trendy and the lobby cool, but the whole place was dark, which did annoy after a while. The check-in on Friday night was fine, super nice front desk person, however Saturday morning another person was at the desk and not so nice. We asked if breakfast was included and he said that he\'d check, he called reservation and no one picked up, so he said that he did not have an answer. We said that we really needed to know, and he suggested that we go and have breakfast and IF it were included, it would be deducted from the bill...not a solution, as we think that we have a right to know either way, so we are not stuck with an over priced hotel breakfast. So we pressed again, he disappeared and came back minutes later and without looking us in the eye, simply and arrogantly said no and went on with his work. He needs some basic customer service training and a new attitude, it\'s not difficult to say I\'m sorry, but the price you paid does not include breakfast or some other gracious explanation. We could have moved beyond the small room, (but only slightly, as it really was ridiculous), but we can never move beyond arrogant poor service!'
3,'Small room','Hudson Hotel has a unique lobby entrance, as well as some decent bar/lounge options on the lobby floor (The Library) as well as the Sky Terrace. Overall, the hotel lobby area exudes a hip atmosphere. Unfortunately the positive highlights of the Hudson Hotel end at the lobby elevators though. My room was on the 15th floor. The hallways looked cheap, bare and factory-like. I stayed in a King deluxe and the room itself was extremely small. Views were of the interior terrace and of other room windows in the hotel. I could barely move around the room without knocking into something. The bed was uncomfortable and too short. The bathroom was the size of a closet and the bath tub looked like it had been cut in half. I would only recommend staying at this hotel if you are on a short-term trip and if you are traveling alone. Otherwise, stay clear of the Hudson Hotel. Fortunately, I got my reservation through a deal on Jetsetter and only played $111.'
2,'posizione imbattibile ma hotel vecchissimo','è vicinissimo a times square, nel cuore di manhattan, servito da metro e treni, solo per quello vale i soldi, ma non fatevi ingannare dalla lussuosissima hall: camere vecchissime, moquette marcia e puzzolente, rubinetti che gocciolano, sporchissimo, finestre che non vengono pulite da secoli, non toccatele, prendete il tetano!\r\nla coda per il check in è eterna a tutte le ore, potete fare l\'express check out buttando le chiavi in una scatola, ma se volete depositare i bagagli, solo a pagamento, vi dovete comunque rifare tutta la fila!!!!'
4,'Great Location','The hotel had a great location.The rooms are a good size for New York standards.\r\nThe hotel is like a zoo on weekends.We had access to the Concierge Lounge (which is closed from Friday and only reopens Sunday at 17.00), so you will have to use the hotel restaurant which gets rather crowded for breakfast.Choose a weekday for your stay if you don\'t like crowds.'
3,'Great location for getting around NewYork','This hotel is located right next to Times Square so great for walking around and venturing into the NewYork streets.\r\nIf you are wanting to see a show on Broadway you are only a few streets away so again very easy to get around.\r\nTimes Square is a busy place so expect a lot of things happening and things to see.\r\nThe staff were all very helpful and friendly.\r\nThe only two things I\'d mention are that our room was near some kind of extractor fan which was a little noisy but it got turnd off in the night.\r\nWe also were not too keen on the cooked breakfasts and preferred to venture out into the city for food instead.\r\nOverall a great location, helpful staff, and good hotel for discovering NewYork.'
5,'Excellent hotel!','We stayed here between 23rd-28th of March 2007 and thought it was absolutely fantastic, and dont have a bad word to say about it! The location is perfect if you want to see the major sights of new york. The empire state building is around the corner, Times Square is a few hundred yards down the road and it is basically opposite Madisson Sq Garden. All these are within walking distance. Shopping on 5th avenue is around a 10 minute walk. The hotel itself is even better than it looks in photos. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with kitchenette and sofa bed in the living room, which was fantastic. Although we did not spend much time in the hotel other than in the mornings and evenings it was very quiet. The room was clean and extremely comfortable and I would say the luxury of the hotel was probably an equivalent 4* in Europe. Would definately recommend this hotel, it was the best in the area for location and quality. The staff were exceptionally helpful and we will certainly be returning there. The only downside of the rooms would be that the bathrooms were quite small, but the bedrooms and living room make up for this. Overall perfect hotel. Would recommend this hotel 100\% and i\'m not sure how those who wrote negative reviews came to those opinions!'
5,'Absolutely brilliant hotel, amazing location.','Well, I stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights on the 19th May 2009, we got an upgraded room as I work for a travel agency, and was on the 37th floor. The view was amazing, we have 3 big windows, the two at the front you could clearly see the Empire State building, Madison Square Gardens and the window on our right, was facing towards the Statue of Liberty and you could also see the Hudson river.\r\nThe service from everyone was brilliant, right from the bell boys to the check in desk and customer services. \r\nThe Tick Tock Diner was excellent and very clean, which is connected to the hotel and open to the public, the food was amazing and at a reasonable price too. \r\nThe location of the hotel was excellent, ten minutes walk up 34th street you passed lots and lots of different shops and you reached Times Square. One block away was Macy\'s and Penn Station was just across the road. Empire State was 3 blocks away.\r\nWe got the hop on - hop off bus and I would recommend it as it\'s a great way to see all the sights in New York. \r\nI will definatly be returning to this hotel and would recommend it to everyone. It is great for singles, couples, families, groups.\r\nI loved it!'
4,'Cozy and comfortable','Beautiful lobby to wait for whatever, lots of nice seating. Fun place to stay. Starbucks right across the street. Security at the elevators to check room keys. That\'s important. Art deco 1920s atmosphere and decor. Such a great value for being in Times Square. I stay here when I go to NYC.'
4,'Midtown Manhatten','This is a fabulous hotel if you want to be near the Lincoln Center, the Theatre District and Central Park. All are easy walking distance. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are clean with wood trim and white curtains, and are small. Our bathroom door did not shut and they did not fix it during our stay. \r\nThis is not a hotel for anyone who needs light. The concept is designed like Alice in Wonderland and it is dark, with low ceilings and green lights in the hallways, and dark reception area. The breakfast costs $21.00, so go outside to a nearby cafe for eggs etc under $10.00. There is no room service or no place for coffee or tea in the evening, so again - you need to eat somewhere else. Apparently this could change? It would be expensive and small for a family, so this is young couple fare or solo travel.'
3,'Very dated in rooms, public areas stunning, noisy pipes!','The entrance to the hotel made us expect great things as it\'s beautiful in its design. In the room we stayed in, however, it was totally different. Room itself was a reasonable size with comfortable bed, the room was also clean. No tea or coffee facilities were available in the room which was a little disappointing. Sever lack of anywhere to plug in phone and camera chargers. Iron and board provided, although iron couldn\'t have reached the board by the time we found a hidden socket. Bathroom very very compact and dated. Light switch only on the mirror as a shaving light but to access this you had to try not to burn yourself on the main waterpipe which was hotter than the sun! At approx 5am each morning the heating pipes starting clanking and banging, this didn\'t stop until around 9am. The rooms were very dated and in serious need of upgrading, this seemed to be going on in some of the rooms around ours. Breakfast left a lot to be desired, only available via a ticket system in the diner next door. We couldn\'t order from the main menu, just a limited choice which the hotel obviously set for the price. The main attractions for this hotel are the price and the location. Just 50yds from Times Square from one exit, and directly onto Broadway the other.'
5,'Times square','Stayed at the Westin in times square in May 2012. This is a fantastic place too stay it\'s right in the hustle and bustle of time square, but when you step into the hotel, you feel like time square is miles away, it\'s such a relaxing ambiance You will want to return again.'
3,'Pre-Wedding Trip','The Hotel was centrally located. The accomodations were fine. Small room, but walking distance to all attractions...'
5,'Service Service Service!','I\'m from Pennsylvania and I had a room here in NYC for valentines day for me and my fiancé. First thing I noticed was that my room was a little too small for my liking so I spoke to the front desk about possibly upgrading. I can\'t say enough about the front desk attendant. Her name was Shpresa I remember. She even helped us find a great italian restaurant in the area that I could wine and dine my fiancé. The food was great and affordable. Oh! And can I just say the view from the room was amazing (overlooking times square) !!! Park Central might just have earned a new regular. Cheers\r\nP.S. The bed, super comfy'
5,'Great rooms, service, and attitude!','I stayed for a week along with other coworkers and we all agree that this hotel was great! It\'s in a great location and the rooms were great along with a great staff!'
2,'Dog Toilet!!!','We stayed in this hotel a few years ago, but i was reading some of your reviews and felt I had to have my say.\r\nThe hotel IS cheap and nasty, and I wouldnt go back there, especially after watching a \'Top 10 Best\' programme on the Discovery channel recently. The hotel wasnt the best in New York but it did come 2nd in the list as having one of the best bathrooms in the world-not for humans but for DOGS. Apparently the annual dog show is held there and the organisors book an entire ballroom just so the dogs can crap on the floor.\r\nEnough said.'
3,'Pennsylvania Hotel, NYC','To sum up the 7 night stay in this hotel I would start by saying this is an excellent location (middle Manhattan) with classic art deco design. However, I would state that the interior is a bit tired looking especially in the corridors which resemble scenes from the Coen Brothers\' film \'Barton Fink\'. Furthermore, we had a decent size room on floor 16 but the view from the window didn\'t offer much other than the neighbouring building and some rooftops. This is concrete jungle New York, so what do you expect? Nice original valet doors minus the card reader of course. Overall, good stay enjoyable city break and wouldn\'t mind staying again if I ever back to the city.'
4,'Bellissimo design e ottima posizione. Pulito. Stanza e bagno piccoli.','Ci sono stato 10 notti per capodanno 2011. Mi sono trovato molto bene. \r\nParticolarmente interessante ill design della hall, del gardino, del bar e del ristorante.\r\nPur avendo un inglese molto elementare ho trovato cortesia e disponibilità del personale. \r\nStanze e bagno abbastanza piccoli. Sembra una bella cabina di una barca. Pulizia giornaliera. \r\nPosizione magnifica. 3 minuti metrò, 5 central park, 10 min time square.\r\nL\'aspetto peggiore sono state le finestre non perfettamente isolate; tuttavia a questo ho posto rimedio isolando gli spifferi con della carta igienica. \r\nCi tornerei. Speriamo'
5,'Great location, in the middle of things.','Our second visit to NYC found us on a return stay at his hotel. This 40+ floor hotel is top notch, with open, glassed elevators, surprisingly spacious rooms, restaurants, in various price ranges, gift shops, a consierge very willing to assist in getting theater tickets, maps, or answer any questions you may have and a great fitness center. The View restaurant sits on the top floor, with revolving views of the city. After 8 pm there is a cover. Prices begin at $30 . Ratings score it high for views, but mid to low range for quality of food and service. We opted NOT to dine there, this trip. \r\nWe stayed on the 37th floor, overlooking Time\'s Square...facing ABC studios. Granted directly across from us was a large office building, but the wall of floor to ceiling windows allowed for great views of the down town, (especially at night with all the lights) , \r\nLocation is literally around the corner from Times Square. The Roxy Deli, a McDonald\'s, ABC studios and the TCKTs discount booth for Broadway show tickets are all right there, in that block, along with favorite street vendors ranging from hot dog, peanuts, and pretzel vendors along with purse and scarf salesmen. Great energy and something going on in every direction. Super location, near theaters, popular restaurants...open late for dining, after the shows, too. A block from Junior\'s famous Cheese cake restaurant, Sardi\'s, to name a few.\r\nSuggest a stay here if you want to be in the center of it all.'
2,'Nice Hotel But Erratic Service','I stayed in the hotel with my wife for 9 nights from 21st to 30th December 2004. We really enjoyed our Christmas stay, it\'s a nice hotel but there are a few problems.\r\nThe heavenly robe we had when we arrived didn\'t look very clean. We got a second robe sent up which was better. The shower was frequently tepid in the mornings; it would have been kind to describe it as warm - certainly far from \'heavenly\'. I\'ve been at remote Island hotels in Greece with more hot water!\r\nThe maid service was very erratic. Maybe we weren\'t tipping her enough. On the day we arrived we had 2 frosted drinking beakers, 2 water glasses, 1 Starbucks paper cup for the coffee machine and two wine glasses. On subsequent days we\'d find that we\'d get a variation of these but never the full compliment. The low margin was when we were left with just two wineglasses and one Starbucks coffee cup. Also I never saw Decaf coffee refills for the coffee maker. Although Camomile tea was always there (untouched from the first day) only about 3 out of 9 days did we get any regular tea. We also had to ask for a spare toilet tissue after we were left with just a few sheets on the roll and no spare. This should be the first thing the maid checks in my opinion - the last thing you need is be phoning down to reception in flagrante! :O) \r\nPressing Service Express can be an interesting experience. At least three times I got no reply what so ever in the middle of the day. I was on the verge of going down 26 floors to reception to get an answer.\r\nThere were definite plus points. The heavenly bed is just that. Heavenly! We\'ve had them before at other Starwood properties and they are a definite reason to keep coming back. Was nice to receive two newspapers daily and a good range of TV channels including HBO and (especially nice for us Brits) BBC America. The fixtures and fitting are all very good and a higher standard than most hotels we have stayed it - I guess it\'s still quite new. I also appreciated a decent sized safe deposit box in the room which was big enough to store my laptop and plenty of other stuff besides.\r\nThe location is good, I think to call it Times Square is slightly misleading although it\'s a short walk up from the 42nd or 43rd street entrances. With it being so mad at that time of year in Times Square it was almost a relief to be able to bypass the square and walk along 8th Ave to cut up to 7th/Broadway further up/down. Bar 10 was inviting enough and we enjoyed the spicy nibbles.\r\nOverall I think we expected slightly better service but it was a busy time of year and over the 9 days I\'ll let them get away with a few foibles, except maybe the shower temperature! The rooms are compact but well featured. If I had one of those beds at home I\'d be late for work every day!\r\nAndy'
2,'Trust the reviews, don\'t stay here.','I\'ve stayed here 8 or 10 times over the last 15 years. I stay here because a convention takes place every other July in the hotel. It is PURELY for convenience.\r\nThe hotel sucks. The rooms are moldy, have holes in the walls, mattresses and pillows are uncomfortable, and everything smells like smoke --- even though it hasn\'t been a smoking hotel for years. The rooms are mostly clean, but it\'s borderline. The elevators make unsettling noises when you use them, and they are slow. The lobby is frequently overrun by foreigners who couldn\'t afford a better hotel.\r\nThere\'s no wifi in the rooms. The A/C in the rooms barely keep up with the summer heat.\r\nOk, the location is pretty good.\r\nStay somewhere else, you\'ll be glad you did.'
4,'Pretty Good','I was pleasantly surprised at our stay after reading some reviews.\r\nWe arrived at 11:30 am with two young children, with the hotel check in time being 3 pm. While I gave my car to the valet, my spouse asked if we could check in. She was told our room wasn\'t ready. I travel for business frequently, so when arrived at the front desk, I asked someone else. He called up to housekeeping and found us a suite that was available on the 44th floor. When the incredible friendly bell hop got us to our room, I was happy to see a very large suite that fit two double beds and two cribs. The room was typically furnished for a Hilton. Absolutely fine. \r\nThe doors on the rooms on the 44th Floor have a soft close. You can\'t slam these doors. Although the hotel was busy, I did not hear anyone else in the hallways or next door.\r\nThe executive loung was very nice and better than most concierge lounges I have been in (though the drinks during cocktail hour are expensive). The continental breakfast was very good. Lots of fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, cereal. Get there early to get a table. \r\nWe went to the marketplace restaurant. The service was very friendly and they catered to our children. The children menu was reasonably priced, the regular menu was overpriced. \r\nBassed on our experience, I\'d go back. We stayed at the W Union Square without kids last month and the Hilton was much better.\r\nWhen we left, I did see a long line at the check in or check out counter. Also long lines for taxis. Fortunately, we did not experience lines at all when we checked in.'
5,'Perfect for family stay in superb location','Fantastic proximity to Penn Station and room was sooooooo clean.Brand new carpet and two wonderfully clean and stylish bathrooms.True the sirens on the fire trucks were noisy but hey- we were in central Manhattan not an ocean retreat!\r\nKitchen really handy but we ate out or had take aways.Two lovely bakery cafes one right opposite and one on next block called Europa Cafe .Fab breakfasts and snacks in both . Found staff friendly and efficient. King Kong cuddly toy on bed was a nice touch but then realised it cost $20-we left it . On 23rd floor and kids loved that,we did request it.\r\nWas really concerned by some reports I had read but our experience was wonderful and I loved the space this place offered as a retreat from the full on experience that is New York. Did not pay for WiFi as this is a rotten hidden charge that I personally resent as so many really low cost places manage to include in the room cost . Hope Mr Affina is reading this .'
2,'Whacked with surcharges right from the start','We were bombarded with surcharges right at the start at check in. They said that our reservations were for only two which meant a charge of $15/per night extra for a lousey rollaway bed. Next, an additional $19/ night for parking as we have an SUV (saturn Vue) which is considered a larger vehicle. The broom closet we stayed in with the roll away opened up left NO room to get around unless you like acrobatics. The room had NO view except the industrial view of an alley. For the money spent I could/ should have gotten a room at the Millenium or another four star hotel around times square.\r\n I often stayed here 25+ years ago with family on weekend trips and this is definetley not the same hotel as I remember. \r\n Very disappointed as this mini vacation was a reward for my daughter for doing well in school, next time (next year) I wont be so cheap minded and get a better place right from the start.'
1,Péssimo!,'O Hotel é enorme, qualquer um entra e sai. O carpete do quarto é imundo. As paredes também. Parece hotel de filme de terror. \r\nInfelizmente já me hospedei mais de 3 vezes lá pois ia a trabalho e a empresa que pagava. Uma vez os elevadores quebraram de madrugada e um segurança passou em todos os andares com um megafone avisando que não dava para descer de elevador. Imagina o susto das pessoas acordando de madrugada com esse barulho. \r\nOutra vez deixei um fio de cabelo na pia para testar a limpeza. Quand voltei ele estava no mesmo lugar. Nojento.'
3,'Good Location, Not Worth Your Money','We stayed at the Marquis in March, 2004. We were amazed at the great location of the hotel- we walked out and we were on Times Square. Plus we got there and there were no standard rooms left, so they upgraded us for free to a Times Square view. But overall, the hotel is not worth your money. You are paying for the location and that\'s pretty much it. The rooms are nothing special, they\'re just average, standard sized rooms. We were on the 42nd floor, but we could still hear the street sounds which was annoying when we were trying to fall asleep. The elevators take forever to get, so plan on allowing 15-20 minutes extra just to catch one. The staff was very unhelpful and not incredibly friendly. We asked the concierge about how to get to Ground Zero and it took her 20 minutes to first of all find the map and then figure out herself how to explain to us how to get there. You\'d think that was a pretty common question! But it did have a great fitness room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Times Square and it had a great restaurant/lounge at the top of the hotel that overlooked all of New York\'s skyline. I would probably stay there again if I got a good deal, but I definately would not pay $300 a night again.'
5,'Perfect ny hotel','Great location close to every mid town location.times square , Central Park, museums radio city and more. Clean updated rooms great service. Everyone who worked there really cared about every meed. A little pricey but worth it!'
4,'Good for the Price and Location','After reading reviews on this site, I was a little apprehensive, but found my stay quite satisfactory.\r\nWe visited just before New Year\'s Eve, so peak tourist season, but the lady at check in was extremely helpful and kindly changed our room type without any fuss as I was travelling with family, but no twin rooms were available online. Out of three or four desk staff I spoke to, all but one were very friendly and helpful. The other was quite rude and made it clear that my query was not worth his time - even looking away from me across the lobby as he answered.\r\nI was very happy with the rooms for the price we paid and the time of year we travelled. The bathroom had a few cracks in the bath (shower) enamel and sink - I would recommend shower shoes and slippers, and a few spots on the ceiling, but certainly nothing that made the room unliveable. The phone in the room didn\'t work. The amount of housekeeping varied by day, which was more a curiosity than a problem.\r\nThe location is absolutely fantastic. Walking distance to Times Square and many other tourist locations. Close to Penn Station and the Long Island Rail Road (from the airport). Nice views out the windows, could see the chrysler building and others from our room.\r\nNo wifi in the rooms - you need to go to the lobby to get access and it requires credit card payment. Desk staff have instruction sheets upon request. There is also a computer room, although I did not use it. There is also lots of free wifi spots in NYC, including at starbucks, macy\'s and other locations. I was able to connect to the Penn Station wifi from the room which allows 5 minutes free trial a day and then further access at a cost.\r\nThe breakfast included with our room was very nice - coffee, orange juice and a pastry from the hotel cafe.\r\nFantastic location, acceptable accomodation and very good pricing. Bookings may be done online, but pricing seems to vary depending on how close to your trip you book. Travelling as a student, I would recommend this hotel, although it does definitely lack the polish that other hotels may offer, so it will not suit everyone.'
5,'A cool hotel for adults','The Westin is a super combination of cool and at the same time grown-up. It has all of the amenities of a luxury hotel in an A location with the vibe of hip. Rooms have Apple computers and the internet which makes doing business in the rooms that much easier. It is the only place I enjoy staying in the city, offering value and a bit of excitement at the same time. Westin staff is incredibly helpful as well.'
4,'Ideal para tu visita a la gran manzana','Hotel muy comodo, personal muy amable (hablan español), esta cerca del Empire State Biulding, del Madison Square Garden. Metro en la puerta del Hotel. Recomendable para tu visita a la gran manzana.'
1,'Awful. Cheesy. Not worth it. Oh, and we found a cockroach.','I\'ve been dying to find time all week to write this review. Everyone needs to know just how awful our experience was at The Hudson Hotel.\r\nSo my husband and I just wasted close to $700 on two nights at this super cheesy hotel. It\'s a wannabe see and be scene hotel, which obviously spent time, resources, and money on their lobby and three bars, because the hotel rooms are horrendous. When you walk down the dark, gray hallways you begin to feel like you\'re in an insane asylum. \r\nBut let me take a step back. When we first arrived at the hotel, we stood in one of several lines for almost 40 minutes, waiting to check in. My husband and I noticed that almost every single person talking to someone behind the desk was complaining about something. We couldn\'t believe how long it was taking to simply check in.\r\nWhen we finally got to the desk, the person behind it didn\'t even apologize for our wait. He, like the rest of the staff, looked bored, unenthusiastic, and grim. What a way to welcome your guests! From the doormen (aspiring models, I assume?) and concierge, to the check-in staff, everyone just seemed clueless.\r\nAnyway, we got our room key and walked down the aforementioned hallways, which looked straight out of a horror film. I get it—you\'re trying to be minimalistic. Then we got to our room, which you couldn\'t really call a room—more like a broom closet. The bathroom is obscenely tiny, so anyone over 54 should avoid this place at all costs.They put us on the 4th floor, where you couldn\'t avoid the horrendous traffic noise outside. I couldn\'t sleep the first night. \r\nTo top things off, we found a dead COCKROACH in our bathroom. We asked to change rooms the next day and again, the woman behind the desk gave us no apologies when they upgraded us to another crappy room. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!\r\nIf you\'re a tourist who plans to party all weekend, this place is definitely for you. (But don\'t have the wine at the bar. Their selection is awful.) You\'ll also be sure to run into drunk people in the elevator. It\'s like being in Vegas!\r\nOverall, it was the one and only blemish to our trip to NYC.'
5,'One of the Best! And I am picky!','This was a dream, after cancelling our reservations at the Radisson in Milwaukee after the first night (that should have been called the RAT-ison)! The Palmer House was classy and clean. Beautiful decor and rich history (I enjoyed watching the Palmer House history channel at the hotel). Wish they would publish a book for us history enthusiasts. The staff was very friendly for the most part (for a big city anyway), except for one of the operators who obviously needed some Xanax. At any rate, next time I\'m in Chicago, I will definitely stay here. I\'m a solid Hilton patron now for sure. Thought the valet parking was a little pricey at $62.00 a day, but for room price at $150.00, I guess it evened out. It was right on the loop, so you can take the Red Line anywhere (Navy pier, etc.) and it\'s walking distance from the Willis Tower (former Sears Tower). You can buy Red Line tickets at the CVS just a few blocks away. I would buy an all day pass or a 2-day pass.'
4,'Vale a pena pela localização.','Fiquei hospedado 8 dias neste hotel em março deste ano. A localização é excelente, há meia quadra da times square. O ruim é que nao tem café da manhã incluído, assim como em vários outros (se nao forem todos) hotéis na cidade. Tem padaria, starbucks, Md donalds perto o q supre essa carência. E tem um homem na recepção bastante mal humorado! Uma coisa q me incomodou muito lá foram as gorjetas. Pra cada serviço no hotel vc tinha q desembolsar (tirar mala do taxi, levar pra recepção, leva-lá pro quarto...) e nao era 1 ou 2 dólares nao. Eles reclamavam, pedindo mais! Com isso eu nao concordei.'
4,'Highly Recommend','Try to get the one-bedroom suite. It has ample space for a family and this hotel is centrally located. Nice touches like walking kit, pillow menu and comfort hour (where you can borrow a nintendo wii, maps, ipods) I could go on and on about how they go out of their way to make you feel comfy. Quite surprising the extras!'
4,'NO HOT WATER!','We had no hot water our first night in the hotel. What bothered me was that when we checked in at 6:30 P.M. they did not inform us of this. I needed a shower after touring the (filthy but exciting) streets of New York all day and being out till 1:00 A.M. That\'s when we saw the letter on our desk in the room informing us of the situation! If they had told us at check-in we would have requested to stay at another hotel location. The hot water was fixed by morning and the rest of our stay was great. Next time I will add this basic question to our itinerary--Is there hot water?!'
1,'Very Poor Customer Service','We had a couple issues with our stay at the Crowne Plaza. I understand it was a very busy time (Thanksgiving weekend) but after my complaint, the handling of it was utterly ridiculous. The coffee in our room was never replenished. One time, upon asking housekeeping for some, she replied we put two in every room. This may seem pretty minor, but more is coming. The last morning of our stay, my mother ordered breakfast from a outside restaurant to be deliverd. She talked to front desk, more than one occasion, to make sure that it could be deliverd to our room. They said yes. This was a surprise from her. That morning, we get a call saying food was waiting downstairs. I go down, can not find it. I ask the help desk. They did not know where it is. I go back upstairs to call the contact number, from the restaurant, that my mother had given me. The delivery man was at the hotel waiting, I was told. I went back down. I saw security and they directed me to the man. He said that he had been waiting 30 minutes for me. I had only gotten the call 15 minutes before I found him.\r\nUpon checking out, we called 45 minutes ahead for someone to get our luggage. No one showed up. I went downstairs and asked the bell-boy desk. I am told they are on the way. I get my car from valet. My husband calls me and says he is still waiting. I ask again, I am told they are on the way. More time goes by, my husband comes down to get a luggage cart and is told he can not take it. The man tells him someone is on the way. Long story short, my husband and son begin to bring our bags down in two trips. This ended about a hour and 45 minutes from when I first called. I can not begin to tell you how many people we saw coming and going with luggage in that time. I called and complained the night we got home. I was told by Adam , they he would have Barry contact me as soon as possible. Days went by, I sent a email to Adam. I was again told that Barry was going to contact me. When he did, he said that he was going to add points to my Priority rewards card, enough for 1 free night at the CP or 2 free nights at Holiday Inn Express. Days went by, did not happen. I called Adam again with my Rewards number. Did not see the addition on my card? Emailed Adam again, his reply was that he was going to see that it was taken care of. It is January 31 and this problem was never rectified. Wow....they have terrible customer service. Do not say you are going to do something and do not bother doing it. When I called initially, I was expecting anything, I just wanted them to be aware that this happened. He should not of offered a solution, if it was not going to be followed through. They DO NOT treat all customers the same. We are a military family, on a budget, that used our government discount. If we were paying $1000. for a deluxe room, rather than $400 for a standard, I can bet you, our luggage would have been carried down. Our business was not even important enough for a call back. Thank you guest service management at CP!!!'
4,'Great location!','My husband and I visited NY for a week. The hotel was good - and yes, the rooms were small - but honestly, how long to you spend in your room? I agree with the other reviewer - the plumbing is VERY noisy!! If someone in an adjacent room flushes the toilet in the middle of the night, you WILL be woken from your sleep! The room was comfy and the bed and bed linen very good quality (something I will NOT compromise on!). Lovely little packs in the bathroom with 2 x soaps, 1 x moisturiser, 1 x shower cap, 1 x shampoo and 1 x conditioner and these are replenished daily so there\'s no need to take your own products. The chambermaids were lovely - especially Rosa who was very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is perfectly located for all the local attractions - Penn Street Station across the road - Macy\'s round the corner - Time Square ten minutes away. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms - but there are Dunkin\' Donuts, Starbucks and a 7 Eleven thirty seconds from the hotel. A good tip - if you need any information - DON\'T GO TO THE INFORMATION DESK!! The staff who manned this desk on EVERY occasion we had to ask something - had absolutely no clue - and we were ALWAYS referred to the reception desk - Grrr!! So we soon learned our lesson! LOL! We had breakfast a couple of mornings at the Tick Tock Diner which is attached to the hotel and can be accessed from the lobby - beware - HUGE delicious portions!! If you have a late breakfast there, you won\'t need any lunch! In all we had a blast in New York! We walked miles and miles - so sensible shoes are a must!'
4,'Fantastic location','The hotel is art deco in appearance, but so very iconic. The lobby is looking a little tired but you feel as though you are back in time, very atmospheric. You have probably seen pictures of the famous red sign illuminated against the New York skyline.\r\nThe rooms are spacious and clean. The beds are comfortable. Wifi is available throughout the hotel. There is a diner attached to the hotel for great value breakfasts, eggs over easy, BLTs etc, typical New York fayre. More substantial meals are also available.\r\nHowever, the best part about staying here is the location. Just a five minute walk to The Empire State Building in one direction, five minutes to Times Square in another and five minutes to the Hudson River and boat trips around Manhatten.\r\nI will definitely stay here again the next time I am in New York'
4,'Better than expected','Some NY based colleagues were not too sure about the Grand Hyatt, but I booked anyway. Check in was very speedy and efficient (quickest I\'ve ever experienced), general interior was fine, although lobby was being re-built. Room was compact, no mini bar or coffee making facilities (this was major downside to me). Very clean. No view whatsover, but guess this varies by room. Internet access via WifI (extra charge). They had an in-hotel shop for stuff like beer, wine, deli etc. which was reasonably priced - an excellent idea, and one I\'ve not seen anywhere else. Another first was in room toothpaste, which helped due to liquid restrictions for air-travel.'
2,'Staff were forgetful and annoying','Room was ok, but the only problem was a plug socket hanging off the wall, it took 3 days to get it fixed as the reception staff forgot to tell the engineer. Keycards kept breaking. Apart from that the cleaners were very good and kept our room very clean. For all you people who want a brew they don\'t have a kettle (what is with that) but there is a shop called dannys next to it that you can get one.'
4,'Higher floors have good rooms','We had one of the good rooms on a high floor and it was excellent. Was a good view from up there too. Location is great and breakfast was decent. Staff was helpful. All in all, a fair priced Manhattan hotel is a good location. No bargain but you get what you pay for.'
4,'Great location','I stayed here in August 2009 with family on a visit to NY and the location was fantastic, right in the centre of everything. The hotel was perfect for our needs- basically to be a comfortable and clean place to come back to after a day of sightseeing. I\'d definitely return here if I were visiting NY again.'
2,'Not so Grand Hyatt NY','We stayed at the Grand Hyatt NY for 2 weeks and expected our stay to be well above average seeing as it is part of the Hyatt chains. We were wrong! \r\nOur room was on the 18th floor and we had a view of a high rise, which was to be expected as it is New York City after all and there are high rise building everywhere ;) The windows of the rooms are mirrored so the opposite people in the buildings could not see into our room. This was the least of our problems believe me...\r\nThe first thing we noticed was mould growing in a corner of the ceiling near the aircon/heating system and also the paint had started to peel away I guess due to the moisture here. We were going to asked to be moved however I wasn\'t sure that they had other rooms as most if the US Open Tennis players were also staying there too.\r\nWe also noticed no mini-fridge or minibar. We rang the front desk only to be told that this did not come standard and that you had to request for one to be sent to the room at a charge! I was certain that I read on their site that minibar/mini fridge was included in the room to which the staff member told me she\'d send one complimentary.\r\nWe also had to request bathrobes and slippers (not so much of a hassle, it was just weird that this was also not already in the room considering that this was stated on their site).\r\nAmongst other things our room wasn\'t clean properly everyday, the walls were thin and we could hear people snoring in the next rooms and people walking down the hallways. The staff were not that helpful (but we also found this throughout Midtown...we would always get blank stares, ignored or replies such as I don\'t know or that\'s not my job!) which was also a huge disappointment when you asked them for something. Everyone passed the buck and unfortunately we had to endure this for 2 week!!! Another thing was the draining system. The drain in the bathtub would clog and your feet would be in a pool of dirty water while you showered until about half way during your shower where most of it would drain away. And at times the toilet would also not flush properly too!! \r\nMy suggestion to you is to stay somewhere downtown or away from the centre of Manhattan. We received excellent service from retail and food industry as soon as we left Midtown (such as in Greenwich Village, SoHo and also in Brooklyn). Yes staying Midtown was handy to get to Uptown and Downtown with ease, but the NYC Subway and bus systems are so good and so fast that it shouldn\'t take you long to get from one end of NYC to the other (PS- Subway MTA MetroCards are the way to go. We got a 7 Day unlimited pass for USD$27 and it was gold. You can use it on buses and subway trains all day. Make sure it\'s not the 7 Day MetroCard USD$20 as this is not unlimited, and made of thin paper card. It just has USD$20 worth of credit and you have 7 days to use it in. What you want is the $27 UNLIMITED MetroCard which is made of thin plastic.)\r\nSorry to get off track...this Hyatt did not live up to it\'s reputation of silver service. In general our room left a bad taste in our mouths and also in our noses! We have paid less at other Hyatts and received a much better service! So no excuses Grand Hyatt NY, will not be returning there ever again.'
5,'My favourite, by miles','I also stayed in the Novotel Times Square, and the Westin kicked butt on the following:\r\nAwesome room, with an upgrade\r\nGreat checkin - letting me in the room at 10am when I was so underslept I was going to pass out\r\nSTUNNING rooms with iPod dock\r\nThey gave me free internet\r\nThey had a problem with my bar fridge shutting, but none the less it didn\'t matter. The staff were always awesome and helpful with information. I\'d stay here next time im in NYC.'
4,'Great staff, really beautiful hotel','My fiance and I were driving across country to attend a friends wedding and we decided to stop here for a night as neither of us had ever been to Chicago.\r\nI can\'t speak on the price of the rooms as our reservations were made as a gift for us by family but I must tell you, this hotel is wonderful!\r\nWe drove from Connecticut and arrived at the Palmer House right after check in time had begun. I can tell you, after driving for 17 hours straight, we looked a fright, but the staff never blinked an eye or treated us as if we were out of place. Everyone from the valet to the bellman to the front desk attendant was professional and kind and made us feel welcome before we even checked in. \r\nThe hotel is within walking distance of a number of shopping centers and restaurants and only a few blocks from the famous Bean in Millenium Park. \r\nThere were two restaurants at the hotel which had menu items we\'d heard of but after reading the descriptions, felt all of the recipes were trendy and obscure and in all honesty a little intimidating-designed for people with a very broad palette and for the prices, my fiance and I were not about to try out anything we weren\'t sure we would recognize let alone enjoy so we ate outside the hotel. \r\nThe rooms themselves are a standard size and the bathroom, while a little small (it was a squeeze to have two people in there at the same time) was very clean and beautifully decorated. \r\nWe were on the 20th floor and could hear the subway (which ran right beside the hotel) from our rooms which I\'m sure would bother some folks, but we found the distant hum to be quiet plesant and soothing. \r\nI would definitely recomment this hotel to anyone looking to spend and night or two in the area. The rooms did not have mini fridges or microwaves and the price for connecting to the internet is quiet high so I wouldn\'t recommend it for a lengthy stay, but if you have the chance to stay a night here, do so, you won\'t regret it.'
4,'I loved looking out my windows at Times Square','I\'m so used to NYC hotels that have no view or a view of another hotel room, that when i opened the curtains in my room I just staired out at the scene for quite some time. From my bed, i could see the lights of Times Square and the Empire State Building. And that bed was very comfortable and the room was a nice size and well appointed. Everything was clean and well kept. The tub appeared to have had some anti slip affixed and then removed - the result of which appeared and felt under foot to be lumps of plaster. Not bad for showering but damn painful if you were taking a soad. Overall nice place in a great location.'
5,'The Affinia: a FANTASTIC place for a romantic getaway with the one you love.','This place is truly an amazing hotel; the staff was extremely courteous, friendly and very accommodating. My room was upgraded from a Deluxe to a One Bedroom Suite; although I had to wait a bit for the room to be ready, it was definitely worth it. With a very spacious livingroom and a cozy kitchenette, it was certainly a comfortable room to relax in after spending many busy days touring the city with my girlfriend.'
3,'need of an update, but clean','we have just got back from new york and we stayed in the pennsylvania. I was a bit worried after reading all the reviews , most of them not good. however we did enjoy our stay there,not because the hotel was luxurious but because of the great location .It was a few minutes from macys, the empire state building was just around the corner ,10 mins from times square and all the theatres,everything was within walking distance .The hotel is quite dated and shabby in places but although the room was a bit dark and old fashioned, the beds were clean and our bathroom had been updated with new toilet,basin and shower also newly tiled.It was not somewhere we had planned to spend alot of time in anyway so it served its purpose for us.The view from our window was a bit depressing though ,we were just facing other windows in the hotel and with the building being quite high (17 storeys ,I think.) we couldnt tell what sort of day it was outside as it always looked a bit dull and dark ( even though it was glorious sunshine) .I kept the curtains shut all the time ! The maids came in every day and changed the towels , which were lovely and white and made the beds , the check in was fast and efficient , overall our stay there was good but if you are looking for luxury this is not the place for you.'
4,'Good value if booked on Priceline','Yes, the room was small, but I was surprised by how nice it was. And, having paid only $100/night on Priceline, I felt it was a very good value. I would certainly stay there again.'
3,'OK But Not Spectacular','The Westin is a decent hotel, clean and well-situated. But it is not a dazzling hotel and for the price, I expected more. The color scheme and lighting result in a dark lobby -- it has the feel of the Loew\'s in Philly which is a renovated office building. The rooms are on the small side although the views are nice and the beds are comfy. There isn\'t a taxi stand so you need to get one on the street if the doorman is busy. The room service was good: very prompt service (35 minutes, as promised), reasonable prices ($20 entrees) and the food was hot and tasted good. When we return to NYC, though, we\'ll go back to the Hyatt at Grand Central -- it has more zip.'
5,'Great Ammenities, Location, And Rooms','This hotel is centrally located beside penn station, one of the largest subway stations in the city. They have big hotel rooms availible for families. One of my favourite things about this hotel is their pillow menu. It allows you to have the best sleep possible. You will never have to worry about a fire, because the fire station is beside the building. As long as you get a high floor, you will not need to worry about the noise. In the room we had, there was a living room, kitchen, 2 beds and 2 bathrooms. The room was a mix of old an new, because the building itself is new, but there were many contemporary items in the room. The hotel is very safe and they have security late at night. It is only a 5 minute walk to times square and you can get passes to go unlimited amount of times on the subway which is cheaper and more efficient than cabs.'
5,'Very small room','Rooms are extremely small and very pricy, but they are clean and the staff is amazingly courteous and helpful.'
4,'Hotel cómodo y céntrico','Hotel muy cómodo y céntrico para ver nueva york, con habitaciones amplias y limpias. \r\nHay varios recepcionistas que hablan en castellano, y son bastante amables lo que se agradece después de la paliza del viaje\r\nEl único pero es el aire acondicionado que ponen. Estuvimos en agosto y para entrar al vestíbulo tenías que ponerte una chaqueta porque lo tienen a 18 grados y en la calle estás a 33. En la habitación lo regulas tú mismo, aunque cuando entras la primera vez, está a esa temperatura, aunque eso pasa en todos los locales de NYC'
4,'Awesome views','I probably wouldn\'t have picked this hotel for my own personal vacation, since it is in the middle of the most crowded and touristy area. However, I do have to admit that it was fun to stay all the way up on the 44th floor overlooking the Hudson River. I did enjoy that view in the morning. \r\nThe room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was nice, but the lighting was very dim. I found it very hard to put makeup on. Also, bring your own hairdryer. The one there was awful. I did love the shower, though. It was a nice, big shower stall with lots of elbow room and a great shower-head. \r\nBeers at the downstairs bar were crazy expensive, but the bartenders were very nice. \r\nAlso, be warned- parking is about $40 a night!'
4,'Good location and rooms','Stayed for 4 nights. Got a nice newly renovated spacious room in upper floor. There are plenty of elevators, which is good. WiFi works well but is not included in the room price as it always should be. Lobby is nice and comfortable, although I find the paintings in the ceiling a bit funny. The bar has a good selection of refreshments and service is friendly, but there could be more seats. Location is great.'
1,'Roach Motel Manhattan','November 6, 2011 - The absolute worst stay of my life! Check-In was extreeeeeeemely slow, hotel renovations not as fabulous as seen on the website. We asked for accommodations for 2 with privacy and got a 1 bedroom suite with a pull out sofa. We did get 2 baths, although the second bath shower was extremely narrow. The next morning I walked into the bathroom and was greeted by the largest cockroach I had ever seen - literally, it was at least 2 inches in length. While my colleague and I (two women) stood in fright and disbelief, we managed to call housekeeping. A staff member arrived shortly - empty handed, and was suprised as we were to see such a huge bug. He proceeded to use a towel from the bathroom to swat it down and carry it away. The housekeeping mgr called to apologize for the inconvenience and offered a $50 deduction from our room charge. Really! After complaining about the bug and the manner in which it was removed, we were offered another $50 deduction by the hotel MOD. Really! We ended up being charged $200 more, and told that it would take another day to correct the problem. Long story short, we were comped for the room and I will never, ever stay at the Affinia hotels again! What an experience. Had I not been so petrified I would have taken a pic!'
4,'A friendly hotel with class','Being a hotel of historic value, you are sure to be impressed with its magnificent lobby. The lobby is not big but cozy and makes you want to just sit on the couches to relax after a tiring day of touring the sights. We even enjoyed sitting for a few moments by the spacious lobby (not the one where the reception is) while waiting for the elevators. The location is just perfect - located right in the loop. You could walk from the hotel to Millenium Park and Art Institute of Chicago. At the back is State Street which is the shopping district. There are lots of restos all around the hotel and a Starbucks right on the ground floor. This hotel\'s concierge is one of the most helpful we have ever encountered during our many travels abroad. Even the receptionists, doormen/bellboys are really courteous and helpful. I definitely recommend this hotel to any type of traveler!'
5,'Great Service','I am a Platinum member of SPG, and have stayed at the hotel roughly a dozen times. The front desk staff is very helpful and friendly. Luis at the Front Desk hadn\'t seen me since the summer, but recognized me and was very helpful.\r\nThe rooms are large for NY, and one of the few hotels I\'ve been in in NYC that is quiet. I\'m always upgraded (a junior suite or corner room in most cases). The staff of the Atrium Club is terrific. Hogue takes great care of me in the Atrium Club. \r\nThis is my preferred hotel for my frequent trips to NY.\r\nTodd S.'
5,'Excellent location, excellent service, excellent room, excellent value','Did the Macy\'s day package... had an amazing room w excellent views. We loved the newly remodeled look very clean, nice comfortable furniture, loved the bed,very nice kitchen. \r\n The staff was always very attentive.\r\nWhen my family of 5 arrived via minivan, we pulled right up and Anthony was waiting for us. He took all our bags and then valet parked the car. As it had taken 1.5 hours to go the last 6 miles from the Lincoln tunnel to the affinia I was very thankful... it was simply put very nice to receive the kindness and attention. Our room was always promptly cleaned every day and we all know that w a 6, 4, and 9 mos old that can be a pretty crazy hotel room for the staff... Van (Vandat) one of the other doorman was always courteous. And very helpful w baggage on the way out. I also want to give a great review to the employee originally from Ireland who gathered our bags and brought them down for us. Lastly Jenny and Margaret did A fantastic job w all of our front desk needs. This was our 3rd stay. Every time we stay the affinia exceeds our expectations. That has always been why we come back. Thank you to the staff of this wonderful hotel for making our Thanksgiving stay memorable. All in all my extended family had 13 people and 3 different rooms over a 3 day span. My parents have always had a great experience at the affinia(they have stayed there 6times now)\r\nRespectfully the Ternullo family'
5,'Super hotel-totally made my first stay in NYC!','When we arrived just before lunch time, one of our rooms was not quite ready (we were early for check in). They happily gave us the one room key so we could leave our bags. When we returned that night, we were given our second room key and shown to our room which was amazing! On the 30thfloor with a fantastic view of the empire state and chrystler building! It was thanksgiving while we were there and we were given loads of advice on where to go to watch the parade and the cheapest places to buy bus tickets etc. the tick tick diner was a great place to eat late at night and soak in the atmosphere, definitely the city that never sleeps! The hotel is in a great location, 5 mins walk from times square. I had such an amazing week, wouldn\'t hesitate to book here again! Holiday was booked with Thompson'
4,'Buen hotel','El hotel está viejo pero es céntrico, la atención es buena, la limpieza excelente y, lo mejor de todo, las camas, no he estado en otro hotel, ni de cinco estrellas, en que los colchones y las almohadas fueran tan cómodos, y es de agradecer con lo cansado que llegas a la habitación. Intentar que os den la habitación en uno de los últimos pisos, la vista es magnífica.'
1,'Grand Hyatt New York - schrecklich und nie mehr wieder!','Wer Grand Hyatt Hotels aus Asien oder Europa kennt, wird beim Grand Hyatt bitter enttäuscht. Der Standard des Hotels liegt auf dem Niveau eines schlechteren 3-Sterne-Hotels. Die Lage in Fußdistanz zu allen Sehenwürdigkeiten in Midtown ist klasse, das war\'s dann aber auch schon!\r\nIm Detail:\r\n1. Ankunft: Erst nach Aufforderung hilft uns der Page beim Aussteigen aus dem Taxi mit unserem Gepäck. Vorher bewusstes Wegschauen - Vorsicht, es kommt Arbeit...\r\n2. Zimmer: Dunkles Zimmer. Auf dem schwarzen Schreibtisch wurde seit Wochen kein Staub mehr gewischt. Die Ausstattung ist wohlwollend als minimalistisch zu bezeichnen. Keine Minibar, kein Duschgel, kein Kugelschreiber, geschweige denn ein Tea oder Coffee Maker. Wo ist hier die Grand Hyatt Qualität? Absoluter Hammer: Die Wände sind derart dünn, dass man jedes Wort im Nachbarzimmer hören konnte. Das nächtliche Schnarchen meines Nachbarn konnte nur durch Verwendung von Ohrstöpseln gedämpft werden.\r\n3. Abreise: Bei saftigen Preisen eines Grand Hyatt Hotels noch 2 USD pro Gepäckstück für die Gepäckaufbewahrung bezahlen zu müssen, ist schon ein starkes Stück. Eine entsprechende Beschwerde hierüber mündete in einen frechen Kommentar seitens des Hotelpagen. Und dass ein Grand Hyatt Hotel die aufzubewahrenden Gepäckstücke in der Hotellobby parkt, hebt die optische Qualität der 80er-Jahre-Lobby nicht gerade an.\r\nFAZIT: Für uns nie mehr wieder. EMPFEHLUNG: FINGER WEG VON DIESEM HOTEL. In Midtown gibt es bessere Hotels für weitaus weniger Geld.'
5,'en mi próxima visita...Volveré','He estado este verano en el hotel. Si vas a patearte Nueva York es lo mejor que puedes hacer. Está superbien situado, el trato que tuvimos excelente. Nosotros íbamos un poco asustados por las críticas que habíamos leído. En una de ellas decía que las habitaciones de no fumadores estaban bien, así lo hicimos y ...¡¡¡genial!!!.\r\nsi os lo estáis pensando no dudeis porque está en mitad de Manhattan, al lado de Broadway, a dos minutos del Empire .... yo estoy encantado.'
5,'Hotel perfetto in perfetta posizione','Assolutamente da provare se si trovano camere ad un buon prezzo come successo a noi...camera sulla 6th avenue,, 30esimo piano, pulizia impeccabile, camera grande e moderna, insomma tutto quello che si può volere da un hotel in centro città. migliorabili i servizi quali internet (a pagamento, caro) e piscina (assente), ma sono pecche veniali a confronto con i punti di forza di questo hotel!'
4,'ideal location','The Crowne Plaza is the ideal location if you are interested in being in Times Square. The rates were also very reasonable. The staff was friendly and the rooms were nice. One problem was a broken escalator three of the four days we were there. It was a problem because that escalator was the quickest way to get from the first floor to the second floor where the lobby was located. Due to this, the elevators also had longer-than-average waits. The other problem was the air conditioner in the room. It did work, but putting the dials at high and max-cool barely did the job. The highly-touted health club also charged for visiting depending on the time of day it was and what type of room the guest was staying in. I would stay at this hotel again for the location and the rates.'
5,'A great value for SPG Gold Member','We had excellent short stay at Westin. We were upgraded to a nice top floor corner room as Gold members. The room had nice water views, the service was impeccable. I liked it so much that I did not mind for once to pay $10 for bottle of water. Lovely place. I stayed in many hotels and I will be returning here. Thank you.'
4,caos,'Sono arrivata dall\'Italia sabato pomeriggio: il delirio!\r\nsarà xchè è proprio in Times Square ma c\'era il mondo.\r\ninnanzitutto la reception è all\'8 piano quindi coda per accedere agli ascensori, ovviamente con le valigie non era semplice prenderne uno xchè automaticamente tutti piu\' veloci di me passavano avanti, si xchè non sei tu che scegli l\'ascendore ma è lui che sceglie te!\r\nFila al check in.. \r\nSe vi piace l\'effetto vespaio allora fa x voi, immenso con tutti i corridoi per una trentina di piani che si affacciano sul vuoto dell\'interno, sugli ascensori resterni, forse potrebbe piacere xche\' ha quel non so che di futuristico.\r\nLe camere sono grandi e spaziose, ma è talmente impersonale e mi sono sentita veramente sola.'
4,'En el centro de Manhattan','Al llegar alucinas ya que el lobby es espectacular. La gente muy amable,exceptuando los botones que ni nos miraron a la hora de llevar las maletas.\r\n La habitación está muy bien,pero elbaño deja mucho que desear. No había bañera y era súper pequeño. Una cosa que me llamó la atención es que no había neverita en la habitación.\r\n La única queja que tengo del hotel es que en el check-in me retuvieron 320 dolares de la visa,los cuales se supone que te los devuelven 72 horas después de abandonar el hotel( hace más de 72 horas y no he recibido nada todavía). Por supuesto,ya íbamos con todo pagado. Lo hacen por si robas o rompes algo. He viajado mucho y no me lo han hecho en ningún hotel.\r\n Por lo demás,la situación es una pasada. Creo que lo bueno compensa lo malo. \r\n Os lo recomiendo,cuidado con la reteción del dinero.'
3,Average,'This hotel was not great and not up to Hilton standards at all! The rooms are atrocious the un renovated one\'s were crap! we booked 2 queen beds and were given 2 small double\'s, which were extremely small. The service during hurricane sandy was very good though and the staff are helpful and polite. This is also a great location so near to broadway, fashion district and central park and the empire state! overall apart from the room it was a pretty good place to stay.'
5,'All round excellent experience','I did a lot of research into which hotel to stay in for a two week work trip. Park Central kept popping up in my search and based on price, location etc I decided to book. I arrived late around 11pm (4am London time having not been to sleep!) and the check in was quick and really helpful. I asked for a room with a view but unfortunately none were available. I was advised that I could come back the next morning to see if a different room was available. The next morning I was directed to speak to the Manager at reception Ricky, who completely exceeded my expectations. He was polite and told me that he had a great room (with Times Square view) that I could check in later that day. It all worked out fantastically and I would stay here again without a doubt.\r\nPros - Location (2 min walk from the park), Service, Rooms, Price\r\nCons - Really tried hard to think of some, but i\'m struggling.\r\nWould recommend to anyone.'
5,gorgeous!!,'I liked it!! perfectly placed, luxe and great breakfast!'
1,'overpriced and dirty','Stayed here for 3 nights and was very unimpressed. Rooms were musty and had mildew on the ceiling above the window as well as the inside of my shower curtain. Could not get another room due to summer crowds. Requested a non smoking room but apparently my room was sandwiched between two smoking rooms and the stench of stale cigarette smoke was always in the air. Yuck.\r\nGreat location but this place should be put out of its misery and torn down to make room for a newer hotel. Stay here only as a last resort.'
3,'come volevasi dimostrare','Abbiamo soggiornato quattro giorni ad agosto all\'Hilton New York, purtroppo la sensazione non positiva che avevamo avuto al momento della prenotazione del viaggio é stata confermata.\r\nNotevole la posizione, é assolutamente centralissimo e vicinissimo a qualsiasi luogo da vedere in Manhattan, da Central Park a Times Square, al Rockfeller Centre, alla Fifth Avenue, ecc., per il resto si tratta di un hotel enorme, con una hall che sembra un porto di mare.\r\nLa camera che abbiamo avuto noi non era all\'altezza, l\'arredamento decisamente datato, dotazione molto scarsa nel bagno e, la prima sera, lenzuola nel letto non propriamente perfette; stiamo parlando di un 5 stelle lusso, di una catena internazionale famosa, il livello standard deve essere molto superiore a quanto abbiamo visto noi.\r\nPenso che l\'anno prossimo ritornerermo a New York, senz\'altro non in questo hotel.'
4,'Location is great for walking around all of NYC','I love this hotel for the location. You can walk everywhere or take the subway just across the street. The rooms are decent size for NYC and have been redone in an updated decor. The elevators are a little slow early in the a.m. when everyone is checking out. Great hotel!!'
4,'very good value and good location','i would recommend this hotel. we got upgraded to a room with a view of the river. The staff were very accommodating. The rooms were always clean. It\'s right beside penn subway station, we got the air train and the A straight there from the airport. It was also easily walkable to times square and we even walked to central park. Would stay here againz'

4,'Small rooms, great location, busy hotel','Well what can I say about this hotel it\'s a great location very busy hotel which also speaks volumes in its self all the staff were very helpful and polite my only issue was the room was quite small but it was spotless and all facilitates in working order a safe in the room would have been nice but I was able to use one in the reception, the general manager took the time to stop me and ask for some feedback on the hotel I did arrive just after hurricane sandy left NY and she explained they were having staffing issues because the staff couldn\'t get to work due to the effects of the hurricane but I must say my room didn\'t suffer because of it. The diner next to the hotel called tick tick diner was also a very busy diner with good food and super friendly staff anytime I passed my it was jam packed all in all I would most definitely return to this hotel if I ever return to New York.'
4,'Well positioned Hotel in Midtown NY','Stayed for 4 nights as part of a trip to NY and Florida. \r\nRoom was clean with new shower / toilet facilities. Good size for the 3 of us, with 2 double beds and a small kitchen area. \r\nExcellent location if flying into Newark airport - get the air train to Penn Station, the hotel is right across the street from the station.'
4,'great location','This hotel is at the corner of 8th Ave. and 43rd Street. Great location. 1 block away from Time Square. Hotel is clean and the service is good. We received a free upgrade to a higher floor(35th) which gave us a good view. Hotel bar is pricey. A drink will set you back $16.00. All the staff are friendly and helpful.'
4,'Esperienza da ripetere','Buon hotel, molto ben posizionato nel pieno cuore di New York.\r\nLe camere sono vecchie ma molto ben curate e pulite e il servizio alla reception e\' stato molto valido. A pochi minuti da Times Squire,di fronte al Madison Squire Garden,vicino all hotel c e\' anche la fermata della metro per poter girare comodamente per tutta la città !\r\nSemplicemente valido e comodo.!\r\nCi tornerò .!'
5,'Excellent Hotel....Loved It!','Having booked this hotel based on the comments on Trip Advisor, i thought it would only be fair, to give someone else the oppertunity of visiting such a fantastic hotel by giving my review.Even though this hotel has great reviews, i thought it was even better than what i read. The pictures certainly do not do it justice. The staff are extremely friendly, they can not do enough to help you,. The entrance of the hotel, gives you a lovely welcoming feel the minute you walk in the door. We had read that it was best to be higher up the hotel due to noise. I had room 2117on 21st floor,, and i have to be honest, the first night i did find it a bit noisey but this was only due to raindrops hitting the air con unit outside!, but after the first night, i slept like a baby for the other 5 nights...the other members of my family were on floors 9 and 12, and they said they didnt hear anything at all. the rooms were exceptionally clean, they have thought of everything, to help you feel comfortable. The beds are huge and very comfortable, and the room size was very large, although we didnt make use of the kitchen. the location is fantastic, for the shoaholics, you are 10 steps away from Maceys, and you are opposite Madison sq gardens. My Parents room overlooked the big screen, which they loved...My room loooked over the Empire State, which i thought was amazing.I could not fault this hotel, everything about it was fantastic, i would definitly go back.....If i had to pick a bad point about the trip, it would not be with the hotel, i would just advise not to use the blue shuttle bus to and from the airport, its overpriced, and the staff are very rude.\r\nTo everyone going to New York, this hotel is a must.'
2,'Not worth the money','So you pay an average of $200 per night for an art deco hotel which is nice to look at but certainly not worth the money. Yes alot of NY hotel rooms are small, but my god this was a closet with cheap furniture. Not recommended for anyone coming for outside of NY, you can certainly find better hotels for your money with bigger rooms and friendlier service'
3,'Nice location, unassuming hotel, small rooms...','My title really says it all. I liked this hotel, I didnt love it. The location was convenient to where we needed to be. We drove by it a few times before we realized that this was the hotel! The rooms were very clean and extremely small. Our particular room was no larger than a college dorm room. The bed literally took up the whole room. There was an equally small bathroom. Not what I like when I am staying in a hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the only reason I didn\'t give this Hotel less stars. \r\nThere is no room service and in fact, the only restaurant on property was closed for renovations. NOt at all convenient when you would like a cup of coffee etc. Parking is $55.00 overnight -which is about the going rate in the city to park overnight when staying at hotels. We parked and took cabs everywhere because if you take your car out of valet, your charged every time. \r\nOur room was on the 5th floor facing the front of the building. Not a great idea! We were awoken all night from the sounds of car horns, sirens, people yelling(yes people yelling) and the hooves of the horses of the Hansom cabs! When we were able to fall back to sleep we were then again awoken by the voices coming from the rooms next door through the the paper thin walls! You can hear everything people in the next rooms were saying as well as people walking in the halls! I am from New York, so noise isn\'t usually an issue for me....it was here!\r\nOverall our stay was nice. The hotel it self is fine. It was just nice, nothing special. I know you can find other hotels, with more enmities at the same price. For me I rather pay more and get the luxuries I have come to expect at hotels.'
1,'Never again','The hotel has a beautiful lobby. Very large. I think the ceilings in the lobby were at least 3 stories tall. Wonderful architecture. Very classy. Now to the rooms. I had a King room that I booked on Priceline. You don\'t get to select the type of room on priceline like you do on expedia, orbiz, or any other travel site, so I had to call to make sure I had a King room. I was also told by a friend to ask for the more renevated room, which I was able to get, (I guess). The room was very very small. the bed was about 6 or 7 feet from the door. The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall (tacky) including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv. (tacky again). The bathroom was ok, small but ok. \r\n I order room service, a $12 cheeseburger and soda turned out to be $32 after state tax, city tax, room service fee, 18\% gratuity for room service orders. And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray. Seriously?? A soda in the vending machine was $2.50 and so was bottled water. Luckily there was a 7-elevan down the street for my late night cravings. \r\n I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning. At 8am I am waken up by vacuuming by my door. Mind you the bed is close to the door. I felt like I was being punked. I guess do not disturb in only to keep the maids from knocking on your door. They didnt finish vacuuming the long azz hallway til and hour and a half later. \r\n There was no view from my window, only the back fire escape and the building next to me. \r\n I would never stay at this hotel or suggest anyone stay here.'
3,'Lo necesario, sin desayuno.','Hotel con gran dimensión. Muy céntrico. Bien comunicado con Guagua y Metro. Se puede ir caminando a TimeSquare y a Central Park... Las habitaciones son muy amplias. Personal muy profesional.'
5,'Well Run','Although this hotel is immense, it is beautifully run. The staff is well trained and friendly. The elevator system is very intresting---you punch in the floor you want and are assigned an elevator. This is almost always very quick and not too crowded. I thought our room was well-planned, clean, and decorated in a fun geometric sytle. My only possible complaint about this hotel is also one of its big selling points, I\'m sure...the location right on Times Square. It is just a matter of personal preference, but I could do without the crowds, lights, etc., on a full-time basis. The draperies and insulation make this a very quiet hotel despite the hub-bub outside.'
3,'A bit banged up, but great location and price','I was heading to NYC on short notice, and found that this place had rooms available at a reasonable price (averaging at about $100/night). I planned to take the subway from JFK, so I knew it would be easy to find as its across the street from Penn. Station. It has 1,700 rooms and is filled with tourists (lots of tired looking people in the lobby). It has a neglected feel - nicks and dents in the walls, paint peeling in the bathroom, and a dripping shower (ok when I closed the door). Noisy young people down the hall. No view, but the bed was really comfortable and good quality sheets. It is conveniently located an easy walk from Times Square, Macy\'s and with good bus and subway connections to the rest of Manhattan.'
2,'Dark, dirty, overpriced','I booked my room at this hotel based on the pictures on their website and the price. I was in town for a conference nearby. I was very disappointed. The pictures didn\'t match the actual rooms at all. \r\nThe lobby looks immaculate and the location is convenient but that\'s about it. Check-in on a Thursday night at 10 pm took 20 minutes. There were 3 attendants checking in a long line of people. The attendants were not friendly. They were argumentative with guests who were obviously disappointed with what they got. \r\nWhen I went to the 7th floor and found my room the door was open. When I opened the door I was slightly worried that someone was going to jump out of the shower with a butcher knife. Once I turned on the light I noticed the threadbare, dirty carpet. The room itself was depressing. The bathroom dirty. No hair dryer (as promised on website). I stayed in a room with two queen beds. Both beds were rock hard and uncomfortable. The pillows flat and stiff. I stayed in a corner room and every night (I stayed 4 nights) there was a banging sound. I couldn\'t figure out what it was - luckily I had a white noise app on my iPhone to drown out the horrible sound. I wouldn\'t stay here again or recommend it to anyone.'
4,'right in the middle of much excitement','can\'t beat the location. the room was nice with a great view to hell\'s kitchen and the river. lobby currently being re-modeled. bummer. staff friendly... great elevator system. generally very clean. NYC is such a great city... loved being back.'
4,'Great location, all-in-all a nice hotel','The location is fantastic, and we were upgraded to a corner room - which had decent views including the Hudson river on one side, and a glimpse into Times Square on the other (as good as you could reasonably expect in midtown NYC). The room was good. Bathroom very dated with aluminium finishings and a sliding door for entrance. As there was so much choice outside the hotel, only had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar. Would be 3/5 stars, but am giving it 4/5 for the fab location.'
3,'Not the best choice for the money','This hotel has a beautiful exterior, but it is disappointing from there. They claim to be four star, but it is really three star. The hotel is older and shows wear. Service is poor...after three requests for a toothbrush from three different people I was finally brought a razor! Front desk was only mildly helpful or friendly. Our room was okay, but drinking glasses were very dirty, no conditioner in room and no wash cloths! I would not stay here again.'
5,'Convenient, clean, comfortable hotel','The Hilton New York is clean, comfortable, well-located and offers excellent service and amenties. Although it seems a bit old, the lobby and certain floors have been recently renovated. Our 30th floor room came complete with mini-bar and large flat-screen TV. Although we didn\'t have much time, we were able to use the check-in kiosk, the taxi service, baggage hold service, and visited the hotel bar. I\'d highly recommend this hotel for tourists and business travelers alike.'
5,Amazing!!,'Best hotel in Chicago!! I\'ve stayed in many modern hotels before, all luxury, but I can\'t help but love the Palmer House the most. The Hilton Chicago is great as well but so far removed from Everything else. Honestly my best memory from this trip is getting back from a long day of walking and sitting in the lobby with a box of Frango bought from Marshall Fields with my family. With the calming Christmas music and amazing ceiling it makes the perfect atmosphere. \r\nThey don\'t make hotels like this anymore. I tried exploring the whole thing but its just to huge! There are hallways and ballrooms, spiral staircases and old creepy ones. One time I entered a stairway that was absolutely terrifying but exciting at the same time, and when reaching the top I came out on the balcony overlooking the grand ballroom. The staff is great and gave us no attitude for searching the place from head to toe. There were others looking around its many ballrooms as well and is an Amazing building with so much history. \r\nThe rooms were very nice but obviously old. I didn\'t mind at all but I will warn you. The pool was old as well and not as good as some of the others I\'ve seen in Chicago ie Marriott residence inn where the pools on the roof and has panoramic views of he city lights at night with glass windows all around you and you can go on the corner and it feels like your standing on the edge of a building. The palmer house pool has a glass roof and is in a courtyard. It does have a hot tub too which is nice. I honestly can say that whenever I go to Chicago and stay somewhere else It will not be the same.\r\nWish I was there right now. Stay at the Palmer house and you won\'t regret it.'
5,'Truly a grand hotel, worth every penny.','I have stayed in some beautiful old hotels, but the lobby of the Palmer House puts all other grand hotels to shame. Spectacular ceiling mural, huge, original Tiffany lighting sculptures, a red lacquer ballroom that is amazing, and a grand ballroom that is stunning. All public areas are amazing. My room had two double beds and two bathrooms. My guess is that in the recent renovations, they took two small rooms and combined into one. Beautiful furnishings. Bathrooms were small but nice. Room was very quiet. My Hilton Honors membership gave me quick check in. No free wi-fi, but I did get free high-speed internet. I always carry my iPad, so good thing I brought my laptop along with me, too.\r\nGood location, close to art museum, lakefront, Macy\'s (former Marshall Fields flaship store), and only a reasonably short walk to Michigan avenue\'s Mag Mile.\r\nThis was a very nice stay for a business trip.'
4,'Hotel em Nova York','Em plena Times Square , excelente localização, muito fácil para se deslocar para qualquer canto . Hotel excelente, apartamento excelente, servicos bons. Tomar cuidado com uso do telefone e internet , os preços são abusivos.'
3,'Nice location.','Very nice location, with restaurants and fast foods next to the hotel.\r\nThe furniture and accomodantions could be more modern. Nice price and good staff.'
5,'J.P. Garcia\'s Park Central NY review from Feb 10th to Feb 16th 2012','I have been staying at the Park Central for almost 15 years, it\'s location is superb. I was treated great at the front desk by Fady and Ellen, whom after checking my record gave a fantastic upgrade to a suite due to my Loyalty without saying a word. The service is phenomenal specially Irma my cleaning lady on floor 22nd. I highly reccomend Park Central in all aspect, a wonderfull hotel at a great price and value.'
4,'A good Time\'s Square hotel','We stayed here for four nights during \r\nEaster weekend. We are very satisfied with the hotel. The location was excellent. within walking distance to the theaters and a lot of restaurants. We had a great room on the 44th floor. Great view and no bed bugs!!!!! The concierge was very helpful and friendly. The only complain is the wifi is not free. It should be free at the lobby. We got free wifi at Starbucks across the street. I would stay here again.'
3,'Muy justito','Está magnificamente situado, céntrico y no hace falta salir del hotel para acceder a la gran estación central. Por lo demás la habitación es pequeña, ruidosa, sin ninguna vista ( nos la dieron orientada a la parte trasera) y la limpieza deja mucho que desear, retiré las mesitas porque perdí las llaves de las maletas y creí ver un hamster de la borra que había. No hay minibar, y se encuentra mucho a faltar, ya que si compras bebida, fruta o yogurts no tienes donde guardarlos. También está muy bien adaptado para discapacitados, eso sí si viajan sin familia, en nuestro caso viajamos con nuestras dos hijas y al poner la cama supletoría para ellas la habitación que ya de por si no es de grandes dimensiones quedo en poco más que un pasillo en forma de L mas el acceso al lavabo, con lo que con la silla de ruedas a duras penas se podía dar la vuelta, aunque la ducha era accesible el lavabo estaba pesimamente diseñado, era sumamente bajito y de dimensiones ridículas, por lo demás todos los accesos estaban bien para la silla de ruedas. De todas formas, quizás si volviera a New York, que volveremos porque nos ha encantado, igual nos alojariamos en el mismo hotel, simplemente por la excelente ubicación..'
1,'vecchio, sporco e maleodorante','Se avessimo dovuto passare più di una notte in un hotel come l\'edison, che più che ad un albergo assomiglia ad un ostello, avremmo certamente contratto qualche malattia!!!! Vi sconsiglio di andarci perchè è sporco, odora di muffa, materasso e cuscini scomodi, bagno piccolo, sporco, doccia non funzionante e acqua freddissima o caldissima!!!!!\r\nPraticamente un posto da chiudere!!!!'
4,'Comfort and convenience','First trip to NY and beware the sirens! One side of the hotel is above a FIre Station and the fire tenders do go out a lot!!\r\nWe loved our studio and balcony. We were at the front of the hotel and found this quieter than the side suite we had the first night. The balcony seemed to block some of the traffic sounds from below. \r\nHotel is being updated and we heard the workmen in the morning above our room. Didn\'t bother us but may others. \r\nYes air conditioning units taped in window to reduce draughts were a \'feature\' but we loved the hotel and friendly staff. The bed was really comfy and we appreciated the kitchenette and found a way round no kettle was to just put water in coffee filter to make tea in the morning!! It was all part of the NY experience.\r\nAlso a plus was the easy route in from JFK airport.via rail link. Then only a short walk to Affinia from station.\r\nWe walked everywhere and the Affinia always welcomed us \'home\'. It may be a bit \'tired\' in parts but we don\'t like perfection..we\'d rather have frriendliness and quirky!!!'
3,'Hotel punktet durch Lage','Diese Hotel liegt sehr nahe am Times Square. Dieses Hotel ist auch bestens geeignet um Roundtrips zu machen und sich die Sehenswürdigkeiten anzusehen. Der Check in nervt. Dauert immer sehr lange. Es ist einfach ein sehr grosses Hotel in der city. Die Zimmer sind sehr alt und besonders die Bäder müssen erneuert werden. Hier gibts die grössten - Punkte! Trotzdem ist das Hotel wg. seiner guten Lage und des Preises empfehlenswert. Zum Übernachten OK.'
5,'Great Hotel','Great hotel, looked after us very well. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Bath\'s were a little small. Hotel Lobby very impressive. Slight confusion with getting our two rooms next to each other but quickly sorted.\r\nGreat location on 42nd Street. 15 minute walk to Times Square and 5 minutes to 5th Ave and right next door to Grand Central Station'
5,Excellent,'This is really good hotel, excellent location for all that is going on in New York. The view of Times Square is amazing without the noise.\r\nThe hotel has a 4 star feel without the price. The food in the restaurant was very very good. \r\nEveryone working there was attentive and friendly. The concierge was excellent in getting us broad way tickets.'
3,'Just ok','This hotel is in a nice place, almost front of MSG. Just this.\r\nRoom was so small and bath should be refurbishe.\r\nI\'m sure its possible to find another hotel, cheaper e better.'
1,'Warning: The Edison Hotel is Truly an Awful Hotel','After reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor I can only conclude that there must be two Edison Hotels in Manhattan because the one I stayed at was truly awful.\r\nThe one and only positive comment I can make is that the hotel is in a good location and only steps to Times Square.\r\nOn the other down side: The hotel is very dated, the rooms are very dirty, the beds are old and uncomfortable, the rooms are very dirty, the hotel is pretty noisy, the rooms are very dirty, the carpets are older then I am, ripped wallpaper, rust stained bathroom fixtures, did I mention the hotel is very dirty?\r\nUnless your idea of a fun is staying in a crackhouse I would highly recommend staying anywhere else.'
2,'Non un 4 stelle','Abbiamo fatto questa scelta poiche\' abbiamo scelto una vacanza piuttosto lunga con tappa a ny di 6 giorni. Stanze non troppo belle, piuttosto vecchie e anguste. Bagni molto vecchi, seppur abbastanza puliti. No frigo bar, no wireless free. 14 dollari al giorno per navigare. Le porte delle stanze sono molto vecchie e sottili, si sente addirittura l\'acqua scorrere delle camere adiacenti. Seppur centralissimo, non mi sento di consigliarlo per chi, come me, considera l\'hotel parte integrante della vacanza. Diciamo che, considerando i prezzi della citta\', può\' essere una soluzione accettabile... Ma assolutamente non e\' un albergo di buon livello. Hall e ambienti comuni molto scuri e poco luminosi. Moquette pressoche\' ovunque. Le lenzuola erano comunque pulite, ma mi ha ricordato un po\' l\'ambiente di un motel piuttosto che quella di un albergo. Per le bevande trovate macchinette automatiche suo corridoi.'
3,'The worst room in NYC','Came to New York this past weekend with my daughter for conference, as well as some shopping in the mix.\r\nTHE BAD: \r\nOk, so here\'s the story. We got there early in the morning and no rooms were available. We were allowed to check our bags, and see the city before checking in later that afternoon. Upon check-in, the guy at the front desk told us that he had given us a great room. What a complete lie! First off, the room was incredibly small (#2341). Not a big deal as it is expected in New York City. However, there was no shower head on the shower, and water sprayed everywhere all over the bathroom. When one tried to shut off the water it would continue to drip. Our room was located right beside the electrical room and across from one of the housekeeping storage areas. Therefore sleeping, was not a feasible possibility. We called down to the front to ask for a room change but they assured us that the noise would quiet down and there would be no problem. ANOTHER LIE! Not only were doors slamming all evening long but the noise from the staff yelling and talking to each other was also loud and annoying. Our room was also apparently right beside the external piping of the building as every 15-20min we would hear water rushing through the pipes (right by our heads). Both my daughter and I could not sleep the entire night. Having to be at a conference early the next morning we were exhausted and frustrated, which ruined a good portion of our day that day. I have absolutely no idea how anyone could sleep in that room, or how the hotel staff could even consider placing paying guests there. (Also forgot to mention the periodic scratching noises we heard throughout the night...mice anyone?)\r\nTHE GOOD: So after enduring our night from hell, we finally called the front desk again and asked to speak to the manager. The woman we spoke to (Erica) was great. After listening to all our complaints she set us up with a Deluxe room (apparently only 2 of these on a floor) that was NO COMPARISON to our first. This one was located in a corner on the floor. Lots of space, large windows, and quiet with a great view of the Empire State Building as well. Just wish we didn\'t have to go through hell to get it. \r\nOther good points: staff were great, and the location is very good being right across from Penn Station and walking distance to lots of great shopping and sights. \r\nThere are too many other great hotels in the city that I can\'t say I\'d ever come back here, even though they made up for the horrible first night we had. Either make sure you book a deluxe room, or save yourself the worry and book elsewhere.'
5,'Una muy buena opción en la Gran Manzana','Lo principal para destacar es la ubicación, frente al Madison Square Garden, algunas líneas de subte en la esquina y otras a un par de cuadras. La atención de todo el personal es muy buena, muy dispuestos para colaborar en lo que sea necesario. Algunas habitaciones tienen una vista bellisima del Empire State. El hall es amplio y agradable. Las habitaciones son pequeñas (pero como en la mayoría de los hoteles de la ciudad). El baño limpio, la ducha salía a muy buena temperatura y con buena presión.'
5,'They listen to the customer!!!!','We were at the Palmer House Hilton on a business trip for 6 nights. We were assigned a lovely room, however it was very small. My wife went to ask was that normal size of the Hilton Honors room and with no hesitation; I had Armonde\'s complete attention. He understood the problem, and then proceeds to fix it by placing us in a much larger room. I felt like he knew we were going to be there for 6 nights and it could become very uncomfortable for us. He further indicated that if we were not happy with the new room to let him know. Then he took the time to write a personal note to us offering further assistance if needed. We needed no further assistance. Wonderful location and close to lots of shopping and restaurants. We could hear the train outside, but there was no stop there, so it became white noise. Great housekeeping service also.'
4,'Awesome stay','Location was perfect. 5 minute walk to Radio City / Rockefeller Center. Times Square right there. 10 minutes to St Patricks Cathederal and Central park. 20 minutes to Empire State building. We walked from Battery Park through Wall street, Chinatown, Little Italy, Washington Square and back to Times Square in about 2 hours. $250/night. Room was average size of a normal hotel room and very nice. The only complaint I have is the room was a little warm even with a window propped open. For a guy that is The cheapest man alive I would definitely recommend this hotel. Location is everything! Subway lines are right there too.'
5,'The Perfect Valentine Getaway','My boyfriend and I were looking to do something very romantic in Manhattan. We are residents of New York City and thought it would be fun to get away at a nice hotel in the city. We chose the Hudson hotel near the Columbus Circle area. Everything about our stay was perfect, it made our first Valentine\'s together that more memorable. We checked in on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm. We were helped by Hudson Regional Guest Experience Manager, Ms. Shacazia Brown. She was very pleasant, knowledgeable and all smiles upon our arrival. She made us feel very welcomed and seemed thankful about having our business. We were checked into our room within 5 minutes. She gave us a brief tour of the hotel\'s Library Bar, Hudson Bar and Restaurant area. She knew in advance that is was a special romantic weekend and presented us with chocolates and a bottle of champagne in our deluxe studio room. The decor was amazing- dark, hardwood floors with white and silver steel furniture. I must have said at least three times during our stay, I want to LIVE here. Instead of visiting the MOMA, we ended up taking a nap for two hours after feeling how comfortable our queen size bed felt. After we returned from dinner, we had reservations at the Library Bar near a fireplace. It was such a romantic setting for celebrating our love. We relaxed for an hour and went back to our room to freshen up. We had 11pm reservations at the Hudson bar and were seated immediately. The DJ played great tunes all night as we sipped champagne, ate strawberries and danced. The party was filled with people of all different ages and cultures. It was nice to be in a different atmosphere for a change. We ended the night sleeping like babies in our comfortable bed. The next morning we had breakfast at Hudson\'s beautiful rustic style restaurant. The breakfast selection was divine and my palate was extremely satisfied. Upon check out the next morning, we were greeted and checked out in 60 seconds. As we left the hotel, my boyfriend and I smiled at one another and agreed we must come back for another visit very soon! The Hudson hotel is definitely a wonderful choice no matter what the occasion.'
3,'Average hotel at a great location','We stayed at the Penn for four five nights. Check in took quiet a while as there are only 3 counters open but staff was friendly. \r\nThe room was small, clean but gloomy due to the lights. The bathroom needs an upgrade as water keeps dripping all the time and towel hangers are only for decoration.\r\nThe cleaning staff can be very noisy in the early mornings but rooms very always cleaned very good.'
5,'What a surprise!','For some reason the New Yorker Hotel always said to me...I\'m on a bus trip and don\'t know where else to stay. What it should have said was...hey, I\'m the perfect location, a fair price (by NY standards) and nicely appointed rooms. We were a party of 5 and stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. It met our needs with flying colors. You could not ask for a better location! Macy\'s was 1 block away, the Times Square area was viewable out the front door, Penn Station basically across the street and we had a view of the Empire State Building!! It was great. The Tick Tock Diner had a great breakfast and I can only assume dinner would be good as well. The diner also had good prices. I will absolutely stay here again!'
4,'Corner rooms for a sweeping NYC View!','Iv stayed at this hotel thrice, and for the following reasons:\r\n- It has the best most central location for those who love to be in the hustle and bustle of Times Square. the port authority bus terminal and Subway are literally two steps away.\r\n- 5th avenue is a short walk away for shopaholics like myself.\r\n- countless dining options in the theatre district are also minutes away.\r\n- the rooms are generous in size, well appointed and varied. Three stays and i tried 3 different type of rooms, corner rooms on the higher floors being my favorite for a spectacular view of the West. The heavenly beds really are heavenly! \r\nService is always efficient. Nothing out of the ordinary to mention in that department, but nothing disappointing either.\r\nFirst timers in New York would love this hotel, its in the middle of all the buzz.'
4,'Old, but in a gorgeous location','Small rooms, the heater took too long to start working and walls looking old and musty. Problems of a giant hotel that is not streamlined, but I do not regret staying here: In front of the Madison Square Garden, with subway stations and train literally at the door, bustling nightlife that allowed me to come back late at night to the hotel without worry about security, incredible diversity of restaurants and pubs nearby and only a 5 minute walk to Times Square. For the price I paid, sure to get it back on the next visit to NY.'
2,'Good location but a tight fit','The Hotel porters who sussed from our luggage tags that we had arrived in NY on the Queen Mary 2 bet us before we saw our room that it would be smaller than our cabin on the ship. Too true. The management might describe the accommodation as being bijoux, trendy or arty but does this apply to having only 8 inches of clearance between the front edge of the en-suite wc and the blank dividing wall? \r\nThe Hudson was constructed in 1928 by the daughter of J.P Morgan as a clubhouse for the American Women’s Association and a residence for young women. Consequently the rooms are small and not designed for multiple occupancy. One assumes the ladies had single beds, better suited to the room dimensions.\r\nWe only got $1.43 to the pound so the cost of Hudson Hotel food, drink and particularly room-service was prohibitive. We dined out and breakfasted at a local coffee house.\r\nThe Hotel atrium is attractive and the roof terrace [ when open ] is an asset. But the main attraction of the Hotel is its location. It is close to the Subway at the SW corner of Central Park and there are several ethnic restaurants in the vicinity. Times Sq area is within walking distance [just]\r\nWhen checking out of the Hudson please avoid the large queues at the desk that can form at peak period when numerous guests are arriving and departing. Pre-arrange your checkout or you may miss your transfers to the Airport.'
3,'Too much dough for a cheap room','This was our first time in Chicago. We decided to stay at the Palmer Hilton because it was downtown, had a pool, was a Hilton hotel and had cheaper (still expensive) parking than other hotels. Originally, we booked through Marlin Travel for 179.99/night. We requested a king size bed but when we got there, we were arranged 2 doubles. They offered to upgrade to a king with premium services; orderves from 5-9pm, unlimited non-alcoholic drinks and snacks all day and a contiential breakfast for 39.99/night for the upgrade. We decided to upgrade. So the room was 179.99 + 39.99 for the upgrade + 37 dollars for self parking (they wanted 61 for valet). The building was beautiful in the lobby. The staff were so nice and courteous.Plenty of weddings and events were going on and I can see why. It looked as though you were in the middle of Italy with a painted ceiling and columns around. However. The room was small. Very small. There was no couch, just a basic bed, basic desk and a TUBE tv. The remote hardly worked. The bathroom was most disappointing. You could not sit on the toilet with the door open as it would hit your knees. The door also hit the bathrub when opened. You couldn\'t get ready in the morning without closing the door. The shower head was a duel-like shower which was the only benefit. There was no seperate shower. The room also did not have a mini fridge, it did have a safe though. The pool was nice- it had a nice skylight. It was also nice that the hottub was seperate from the pool. The towels in the pool area were very nice.\r\nOverall, due to the cost, I would not stay at this hotel again. You do not get enough for what you are paying.'
4,'Nice midtown hotel','We have a rate here and I paid about $218 which is good value for this part of midtown. Room very well appointed and recently refurbished by the looks of it. Slept very well. The corridors and rest of the hotel could do with a bit of modernization, but on the whole no complaints.'
3,'Très bien situé mais déçus.','L\'hôtel est très bien situé entre la gare Grand Central Terminal à visiter (nouvelle boutique Apple pour ceux que cela intéresse) et le Chrysler Building. Proche de Times Square, Rockefeller Building, Madison Ave. 5th Ave. etc. Personnel aimable à la réception et conciergerie. Pourquoi déçue : hall d\'entrée moderne mais froid - au sens propre et figuré - airco fonctionnant très fort. Le lobby est immense, encombré tous les matins par de nombreux groupes principalement de jeunes d\'où cette impression de hall de gare. Avant notre arrivée, nous avions téléphoné à plusieurs reprises pour être certains d\'avoir une chambre avec frigo (primordial pour y conserver des médicaments). La chambre attribuée (2345) donnait sur l\'arrière, était sombre et... surprise, lors de l\'ouverture du meuble, emplacement frigo..vide ! Après réclamation auprès de la réception, un ouvrier s\'est amené avec un appareil. Impossible de le placer à l\'emplacement prévu, cette personne l\'a donc posé à côté d\'un fauteuil et l\'a branché à une prise murale. Après son départ, nous nous sommes aperçus que pour que le frigo fonctionne, il fallait laisser toutes les lumières allumées. D\'un pratique pour dormir ! Nous avons donc dû demander à un couple d\'amis qui nous accompagnait d\'héberger les médicaments pour une nuit. Comme à notre arrivée nous avions émis le souhait de nous trouver une chambre sur le devant du building et si possible près de celle de nos amis, nous avons pu occuper le lendemain une chambre en surclassement et AVEC un frigo convenable. Salle de bain petite avec wc calé entre lavabo et douche. Pas de produit de douche uniquement pain de savon. Lit king size très confortable. Internet très cher 12 $ par jour.Restaurant de l\'hôtel : dîner du soir, viande très bonne, mais tout comme les frites et légumes, très épicée. Coût pour 2 personnes 110 $ (y compris vin et eau). Au début, avons pris le petit déjeuner à l\'hôtel Roosevelt 70 $ pour 2. Finalement, sommes allés au snack Prêt à manger 5 couques + 1 petite bouteille de jus orange + 2 cafés +/- 20 $ pour 2. Conseillons prendre un ticket 48h sur un bus rouge Hop on/hop off. 89 $ p/p moins fatiguant. Pour ce prix aussi, entrées à l\'Empire State Building, Ground Zero, bateau vers la statue de la Liberté, Ellis island et retour.\r\nConclusion : un séjour qui nous a enchanté mais un hôtel où ne retournerons pas.\r\nPour info : climat chaud et humide.'
5,'Loved the Marquis','My husband & I (ear;y 60\'s) stayed five nights at The Marquis in September, third visit to NY first time staying in Times Square. Had a standard room which was larger than I expected with a king size bed,sofa, extra chair, large closet and plenty of drawers. Big bathroom, plenty of towels etc. Location was great, close to everything. Was concerned it would be noisy but heard no street noise at all from the room. Room was spotless. Gym was very well equiped, used it a few time. Check in/out was quick and efficient. Staff courteous and helpful. I requested three things when I booked, early check in after an overnight flight, high floor and a refrigerator in the room. We arrived at the hotel around 10,30am and were able to go to our room immediately. Located on 27th floor. A man delivered the mini fridge to our room within five minutes of our arrival, no extra charge. We could not find any fault in this hotel and would definately stay there again on future trips and would recommend to anyone visiting NYC.'
4,'Good Choice in spite of.....','Hotel is in a great location and staff is very helpful. When I asked for a recommendation for dinner in the area, one of the staff recommended a nice Italian restaurant down the street and actually walked us there. Room size was bigger than I expected for New York city. Hotel even has a car sercvice available. Down side - shower drain clogged after a shower and standing water stayed in tub all night. Toilet required two to three flushes to empty. Hotel did not offer a discount or anything to compensate when I reported it at checkout. Hopefully, this was an isolated incident. I would definitely give this hotel another chance if working in NYC again.'
4,'Decent hotel for business trips','To be honest expected a bit more for such a price ( 260$ per night). Minimum of toiletries.\r\nRegular rooms are quite small. Location is great. Lobby always feel a bit overcrowded. No buffet breakfast only a la carte. bar is a bit pricey ( 18$ for a glass of wine). Be aware that there are two entrances . That is important to know in case you you are having some transfers'
5,'Toplage des Hotels an Central Station','Tophotel in Superlage direkt an/über centralstation. Das Zimmer war nicht riesig aber topp in ordnung, service sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Restaurant nicht getestet, bin lieber unten in den Essbereich in Central Staition gegangen. Jeder ander service aber perfekt und ohne tadel. Zimmer immer super gereinigt und bad war sehr gepflegt. Aussicht aus meinem zimmer seitlich. Wege vom Hotel zum Brodway und Fifth Avenue sehr kurz. Auch zum UNO Gebäude oder zum centralpark kann man durchaus laufen. Jederzeit zu empfehlen für einen entspannten aufenthalt in NEW YORK.'
3,'Shabby, but quieter than expected','Other reviewers are correct when they say that the lobby is far nicer than the actual rooms. I\'ve really never seen such a contrast; it\'s almost like they\'re implicitly saying that they only need your business once.\r\nI don\'t get too hung up on perfection in a room, so the shabby floor was fine by me - it was clean, as was the rest of the room. The air conditioner was a piece of garbage; it\'s hard to imagine it working well in the summer. It was basically a vent to the outside world, so I felt fortunate to be in this room on a nice spring evening - not too hot, not too cold.\r\nFor some reason, I was put in a room directly across from the elevators - this was clearly a handicapped-accessible room. I wasn\'t too happy with this - the hotel didn\'t appear to be anywhere near full, so I\'d think a room by the elevators would be a last resort. I was worried about foot traffic keeping me awake, but it ended up not being an issue at all.\r\nOn the 16th floor, I could still hear the street noise as if I was on the 1st (again - the AC unit was basically a hole in the window). Being across from Madison Square Garden on the night of a Ranger\'s playoff game made me nervous about getting a good night\'s sleep (as did the incessant cab honking). But around 10:30 it all died down, and I was able to sleep just fine.\r\nAll in all, I expected to have a lot of trouble sleeping, but ended up getting plenty of rest without a problem. The hotel is not sparkling new, but it is clean. Still, I think for the money, one could do better nearby - either with a nicer room for the same price, or a cheaper room that\'s equally as nice (or not) as one in the Affinia.'
3,'Great Room, Terrible Executive Loungs','I\'m a Marriott Platinum member and got a gorgeous room with a fabulous view using points. Because of my status, I had priority checkin, thank goodness. Checkin lines were long and chaotic. Of course I was there at the end of July, the height of the tourist season (not recommended). The location is fabulous on Times Square. The revolving restaurant is awesome but very expensive, so usually we just had drinks at the revolving lounge and went elsewhere for dinner. I was entertaining friends from overseas and they just adored their first trip to NYC. A huge disappointment was the concierge lounge--very crowded, lines, noisy, could barely find a place to sit. Had to pay for coctails, including beer and wine. The housekeeper that took care of my room was so nice! We chatted several times. I found all the staff to be helpful, except in the conciege lounge, where they seemed overwhelmed.'
5,'Best Times Square Hotel','I\'ve stayed in at least ten different hotels in the Times Square area, and the Westin clearly sets the gold standard. Since my wife was traveling with me for a 3 day weekender in the city, I wanted to stay at a nice property and the Westin didn\'t disappoint. We reserved a non-smoking king with a request for a view room. When we opened the door we experienced a panoramic view of the Hell\'s Kitchen neighborhood and the Hudson River extending from the George Washington Bridge to Madison Square Garden. The location is excellent, a block away from Times Square taxi horns, with a subway station in the same black.\r\nOur room was bigger than most NYC hotel rooms. It was smartly decorated and spotlessly clean. Like all Westins, it featured the aptly named heavenly bed.\r\nThe second floor lobby bar is a great place to sip a martini and watch the parade of pedestrians flowing down 8th Avenue.\r\nIf I had to complain about something, it would be the cable TV news blaring inside the elevators. This unwanted noise seemed totally out of place in an otherwise tranquil refuge from the bustling city. I\'ll also file my usual complaint against large hotel chains that rip you off for $20 or more a day for high-speed internet access. The budget hotels all offer this for free, so why is it justified for high-priced hotels to gouge you for this service?\r\nNonetheless, this hotel is in my favorites file and I\'ll be back.'
4,'Very nice hotel','We had a really nice at this hotel, rooms had all been beautifully renovated, a little noisy because it is close to the FDNY and NYPD but no complaints otherwise, very friendly staff and great service.'
4,'Wonderful time at the Marriott Marquis....','My daughter and I stayed here 2/22 - 2/24 to celebrate her 6th birthday. We\'ve done the staying at a hotel w/ view of Central Park (Westin Essex) and wanted to experience a stay at a hotel w/ view of Times Square. Well first of all when I booked I requested a regular standard room figuring I would try my luck at check in and request an upgrade for free. Well, it worked. We got a free upgrade to a King size room on the 43rd Floor, that was very nice size, well maintained, ordinary nothing fancy, and of course w/ a fabulous fabulous Times Square view. My daughter was thrilled beyond words. So if anything it never hurts to ask.\r\nWe personally did not experience any real bad drama with the elevators. The most we waited was 5 minutes - which isn\'t too bad. The elevators that face outside w/ a view are a smooth, fast ride, but the inside elevators are not that great. We did get caught one time in an elevator crammed w/ people and no lie the elevator stopped just about on every floor. Which ,if you could imagine when having on a room on the 43rd floor, was annoying but people made light of it and so that made the ride bearable. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants nor order room service, so I can\'t voice any opinion on that. I will say that the service was great, everybody we encountered was very helpful. \r\nThe room rate at the Marriott is expensive, but my main objective in staying there was to get a room w/ view of TQ for my daughter and we also had tickets to see The Lion King so I wanted to be in the area for that as well. \r\nP.S. The Lion King was fantastic. Highly recommend seeing this show whether you have kids or not.\r\nAll in all our time at the Marriott Marquis was very enjoyable.'
5,'Très bon Hotel','Avons beaucoup apprécié le séjour dans cet hotel très bien situé pour visiter New York (6ème avenue à 2mn à pied de Central Park)\r\nChambre executive spacieuse et très bien équipée. Service efficace et personnel très serviable.\r\nJe recommande les chambres executive car elles sont situées en étages élevés ce qui est appréciable pour limiter le bruit provenant de la rue.\r\nDe plus, un salon spécial est prévu pour ce type de chambre où le petit déjeuner est proposé ainsi que des boissons et patisseries à partir de 17h (inclus dans le prix de la chambre).\r\nUne partie des chambres exécutive possède une superbe vue sur Central Park (penser à le demander lors de la réservation)\r\nHotel à recommander.'
4,'Fab hotel. Perfect location','Lovely room with 2 double beds. Bed was the most comfortable I\'ve ever slept in. No kettle in room which we could have done with, so take your own travel kettle. I\'d read that the rooms were small - ours certainly wasn\'t.\r\nLocation was perfect. Right next to Central Terminal. \r\nTourist information woman (Susan) in foyer was horrible. She tried to bully us into buying tickets for shows (obviously on a commission!) when all we wanted was information on bus tours and the Statue of Liberty. She was so rude.\r\nI would certainly book this hotel again.'
3,'Everlasting elevator problems','Like the others have said, this is a great hotel with horrible elevators. I stayed at this hotel in August 2001, and the elevators were just as bad then. When they were still just as bad in July 2005 and there appeared to be only three elevators servicing floors 27-45, we asked for an explanation. Evidently their high-tech elevator renovation was supposed to be done months ago, but the workers went on strike for over five months. The hotel says the renovation should be done soon, but I would recommend calling and asking about the progress before booking a room. If the renovation is ever complete and the elevators really work as well as promised, this would be a great hotel. It is in the heart of Times Square and has every imenity you would ever need or want. The recently renovated fitness center is amazing!'
4,'Very happy','I was at the Park Central for ten days, before during and after Hurricane Sandy, and I have to say the service I received throughout my stay really was impeccable. Staff were polite, friendly and helpful before the storm hit and remained extremely professional and courteous throughout the experience, which can\'t have been easy given everything they were dealing with.\r\nRooms are a good size, given the excellent location of the hotel and everything was nice and clean. I requested a coffee maker for my room which they were happy to provide and I was replenished quickly with fresh ground coffee whenever I requested it. A massive plus point for them in my mind.\r\nIt was unfortunate that there was no hot water for the last couple of days of my stay though I am not subtracting anything from my overall impression of the hotel as this was hardly their fault. \r\nThere is a pretty decent gym that is open 24 hours and was, until Sandy hit, almost deserted every time I used it. Of course the hotel is so close to Central Park that if you want exercise you usually have a much better option on your doorstep anyway...\r\nI do have an issue with the wifi charges you have to pay if you want a wifi connection in your room. I personally think this should be complimentary and find paying $14.10 every 24 hours when I need to use the internet for business irritating to say the least. \r\nThat said, I am in New York fairly often and will be going back, as in this instance, the positives far outweighed the negatives.'
4,'Great place to stay....except for the breakfast','I recently stayed here on a class trip and I have to say this place exceeded my expectations. I stayed in a double room and the room was a very good size for a hotel in New York and the beds were very comfy. The only downside was the noise of the air condition unit? outside. The hotel is beautiful and go to the bar, drinks are expensive but that doesn\'t really matter. We were in good walking distance of pretty much everything, if not then cab it or take the subway. Another thing is the breakfast price, it\'s pretty expensive so it\'s best going out for a coffee and bagel at the many places around. Also if looking for a place to eat I would say go to Bricco\'s which is on 304 W 56th Street, great, low price, Italian food'
5,'Great Hotel and Excellent Staff','I traveled to NYC on business and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Times Square for the first time on this trip. Although I have stayed at many Crowne Plaza Hotels, this specific location really wow\'d me!\r\nEverything was very clean and the hotel staff was nice, as I expect a Crowne Plaza to be. There was an issue with the heat in my room, it was too hot for me at 68 degrees. The staff was able to fix the temperature, but the front desk also sent a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to my room while I was away. I was very surprised by this and it was a very nice gesture.'
2,'Guest Service below par','This was a mother-daughter trip to NY.\r\nWe arrived early and were able to checkin, however after unpacking we noticed mold on the bedroom ceiling. We were leaving for lunch but stopped at the desk to inform them. They said they could move us to a new room and they would \'ready that room for another guest\' . No apology or concern shown and the fact that we were told they would just place another guest into that room was concerning (bad enough another guest will just be put into the room, but don\'t share that fact with the other guests!) [we dealt with a Mr. Williams who seemed to possibly be a Guest Services Manager but obviously needs futher training on guest relations].\r\nThe new room wasn\'t ready but they let us store our bags complimentary (we had to store them after checking out at a rate of $3.75/bag!!!!!). I had forgotten a toothbrush, but when we returned to the hotel that night the front desk brought a complimentary one up to my room (when I answered the door the person just handed me the toothbrush while talking on his cell phone and walked away.. usually I would tip for a delivery like this..). When I went to wash my face there were no face cloths. My mother said there were also no face cloths when she had stayed the year before. I called down to the desk, and the front desk agent seemed quite annoyed that I was calling with another request.. but after a large sigh said he would send them up. They never came.... until 9am the next morning. The second morning of our stay, the used face clothes had been taken away, but never replaced... at this point, we just decided to use the handtowels as face cloths.\r\nThe Park Central and its team definitely failed my expectations but the hotel itself and location were good, other than the feeling that we were staying at a hotel that could care less about their guests... (maybe because this is a high traffic hotel and they are not concerned with encouraging repeat guests or bad reviews).\r\nThe rooms were ok, the first one was small, but the second was larger and the flat screens are nice. Bellmen and doormen are very helpful. Next year we\'ll be staying at the Sheraton New York.\r\nTip: if you are going to be going to LAG airport, the Park Central offers a car service that is approx $45 including toll charge, tip, etc. Taking a taxi will work out to be almost equivalent, minus the better car, air conditioning, etc.... so opt for the car service!'
4,'Big, old-school NYC Hotel personal enough to really surprise me!','The Edison has been under new ownership for the past 2 years. Upon check in, I met a charming, soft spoken older gentleman who was just hanging around the registration area. He told me a bit of the hotel history and then mentioned he OWNED it! Our 17th floor room was high enough to be above the street noise, but that didn\'t help getting a good night\'s sleep. I think our bed was an original 1937 that had only hardened with age. Next morning, I mentioned it to the front desk. Upon a quick mid-afternoon return, I found a crew outfitting our room with a brand new king bed! And who just happened to be wandering the halls of the 17th floor..........the owner! Well done! PS. The Edison Cafe cofee shop is famous. A Neil Simon play was written about it.'
5,'Amazing ambiance,','Stayed there for business and returned for leisure. An amzing decor and reasonably priced when booking with the right site. Located in the heart of downtown, it is a beautiful place to stay.'
2,'Great location and shower heads, but the rest gets a C-','Three nights over a weekend in May 2009. Too expensive for what you get. Converted chopped-up apt. bldg surrounding LOUD bar courtyard. Noise still a problem at 14th floor (we set the A/C to fan to block noise. Worked because the headboard IS the A/C unit!!) Tiny, tiny, rooms, almost laughable, but there is a vestibule for luggage. But awful queen mattress. \r\n Desk staff OK but the WORST doorman in NYC. And I mean the worst. Great for party animals that drink like fish but the ave. temp in the bars both nights was upper 80\'s, no joke. Weird.'
4,'Very nice central hotel','Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife and 9 year old daughter. We loved the close location to Times Square and all the New York attraction. We had a room on the 38th floor so had a great view down to Times Square and the Empire State. We didn\'t have breakfast so can\'t comment, but we did have dinner which was fine, but you can get better outside the hotel. Staff very friendly and professional and are all very proud of their hotel. Good size room for New York with nice beds and shower. Check out was 4pm which is very unusual. Would be very happy to stay again and recommend to anyone.'

4,'huge room, clean, quiet hotel and friendly staff','stayed for 4 nights recently. We were able to check in early which was great after a long flight! Our room was on the 26th floor and was extremely quiet, no noise from ajoining rooms. the room was clean and nicely decorated, and it was massive!!! Throughout our stay the staff we met were extremely helpful and friendly. It was close to Times Square and we were able to walk to all attractions.\r\nWe enjoyed our stay and would use this hotel again.'
5,'Ottimo albergo!!!','Siamo stati al Crowe Plaza una settimana per il nostro viaggio di nozze....che dire....bellissimo albergo, camere grandi e confortevoli e molto pulite.\r\nLetto grande e comodissimo e ce`pure la macchina x fare il caffe`.\r\nBagno pulito e moderno.\r\nOttima la posizione propio in centro Time Square...meglio di cosi!!!\r\nNoi stavamo al 36 piano e da li non si sentiva nessun rumore.\r\nMolte attrazioni e i negozi x lo shopping sono tutti raggiungibili a piedi e i teatri a pochi passi...davvero fantastico!!!!\r\nNew York mi manca gia e nn vedo l`ora di poterci tornare.'
4,'très bon rapport situation-qualité-prix','Cet hôtel est à un tarif abordable et très bien situé, face au Marriott. Il n\'est pourtant pas bruyant.\r\nLe seul inconvénient est la salle de bain plutôt vétuste. Au petit déjeuner, plusieurs menus à des tarifs très compétitifs : j\'ai cherché sans trouver mieux. Personnel courtois.'
3,'Great location, needs soundproofing...','We stayed for 3 nights at the start of February. As a Hilton HHonors member we were put on the 17th floor in a recently renovated room. The hotel room was spacious for new york, and the location cannot be faulted. However...the walls are seriously thin. We could hear people wandering back to their rooms at 1am, we heard our neighbours alarm clock every morning, and we could hear taxis honking their horn. I appreciate that its New York and that\'s what taxi drivers do, but I have stayed in other hotels in New York where this has not been a problem.\r\nI would say go - but take your earplugs!!'
5,'Had an outstanding stay here!','I spent four nights at the Marriott Marquis NYC at the beginning of June 2009 and was absolutely impressed. I had booked a Times Square view room via a AAA special, and when I got to the room and found a mediocre south-facing view I was able to talk to the manager on duty and promptly and politely changed to a jetliner view room on a high floor facing directly north into Times Square. One of those views to die for. The room itself was large, clean and had all the expected amenities and the staff I met, no matter the department, was polite and friendly. The location is as perfect as it gets. The elevator situation was not a problem at all during my stay as I rarely waited more than a few minutes for one, and the hotel seemed fairly crowded. Overall I found the Marriott to be outstanding in every respect and would not hesitate to stay here again (and will probably do so on all my future visits to NYC).\r\nKen Ackerman'
4,'Best Place to Stay','The room was very comfortable, however the room location was not ideal. The window over looks an empty space where air conditioner were. There were no city view from there.'
1,horrible,'The only good thing about this hotel is the location which is excellent. Otherwise the desk staff were ineffiecient, the clerk could barely speak English. The other staff were surly and rude, especially those at the tour desk, needless to say we didn;t use those facitlities. The room was small and cramped, okay it is an old building, but the fixtures and fittings were broken and the room dirty, there was even mould growing in the refrigerator. The linen and towels were worn out, and had holes in them. The ice machines didn\'t work. There was no directory of hotel facitlites, or local attractions. In short an hotel to avoid.'
1,'WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN','We stayed in this hotel from Sun 17th Jan to fri 22nd. We arrived NY time 12:30 noon after an 8 hour flight to be greeted with a very cold welcome, we were told our room was not yet ready and a curtesy room was not avilable. After walking around in the cold and the pouring rain for a couple of hours we were told the room was still not ready and check in was not till 4p.m so we were not going to get into it before then no matter what.!! There were no tea or coffee facillities in the rooms and the view we had was of 4 brick walls. We could not tell if it was day or night , sunny or raining. Every morning we had to look up to the sky to see what the weather was like and we could not wait to leave the room. We stayed out all day as it was so depressing. When we went to check out we were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay, if we were happy or unhappy, if we had enjoyed our first trip to NY.. the staff were very unhospitable and cold. I would go to NY again as the place itself was FANTASTIC,there is so much to see and do that 5 days is just not enough..and the majority of American people we met and spoke with were lovely but this hotel is a definate NO NO and we would not recommend it to ANYONE .'
4,'Nice modern hotel and great location','The hotel is located next to Grand Central station. It is a nice modern hotel with a large lobby. The room was sufficient but the bathroom was a tad on the small side. A clean hotel with friendly staff. Would stay here again.'
5,'Very pleasant hotel experience','I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. The front desk and bell staff were very courteous and helpful. At check-in, we were offered an upgraded room. The room was spaceous, clean, quiet & tastefully decorated. The location is very convenient. The lobby is beautifully decorated. Couldn\'t ask for a better hotel experience.'
2,'Front desk staff always abrasive.','I stay at this hotel for business meetings nearby at Rockefeller Plaza. I consistently have had problems with staff at the front desk even in the HHonors Executive line. They usually get the reservation wrong even when paying for upgrade in advance. Consistently condescending, argumentative & patronizing attitude. Unlike the great staff at the sister Waldorf Hotel a few blocks away. What a world of difference in how the same Hilton chain treats its frequent customers. \r\nI know this Hilton hotel well enough to make an advance request for executive level room away from the noisy elevator bell or stairwells/ice machines. When I get there, the request usually goes lost. When I have to call HHonors Customer Service after recent my arrivals to fix things with a manager, that usually means the front desk staff needs retraining. I think I\'m staying at the Waldorf from now on. Its a shame, because the great convenience of the Hilton NY location has been dimmed for me.'
4,'Location is perfect!','We went to New York City after Christmas for a few days and had a great time. I used miles to stay at the Marriott Marquis, because the regular rates are too expensive. If you can use miles or get some sort of deal then it is a great place to stay. It is right in the heart of Times Square, across the street from the TKTS 1/2 price broadway ticket booth, and very close to the theaters, shops and restaurants. The hotel has advantages and disadvantages. The rooms are very nice; this is a huge and beautiful property, but you are not going to get any personal service. I have twin 18 year old daughters and called for extra towels a couple of times and never got them. But I understand that it was very busy, and you have to lower your expectations a bit. We saw Voca people, an off-broadway show about an acapela singing group, which was funny and very good. We all enjoyed the show!'
2,'No Service','I have the Hyatt Gold Passport and generally speaking I\'m quite satisfied but I will never return to this Hotel...\r\nI booked two rooms for 4 days this hotel four months in advance asking to get those at the same floor, when we arrived they proposed two rooms but at different floors, finally after a long discussion they provide us two rooms (one was King when we asked for our two teens a two Queens). \r\nBefore NY we were at the Hyatt Regency in Los Angeles where we spend a great time and we had a very good service even if the Hotel was expensive, we knew it .\r\nAfter a good night, reception called us and asked us to move to two other rooms at an other floor to due some issues with the water, they mentionned that they will manage our luggage if we packed before leaving, in compensation they gave us breakfast coupons for the duration of our stay. The inconvenient is that you have to spend at least 1 hour to get your breakfast....\r\nWhen we return on the evening they gave us two rooms but at different floors, we refused and asked for two rooms at the same floor after two hours discussions they finally found two rooms for us but they didn\'t find our luggages, it took them (I\'m saying them because we were obliged to ask several receptionnist before getting some attention) two hours to find it...\r\nWe had no glass in the bathroom, six hangers, no slippers...for a 5* Hotel, it\'s amaizing...\r\nThis is a business hotel, everything is charged...\r\nFor our departure we have been obliged to pay 2$ per items for the hotel to keep our luggages.\r\nUnder the concierge recommendation, we aked the bell man for a taxi to go to the Newark Airport but it seems that it was too complicate for him and he said that the best way is to take the Hotelcar,it will be the same price around $85 plus tax but when we arrived at the Airport the driver asked for 120$.... an advise don\'t trust the Hyatt employees for them you are just a banker and you should pay...\r\nOther than that the Hotel is well situated...'
4,'Bien situado y confortable','Bueno, por lo visto voy a repetir lo que dice todo el mundo:\r\n- El hotel esta bien situado, cerca de Brodway y Times Square, ademas tienes la linea Azul del metro justo en la esquina y a menos de una manzana la linea Roja.\r\n- Es ideal si vas a New York poco tiempo pues esta en el centro.\r\n- Las habitaciones no son tan grandes como parecen en la foto pero son aceptables teniendo en cuenta lo caro que es el m2 en NY y sobretodo con camas comodas y limpias.\r\n- En general bien, como detalle hay plantas con maquinas de hielo, imagino que si te toca una habitación cerca y tienes sueño ligero puede ser un problema.'
4,'Great place all around','I am a frequent traveller to NYC and have stayed @ Park Central many times now. The service I have recieved has been top notch. Rooms are of great value with very comftorable beds and linen. Location is excellent for business and even better to take in many of New Yorks finest attractions. Could use a free wi fi area however but the starbucks next door can solve this. I look forward to many continiued stays. \r\nDennis'
1,'There\'s Small and then there\'s ridiculous','Ok...really...who decided to call this place a hotel? I\'ve been to NYC dozens of times and stayed in dozens of places, small and large. This place is absurd. Your reservation should include a disclaimer against those with claustrophobia.\r\nThe room is (and I\'m not kidding) 210 square feet which includes the bathroom, narrow hallway and the closet. And this is the upgrade! The actual living space is about 10 X 10. - just enough room for the bed.\r\nI booked the hotel on priceline for 140. Had to pay a $60 upgrade and I still feel like I\'m in an inside cabin on a cruise ship.\r\nPriceline has a lot of nerve as does the hotel for calling this a room when it isn\'t much bigger than a walk in closet.'
5,'Outstanding Times Sq/Central Park location','I stayed on and off for 10+ nights for business in May 2012 here. Before arrival, my needs needed some change nearly every time, but staff and senior managers were very responsive and were able to address my needs every time! Elizabeth, a senior customer manager is an absolute charm and extremely helpful during my stays. She helped with all questions with patience. I watched her help so many people with such grace and efficiency. NYC and its top hotel location front desks can be crazy at all times, but nearly all staff at Park Central seemed patient and professional. Thanks also to Tony in reservations! Cleaning staff, valet, concierge and porter help all excellent. Rooms, furniture and bathrooms may require minor updating, but for a prime location this hotel is doing its best to keep customers coming back. I certainly will.'
3,'Solo per la posizione','location location location: central park 5 min, line NQR to the side of the hotel. The room, if compared with the lobby which makes u some expectations, a bit disappointing. By the way it was cleaned, which means a lot to me. Never tried breakfast o the reastaurant. \r\nThe consierge: super! Anthony: outstanding. Lisa Wood: very kind, but she could had spared \'your english is not so good\'... I didn\'t undestand you only because partially deaf :) \r\nMany thanks also to the driver\'s the hotel hired for the trasfert to the jfk: Christopher Lucciani.\r\nse vi capita di andare... non aspettatevi chissa cosa: c\'è moquette ovunque, a parte nel bagno. Abbiamo pernottato per 5 notti, lasciato loro la belleza di 2700 dollari... e non avrei mai creduto che per lasciare il bagaglio avrei dovuto pagare, ancora. lavoro anche io in un hotel e teniamo bagagli per tutta la durata del giorno gratuitamente.'
4,'Vert good hotel excellent value. :-)','Booked this hotel for location and price, paid extra for room with a view and then e mailed to ask if we could have a corner room with view of empire state and was not disappointed (room 3610). Checkin was really quick and efficient room was ready. 2 double beds very comfortable but shorter than a standard bed, views to die for, tv, full size iron and ironing board in room. Bathroom was small and a bit dated but fine and has a hair dryer. security is spot on even checking for your room card before getting into lift. All staff and cleaners were pleasant and professional. I have recommended this hotel to others who have now booked it and would stay here again without a doubt! Thank you new yorker for a fabulous stay.'
5,'EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING!','I checked into the hotel on Thanksgiving Day and the moment I arrived I was treated like a Queen. Everything was perfect. The clerk at the front desk couldn\'t have been anymore accomodating. The room was beautiful, large and very clean. The employees, especially Steve and Maramadou on the 23rd floor were exceptional. The hotel is incredible. Some 35-40 years ago my husband and I stayed there...since that time he has passed away...but I do remember the ornate door knobs in the bathroom. I was there Thursday, Friday and had to leave on Saturday. Your hotel will always be the hotel of my choice. I thank you for the opportunity I had to spend Thanksgiving there. I will tell my friends and I will always stay there when I come to Chicago.'
2,'Nice hotel, horrible construction noise','Let me start off by saying this hotel is absolutely beautiful. The ceiling in the lobby in incredible and the interior overall is superb. I would definitely come back to this hotel after the renovations are complete. If it weren\'t for the contruction noise, I would have given this hotel 4 stars easy.\r\nMy experience staying in the hotel is a different story. When we arrived, we were told the elevators were not working in the main entrance. So my husband and I had to drag our luggage up the stairs to the lobby. It was only two flights of stairs and we can handle it but we wondered how an elderly or handicapped person would get to their room. There were bellman but there were also 20 or so people waiting for their services. The check in process was fine and finding our room was easy so no problems there. Once we got in the room, we realized the walls were paper thin. I suggested getting another room because of our noisy neighbors but we decided to stick it out. Little did we know what we would wake up to the next morning. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK. That\'s the sound of hotel renovations. It\'s high pitched and loud. Enough to make any dog want to howl. We tried to drown it out with the fan in the room to no avail. Then the drilling started. This was 7am. We just decided to get up because obviously, the noise would not be ending anytime soon. This went on every morning we were there. We were out of the room during the days so we are not sure how long this went on. \r\nOn a positive note, the rooms were very clean, updated and housekeeping always kept the room stocked with fresh coffee and towels. I didn\'t have to ask for anything. The concierge was very helpful when we needed directions and many times suggested alternatives in order to save time. Overall, housekeeping, concierge, doormen, and the reservation desk offered great service. \r\nWe had a studio room and other reviewers have suggested they are closet sized rooms. Well, sign me up for that closet! The studios are much larger than people are suggesting. I would put them at about 15\'x18\'. Not huge but not tiny either. I never felt cramped. We had a king instead of two doubles so maybe they are referring to a studio with two doubles. There is plenty of room for 1-2 people in a studio. If you have kids, I would suggest a larger room though.\r\nA good restaurant I would suggest is Miller\'s Pub. It\'s near the hotel on Wabash between Monroe and Adams. We wanted a bite to eat late at night and when other places were closed, they were still serving at 11pm on a Tuesday. It\'s Zagat rated too! The sidewalk is being worked on (another cause of noise in the room) so the restaurants on Wabash aren\'t getting as much business. Try the fish and chips. You won\'t regret it.'
5,'I\'m in love with this hotel, the best experience ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!','I could not have asked for a better hotel, staff, service or anything else. The Westin is the classiest hotel I have ever stayed in, I would choose this hotel over the Plaza. The location is amazing, the staff especially Chris who works the night shift is amazing, we were stuck without a place to stay and he accomodated us at 12:00 a.m. and took care of everything we needed for the rest of this trip. I will stay at the Westin on every trip I go on in the future in any city especially NYC.'
4,'Week end trip','Perfect location, very nice staff, rooms could be larger but were very clean and easy to get to.\r\ngreat restaurants.\r\nWe did not have hot water at the hotel for part of the afternoon and evening because a gas pipe was damage a block away. We did not get any notice about it until we got in the shower.\r\nAlso hotel did not make any excuses or even offers of a drink or meal because of the inconvenience.'
5,'Best Hotel I Have ever stayed in - who cares if the rooms are small?!*','The entrance to this hotel is really like no other - up an escalator in a fluorescent yellow lit hallway. If you appreciate good design this is the hotel for you. Phillipe Starck has done himself proud!\r\nTo come him from the QT was such a relief! We arrived at 11am, but our room was ready so we checked in & went & explored the hotel, then the area - right next to Central Park.\r\nI loved this hotel so much I don\'t really know what else to say, it looked amazing, the staff were lovely - we got a late checkout, they had a whole floor for luggage storage; the bar on the roof was not overpriced - the rooms were like being on a luxury boat or something - everyone who writes about the Hudson seems to moan about the rooms being small - but who on earth comes to NYC to stay in their room?\r\nEverything was clean & new & lovely - Oh I just loved it & yes the rooms are small but they are not as small as you would imagine - I was prepared for the worst! And it is just such a spectacular Hotel it is worth putting up with the \'compact\' rooms!\r\nSo much better than the QT that they just don\'t even fall into the same category - oh & the Hudson cost us less than the QT!! I wish we had stayed here for the whole duration of our trip....\r\nStay there - really stay there!!!!!!!'
5,'Couldn\'t have wished for more','Just returned from a 5-night stay in the Southgate Tower Hotel and\r\nhad a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect, the staff very friendly with nothing a problem to them. The room was well appointed and spotlessly clean and as requested we had a view of the Empire State building and Madison Square Garden. The bar/restaurant below - Niles -was also great; very stylish and modern with wonderful service and very reasonable prices. The location of The Southgate Tower is perfect for the tourist visitor - within 5 mins walking distance to both the Empire State building and Times Square and ith numerous shops and food outlets in the surrounding area. As it\'s located right opposite Penn Station travelling is also made easy. Many European airline crews stay here which gives an indication of the good comfort and safety standards of the hotel. I couldn\'t recommend it any higher.'
4,'Great location!','I stayed here during a recent trip with my mom and sister. It was a quick and easy taxi ride from LaGuardia and the location is perfect. If you are looking to see a lot in a short period of time, this is the spot for you. It is perfectly located in the heart of Times Square close to all of the theatres, excellent dinning and an easy walk to central park. It is also very conveniently located to the tour bus stops so we were able to do several tours. The hotel was busy but the rooms were comfortable and quiet. The hotel staff was very nice and the concierge gave great dinning advice. We would definitely stay again!'
4,'A nice stay in an excellent location','My wife and I stayed for a long weekend, and we chose the Westin because of its proximity to Times Square and the Broadway shows. It didn\'t disappoint. We stayed on the 38th floor. Rooms are nice in size and are quiet. It\'s expensive but worth the extra price.'
4,'Pretty Good','Well I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out better than the reviews implied. Very good location right next to Grand Central station. Room good, we asked for and got a room with a superking bed and a roll up for our daughter (11) Aircon worked ok. Lobby huge and er 80\'s check in and out efficient.\r\nWould stay again.'
4,Trendy,'On arrival at JFK, our taxi took us straight into the city. He did search to find this hotel as there is no signage at all! It felt quite strange heading up an escalator going somewhere and coming out in the hip lobby area. The decor is trendy and well done throughout the hotel, but we preferred to eat outside of the hotel - the style of food was not for us. Although the rooms are comfortable, we found the bedroom/bathroom very small, so we did not spend that much time there, except to sleep.It is very close to Central Park and many of the things we were keen to do and see, were in the immediate area.'
1,'Dont stay here!!','Well the only decent thing I could say about this hotel is the fantastic location. We stayed on the 13th floor and the view was of the back wall of the hotel... not great when you are staying in the most amazing city in the world.\r\nThe room was dusty and looked like it was from a scene out of the 80\'s movie and need of a serious upgrade. The bed was clean but not good. The shower was warm and powerfull but the bathroom needed a good clean. \r\nOverall i wouldnt stay here if you could help it as its not the best ,when for a bit extra money you could have that little bit extra!'
4,'Loved it','The very small bathroom is my only reservation , otherwise it rated an excellent. Our room was spacious with 2 double beds..(not requested). 2 closets, 2 dressers, and most shocking, a view of the Hudson through several generous windows. The hotel nicely renovated and looks cared for.\r\nThe 24 hr diner, tick tock had the usual massive Greek-diner-menu. Fair prices with generous portions. Breakfast was our only experience and it kept us going until 2pm every day. \r\nPerfect location, subway/buses close by. I will return!'
4,'Si quieres un hotel bien situado y con buenas vistas','Es un hotel perfecto para una primera estancia en Nueva York, habitaciones cómodas y amplias, perfecto punto de partida para conocer la ciudad y/o para ir a un espectáculo en Broadway, justo encima de Times Square, estupendas vistas por su altura y situación. Cama cómoda, muy tranquilo para la zona en la que está, limpio y buen servicio. Elige una habitación alta si puedes. Las habitaciones que hacen esquina son estupendas, con un gran ventanal y muy amplio.'
5,'Great Hotel in perfect location for theater goers','The Marriott Marquis in Times Square if you are going to New York to see the shows. The staff is very accommodating an helpful. Rooms are ultra comfortable with all amenities one would need. However, the location is the best for those who come to New York to see shows every night. Most theaters are very walkable, and a few only steps away. There are multiple restaurants in the hotel, and certainly plenty of large and small places around the area for dining. We discovered the bar on the top floor of the Marriott one night after a play, which has a perfect, light late night menu for appetizers, full meals. The restaurant/bar are both open until at least 1:00 am. Transportation to theaters is easy as taxis are always available, and of course the subway station there is very convenient. Highly recommend this hotel for those who enjoy Times Square and/or going to theater multiple times during a visit.'
5,'A brilliant hotel','I don’t know what some of the other travelers are talking about this hotel not being clean! This is a super hotel, in a great location, one block off Times Square. We took the express bus from the airport to the Port Authority, around the corner from the hotel, for $22 return. A big saving on taxis It took 30 minutes. at 9am. We arrived with our two children (7&11) for a weeks stay, and were upgraded to room on 36 floor with great views of the Hudson River. The air-conditioned room was spacious and clean, with iron, hair dryer, tv etc. The two large twin beds were ‘heavenly’ as advertised and a real godsend after a long days walking, in the summer heat.\r\nThe staff were friendly, extremely helpful, polite, and courteous.\r\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to others, and would not hesitate to stay there again.'
5,'Fantastic base for seeing New York','We booked this hotel based on its location as we wanted to be in the centre of all the action and it didn\'t disappoint. The service was just what you\'d expect in a good hotel and everywhere was spotless and clean. We would definitely recommend staying here to anyone coming to the big apple.'
2,'Great location, but ...','The location of the Park Central is perfect for visiting Central Park, Time Square, and Rock Center. The hotel was more like an old college dorm. The biggest surprise was the bathroom door doesn\'t open all the way. The toilet is positioned right in the middle of the room and blocks the door from opening more than half way. If you were a large person, pregnant, or carrying a child you would have great difficulty getting into the bathroom. I\'ve never seen anything like it. The housekeeping service was good and the room was clean even though dated. The concierge on duty in the afternoon was rude and not helpful to us. We tried three times to get help from him and gave up. We ended up asking the doormen for help and they were great.'
4,'Best located hotel we stayed at','We got a great deal via Priceline and got to stay at this hotel for two nights. Like the first NY hotel we won before, the room was one of the smaller ones facing another hotel. We noticed a small stain on one of the sheets. We kindly asked for another sheet and the manager apologized and offered an upgrade. The next night we got the most amazing suite with a huge room and living room. The best part about staying in huge hotels like this is they have the resources to make sure you have the best experience during your stay. They also store your luggage for a small fee, so if this happens to be the last leg of your trip, it\'s still a perfect location to store your bags, go about town, and come back to pick it up before heading off to your next destination.'
4,'Another great stay!','This will be the third time we\'ve states at the palmer house Hilton and i doubt very much that we will ever stay elsewhere in chicago. Though for some reason the place felt a little shabby this time?? The lobby is magnificent but looked like it could do with a spring clean and the room was pleasant albeit a tad basic compared to the last two times. We did have a lovely view from the window though and the location is fantastic and handy for the El train to and from the airport.'
3,'Decent stay in one-bedroom suite','I stayed with my wife and two young children in a one bedroom suite (room 4325) at Hilton New York for four nights from March 11 to 15, 2006. The rate we paid was US$479 per night before taxes.\r\nThe room itself was clean and nicely decorated. There were little hints here and there in the room that the hotel has been around a long time, but most of the furnishings were probably only about four years old.\r\nWe had a one-bedroom suite which had two double beds and a TV in the bedroom, a very small bathroom off the bedroom, a living room with a couch (with pull-out bed) in the living room, as well as one chair in the living room plus a second chair at a desk, and a kitchenette with a sink and a micro fridge plus a minibar.\r\nThe room was not what was advertised on the Hilton web site. The Hilton web site has a picture of a very large living room with a six-seat dining table off to the side. Our living room, while nice, was small and did not include a dining table. It was just not as grand as advertised. This was disappointing given the rate we paid. But, it was still acceptable and mostly clean.\r\nWhile the living room was smaller than I expected, the bedroom was a good size, maybe slightly larger than average for New York City.\r\nThere was no electrical outlet in the bathroom. This meant you had to take the portable hair dryer included in the bathroom out to another room to make it work.\r\nWhile the suite was mostly clean, there were a number of light stains in the carpet.\r\nAs it was a suite, it was automatically on one of the executive floors (43rd floor). The executive lounge, where we checked in, and ate a continental breakfast a couple of times, was on the 44th floor and was large, open and well lit, and had lots of tables and (continental) breakfast food and juices.\r\nThe elevators were not a problem and were fairly fast as they had rows of elevators for different groups of floors.\r\nWe parked our car using valet parking at the parking garage on 53rd street. If you come east down the one-way 54th street, you will have to bypass the hotel which is on the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and go to Fifth Avenue, turn right onto Fifth Avenue and then immediately right again onto 53rd street, which is a one-way street headed west, then you will pass Avenue of the Americas while still on 53rd Street, then before you get to Seventh Avenue you will turn right into a parking garage that is part of the building that contains the Hilton.\r\nWe ate breakfast once in the hotel restaurant New York Marketplace, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfast was a little expensive, and though acceptable in taste, it was not great.\r\nThere is a business office on the second floor of the hotel, but it is not run by the hotel. You can use a computer there with internet access for $15 for 10 minutes.\r\nThere is a great grocery store called Ernest Klein & Co. International Supermarket between 54th and 55th streets (one street north of the Hilton), on the opposite side of the Avenue from the Hilton, at 1366 Avenue of the Americas. By great I don\'t mean the prices, I mean the selection. It is good to have a full grocery store nearby and not just a deli with limited selection.\r\nI would recommend the hotel for its location. You can walk to Central Park, to Times Square, and Fifth Avenue shopping.\r\nAs for other tips about NYC, my favorite meal was at Virgil\'s Real BBQ on 44th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.\r\nA fun stop was at the Ecomony Candy store on 108 Rivington Street in the East Village, which was piled high with almost every candy you can imagine, and where we walked to after eating a great breakfast at the Clinton St. Baking Company. We then walked from Economy Candy to visit the soon to be demolished CBGB rock n\' roll club on Bleeker & Bowery.\r\nI would advise you to buy your Empire State Building tickets online before you go (you don\'t commit to a specific use date when you buy them online) as you can then avoid the ticket purchase line when you get to the building.\r\nA fun place to visit if you have kids is Deb\'s Family Disco in Manhattan.\r\nThe Grey Line bus tour is top-notch and a must see for a visit to Manhattan.\r\nThe Burger Joint makes the best burgers I have ever had. It is secretly located in Le Parker Meridien hotel on 57th Street and Avenue of the Americas. I say secret location as it is not advertised and has no obvious signage except for a little neon hamburger that you can see if you peer down a dark hallway, between the check-out desk and a lage curtain in the lobby of Le Parker Meridien hotel. This is within easy walking distance of the Hilton New York.\r\nPhotos of my Hilton room (one bedroom suite #4325) are attached.'
4,'Great location','Hotel in great location in NYC. Very clean. Friendly staff.'
4,'Room with a view','Having never been to New York before we decided that for the short three day stay we\'d be better off in the middle of town rather than out in the village etc. All the hotels of any reputation and quality looked to be expensive, but the strong UK pound against the dollar mitigated a lot of that for us.\r\nI opted for the Westin as part of the Starwood group (even though in the end I didn\'t have enough points for a single night !!) - they are a known quantity in terms of room quality, service and specifically the Heavenly beds are to die for - If you don\'t intend to spend a lot of time in a hotel except to sleep...then you might as well make sure its a good bed.\r\nThe 42nd floor Corner Deluxe room with aspects to East and South was exactly as expected and had great views of Times Square and the Empire State Building. There was loads of space in and around the bed, plenty of wardrobe space and a good size desk for working at. Also a large and excellent plasma TV with a good range of TV channels - not that we watched it. \r\nThe bathroom was a little clinical with its stainless steel basin and fittings, but good toiletries, nice towels and robes, made up for all that, and the all important shower - double head, hot water and plenty of pressure - was great.\r\nCheck in went like clockwork with an attentive and friendly staff. Some problems with internet access during the stay, but customer services were very efficient in confirming there was a problem and in immediately offering to zero the item on my bill for the rest of our stay. A slight glitch on the express checkout bill trying to charge me again for the room even though it was already paid for, but the front desk bill was zero so all\'s well that ends well.\r\nGreat stay and would stay again. The 4/5 rating is mainly down to the cost...but maybe that\'s unfair given that no hotel of that quality and location was going to cost any less. \r\nI would be hesitant about booking anything but a high numbered floor...even on the 42nd floor, traffic noise from the Port Authority bus terminal and the roads around was noticable, but a for room to room noise mentioned by other reviewers...we didn\'t hear a thing!'
5,'Fabulous stay!','My husband and I stayed at the Hilton New York for 8 nights from 27th December 2011 - 4th January 2012. It was our first time in New York and was perfectly located for sightseeing. We stayed in a deluxe king room and had a lovely view from our window. The room itself was incredibly spacious, particularly when compared to other NYC hotels, and was extremley comfortable - particularly after a long day in the city.\r\nWe didnt eat within the hotel as we did find it expensive, especially for breakfast. However, there are plenty of places to eat within the area. In fact, upon contacting hotel concierge prior to our trip, they kindly emailed us a whole list of nearby restaurants and delis varying in price and cuisine.\r\nThe staff within the hotel were also extremely friendly and accomodating. \r\nIf I could change one thing about the hotel, it would be the charge for the use of the gym facility. Having paid a lot of money for our stay, I did not expect to pay additional costs to use the gym.\r\nHowever, I would definately recommend the Hilton New York - it is a perfect hotel for your stay in NYC, and we cannot wait to return in the near future : )'
4,'Fantastic Birthday Surprise','My husband booked our first stay in New York as a 50th birthday surprise and the hotel delivered in almost every way. Just a couple of negatives. The receptionist said she would upgrade us but we only got what we had paid for!!! The room was excellent, the bed - well just \'heavenly\' and the views from the 29th floor just amazing! My only other gripe is the huge charge for the internet and the fact that the business centre delivered a fax to our room 4 days after they received it!!! We never ate in the restaurant or drank in the bar due to the prices but there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby so it really wasn\'t a problem. Perfect location too. If the hotel offer any good deals we will certainly be back here next time we visit New York!'
4,'Great location for walking to Times Square and Central Park!!','My wife and I stayed at the Weston Times Square for 2 nights, and had a wonderful time. Check-in was seamless, quick and handled by a knowledgable and friendly person. Bags were delivered immediately to our room. Rooms were clean and very nice as expected of a Westin. Concierge was knowledgable, helpful and quick to make reservations for us. Check out was also seamless. Quality of personnel - not an issue - top notch!! Location, however, is this hotels strongest suit. Times Square is out your window, and Central Park was a comfortable walk for us (age 50). Theatre District right around the corner. Would do it again in a heart-beat!!'
5,'Affordable and good located','This hotel is situation in the heart of the city.\r\nI\'ve been staying there every time I\'ve traveled to New York City.\r\nAnd I\'ve always enjojed my stay.\r\nThe rooms are comfortable, clean and nicely furnished.\r\nWith prices from $200 per night, the hotel is quite affordable.\r\nWhile you\'re staying you can surfe the net for free at a tolerable speed.\r\nI\'d totaly recomend the New Yorker Hotel to everyone because it\'s a hotel worth spending the vaccation in.'
5,'Would definately recommend this hotel - central location with great rooms and views','We stayed for a week and loved returning to the hotel after all day sightseeing. We were able to walk or take the subway (from across the road) to all the places we wanted to visit. Room was spotlessly clean, quiet and had fabulaous views across the Hudson. The rooms are small but perfectly servicable with some of the original 20\'s character retained. The hotel is busy, friendly not pretensious or stuffy.The staff were great. The original Art Deco styling can be seen all over the hotel especially in the lobby and it is great to see this living history given a new lease of life. Definately recommend a walk around Central Park it is beautifiul, clean and safe. Also the Met - could easily spend a day in there. We had a great time and we are hooked on NYC. Thanks to to all at the New Yorker - you are doing a great job and we hope to return.'
4,'Great Location!','My new husband and I Stayed at the affinia for four nights as part of our honeymoon. Check in was quick and easy and the gentleman on reception had a bottle of wine brought to our room to celebrate the special occasion. The room was small but plenty of space for two also it was cleaned daily to a very high standard. Safe and fridge in the room very handy. My husband used the gym and coffee maker every morning, said the gym was small but fine adequate. Hotel is Easily within walking distance of times square (15mins) Macy\'s (2 mins) and empire state (5 mins). Plenty of places to eat nearby. Concergiage very helpful with the queries I had. A little street noise but I\'m a light sleeper and slept very well with earplugs. No noise from inside the hotel. Overall a great base for exploring a fabulous city.'
1,'Good location, bad everything else','I never go to the trouble of giving bad reviews to hotels, restaurants, bars, etc. However, in the case of Hotel Pennsylvania, I\'m more than willing to make an exception. This place was/is an absolute dump. I understand the appeal of an historic hotel in NYC, but I have no tolerance for old, ratty linens, dirty bathrooms, non-working lights, missing amenities (i.e. ironing board), and just a general lack of being with the times. \r\nThe room was $120 for one night, which, by NYC standards, is cheap. Holiday Inn Express was the exact same price, and I wish I had gone with them instead of Hotel Pennsylvania. I\'m not what anyone would call a frequent traveler, so any hotel losing my business is far from an issue for them. However, I hope I can influence anyone else that is even considering this place. If you enjoy staying at any hotel with modern amenities and acceptable upkeep/cleanliness, DO NOT stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Consider yourselves forewarned :)'
5,'Crowne Plaza helped make our 40th anniversary','Have just returned to UK after three nights at the Crowne Plaza, floor 21 overlooking Times Square, so a great position to do everything you want in this amazing city. We were staying to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and I cannot say enough to thank the staff for their wonderful hospitality. The trip was arranged by my son but the hotel had arranged surprise wine and food in our room, a glass of champagne awaited us at an NY eatery they had recommended, we also had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurant, a great snack and lively buzz in the bar/lolunge, great assistance in the hotel lounge suite, and the friendliness of all concerned made it a magical memory for our first trip to NY. Highly recommend this hotel and a verybig thankyou to everyone. We will return one day........'
4,'Marriott Marquis Times Square -Great Location for Tourists','I spent 2 nights this past week at the Marquis. I was in NYC for a training and spent a Wednesday & Thursday night. I got a government rate due to my job so my rate was significantly cheaper than the going rate and I booked directly through Marriott.com.\r\nI took Amtrak in to Penn Station and I am pretty comfortable traveling around NYC so I took the subway, 1 stop to Times Square and then a couple block walk to the hotel. \r\nThe check-in desk in on the 8th floor which was a bit odd, but no big deal. Check-in was far and away the worst part of the whole stay. 3 clerks were working when I arrived, each was busy. A line formed behind me as we waited for our turn. 2 of the 3 clerks were dealing with different problems with the guests. The 3rd clerk finally finished with their guest and told us to wait for someone else, and he walked away. That was really annoying. I proceeded to wait a total of 15 minutes before I was checked in. Too long to wait at 8pm at night after traveling and with luggage. (Frankly, too long to wait any time of the day!) The clerk who checked me in did not impress me with his customer service, but I wouldn\'t call him rude.\r\nMy room was on the 39th floor, 2 Queen Sized beds. The elevator was a little slow for me since I was on one of the top floors. Someone has to stay on those floors, though-right? \r\nMy room was impecably clean. The bath products were Bath & Body Works. There were 4 fluffy towels in my room. There was also a coffee maker which I didn\'t use.\r\nLarge flat screen LCD TV was great, got most channels I wanted except no Food Network or Comedy Central. Oh well, not there to watch TV but they are basic cable channels so I was disappointed. \r\nThe view was of Times Square and I didn\'t even shut the black out curtains at night. The view was great and the lights did not bother me at all.\r\nThe bed was comfortable, the pillows were a little bit mushy for my taste, but workable. There was an i-Pod docking station/alarm clock which I thought was a nice touch.\r\nThe internet was WIRED and cost $16.95/day-at least it should have been wireless at that price! What a rip-off. And it goes noon to noon not 24 hours from when you purchase. I was NOT impressed with that. I like to sit on my bed and do work when I travel as many others do, but that wasn\'t possible with wired access. I was able to pull it close enough to put my feet up on a bed but that was it. The connection speed was mediocre at best. Again for the price it should have been much better. So that was a little disappointing.\r\nThe AC was fine, I like the room pretty cool so it was hard for me to tell if the AC wasn\'t working well or it was me. The room was around 67 the whole time, I would have preferred 65.\r\nWith my TV on I couldn\'t hear anyone else in surrounding rooms. \r\nThere is a Starbucks on the 8th and 1st floors of this hotel as well as numerous restaurants. For $10 I was able to eat a decent Starbucks breakfast each day of my stay as compared to the hotel restaraunt buffet at $28pp plus tax and gratuity. (Welcome to New York my friends!) The cheapest thing on the a la carte breakfast menu was a $10 fruit cup! So Starbucks it is! The room service menu was as expensive as can be expected, but you are in NYC, in an expensive hotel and in the middle of Times Square. There is however a shop on the 8th floor of the hotel, honestly the prices were much more reasonable than I expected in the shop. Snacks, soft drinks and gift items. You can eat for less money in this area, but you really have to look for it. There is a deli on the corner of 49th/Broadway with great sandwiches-$10 for lunch...\r\nSo all in all the room was clean, I slept well. I don\'t think I would have stayed here at the $400+ a night rate, but for $210 a night it was fine. Very upscale for foreign tourists and high-end business class. With my little ol\' government rate I didn\'t quite fit here, but that was ok. Very convenient to where I needed to be.'
3,'Great Location!','The best thing about this hotel is the location. It\'s right in the middle of Times Square, so the price was fitting, however the rooms were EXTREMELY tiny. In order to walk past the bed and the TV stand, we had to turn sideways and we\'re average sized people. The bathroom was about the size of my closet and I really disliked that there wasn\'t a fan for the bathroom to clear the steam from the shower. Other than that, it was very clean, the staff was very helpful and friendly and I really liked that there was security looking for your key card when you wanted to go up the elevator. Made me feel really safe.\r\nNo swimming pool. \r\nThe Rum House lounge is right off the lobby, which was also very neat. A man was playing the piano in a dark lit lounge.. felt very NYC.\r\nI would recommend this place to friends who are looking for somewhere to stay that\'s right in Times Square and doesn\'t cost too much.'
5,Fabulous,'My husband and I stayed for the July 4th weekend and we have a great stay, rooms were very clean, we stayed in a King room and thought the room was very big, it had sofa, chair and coffee table which was a nice surprise. One wall was all window so the view of the skyline was awesome. Elevators were fast never waited more than a couple of minutes everytime. Location was the best there is for Times Square. Check in and out was quick and simple, employees were all pleasant and helpful. Security at the elevators so you had to show your room key before you could get into the evelators which was nice.'
1,'disgustingly dirty','This hotel was misrepresented completely in the brochure. Walls, carpets, etc were dirty. Room badly needed painting. Curtains were too short to block out morning light. Bathtub needed reglazing. Walls were paper thin-heard everything going on in the next room (and their bathroom!) Disgusting hotel-would steer clear of it completely.'
3,'Good but not awesome...','We stayed for 5 nights at Crowne Plaza Times Square. The location is perfect for musicals and tourism in NYC. We had a king bed room with view in the angle of the hotel on 26th floor. The view was not terrific because of the (quite ugly) buildings all around that prevented us to see Hudson river properly and we had to turn head at the window to see Times Square. The room was clean and spacious, though a bit old fashioned. The bathroom was a bit old fashioned too. \r\nWe had stayed for 5 nights just before that in another hotel (a 3 star, less expensive) during the same trip, and I would say it was as good as this one. \r\nMy conclusion is that it\'s no use paying a supplement to get a king bed and a room with view in angle at Crowne Plaza, because the view is not worth. Probably the basic rooms are less disappointing?'
1,'Small, Smarmy Rooms and Poor Service--Never Again','I was coming into NYC on business, and my company has a corporate rate (20\% off lowest available rate) at the Morgan Hotel Group. The manager in our NY office suggested the Hudson, so I called to make a reservation. First, I was quoted a rate that was significantly ABOVE their lowest rate on their website. Huh? What happened to this great rate? I worked with the reservation agent (who, to the company\'s credit, was very personable and professional) and finally found an acceptable rate for a standard room. The agent also asked if I had any requests. I specifically asked for a QUIET room. He was happy to oblige.\r\nSo, I get to the hotel and there\'s no sign outside. I had to ask my driver several times if this was, indeed, a hotel. He chucked and said yes. I got out and was greeted by a guy in an overcoat. No uniform. I was thinking that this guy was maybe a bellman, maybe stealing my luggage. Whew. Bellman/Doorman. Okay.\r\nSo up the chartreuse escalator I go. I looked at my sickly green tinted hands (bad lighting) and had a bad feeling. I arrived at the impressive lobby--huge desk, indoor foliage...it looked like a park in the lobby. However, it was as dark as a park in the middle of the night. Small spotlights lit up the front desk personnel like eerie ghost-receptionists. I walked up to the desk and was greeted warmly. I then went through the check-in process and was duly informed that they would be charging $200 on my card as security for incidentals. Um, what? I was assured that if I didn\'t go beyond my expected bill, that the charge would be refunded. Um, what? You\'re charging my card for an amount I haven\'t spent and may not spend? Okay...\r\nAnyway, I got my room key and went up to my room. I walked in to a very funky, tiny, wood-paneled room. I have stayed in NY hotels before, but this was small for even those standards. But okay, it was clean. Kind of tired and old, but clean. The desk? Totally Ikea, as was the rest of the decor. However, the issue was the noise. I was in a corner room on the 6th floor on a busy street. And the windows wouldn\'t close. This was about as far from quiet as one could get. I might as well have been sleeping on a balcony. I go down to the front desk, and they said that they would have to send engineering with a special key to close the windows. WhatHUH? Yes, people cannot shut a window by themselves at this hotel. You need an engineer.\r\nSo the engineer gets there. There is NO key. He has a hammer and a screwdriver and POUNDS the window shut. It was broken. But even shut, the noise is...well, pretty darn bad. So I call down to the front desk and state that I was specifically asked if I had a special request and stated that I wanted a quiet room. That\'s not guaranteed. Okay, so did you check if there was a room on the inside of the hotel? No. So they check, and voila, there is! Would they send up the key? NO. We\'re too busy. Sorry, you have to come down and get it.\r\nSo I do. And when I get down there, the front desk has NO idea what I\'m talking about and I have to explain all over again. And I\'m again admonished for NOT knowing that a request is not something that they really can fulfill. And even though they had a quiet room, it wasn\'t really something that they could fulfill??? Okay.\r\nSo up to the 2nd room I go. I walk in. It\'s smaller than the first one, if that\'s possible. Yes, it is. But it\'s so small that there is NOWHERE to put my clothes. No bureau. NO CLOSET. NO HANGERS. NO IRON or BOARD. \r\nNow I\'m angry. I call down and speak to a manager and give him HELL. WTF? No closet? In a hotel? What...do they rent this room by the hour??\r\nI relay my disgust, dismay and total fatigue. I had been traveling all day, hadn\'t eaten and was about at the end of my rope. So he upgrades me to a larger room AND sends up a key. And who delivers it? The gal that was too busy before. HA.\r\nSo I get to the next (and final) room. It\'s quite (on the garden side of the hotel). It has two double beds and a small sitting area. Apparently, this is a gargantuan suite in their minds. To me, it\'s about the size of a NORMAL hotel room anywhere, and smaller than most in NYC. But it\'s quite, it has a closet and a TV and a safe. Finally.\r\nSo, I\'m sure that others have had better experiences. I did not. I won\'t be back, Sabrina (Guest Relations Manager), so don\'t ask me to give you another chance. I won\'t. And I\'ll make sure that my company doesn\'t try to place other people in your service hell-hole and hobbit-sized rooms.'
4,'Love the Westin - Perfect Way to Experience NYC!','I organize a yearly girls\' NYC weekend trip centered around a Brodway show and after going through Hotel Planner and getting an awesome rate, our group of 30 made our reservations here. I have to say I wasn\'t flying blind - I have stayed at this location several times. The group sales staff was impeccable (Joann Casiano) and they took care of all of our requests. Not one of the group had any issues with the room or the stay in general. sooms are well appointed and the location can\'t be beat. If I had a complaint, it would only be the selection of dining in the hotel. There is only Shula\'s (a little pricey) and the bar, not much else. Notso big of a deal because you are right in Times Square and there are a million restaurants right out your door but ont he evenings when we didn\'t want to leave the hotel, we had limited options. Otherwise, it was a great trip and a great stay!'
2,'Extremely Dated Rooms and Atmosphere','I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for three days (two nights) earlier\r\nthis week. Having driven into the city from Rhode Island, I was pleased that the hotel was easy to find and that curbside valet parking was available and affordable.\r\nChecking in and getting to my room was simple. The staff behind the counter was extremely helpful, and there were certainly enough elevators to accommodate those coming and going.\r\nUpon entering the room though, I realized just how dated things were.\r\nThe bathroom featured antiquated fixtures and there was no counter or\r\nfloor space to speak of.\r\nThe room did feature a nice working space and kitchenette, but I questioned the cleanliness of the provided utensils, pots, pans, etc.\r\nFinally, the rugs were clearly weathered with light stains and the noise up seven levels was difficult to sleep through. Being downtown,\r\nit\'s tough to ever have peace and quiet.\r\nIn the end the stay was fair. For the price, I would not deem this to be a value, but it was fine for me because I knew of many others staying in the hotel as we were all there for the same off site functions.\r\nIf I had to do the trip again, I would opt for alternative accommodations.'
4,'Edison Hotel','Incredibly central hotel - about 1 minute walk from Times Square.\r\nVery close to everything - rooms ok, small bathroom.\r\nMaid service very friendly and everything you want close by.\r\nWould stay again if the Waldorf isn\'t in your budget!'
1,'Une honte','Attention à l\'arnaque!! Évitez à tout prix cet hôtel, pour 300$ la nuit nous avons eu une chambre très salle, minuscule, une salle de bain à faire fuir, insalubre. Le personnel est extrêmement mal aimable. Je me suis fait avoir, d\'abord aucun intérêt à loger dans ce quartier touristique, miux vaut aller dans downtown, vous aurez un bien meilleur hôtel pour ce prix là. Fuyez cet hôtel.'
4,'Great Location, Comfortable Room','We spent 7 nights starting Easter weekend and were quite satisfied with the Hilton. We were given a recently remodeled room on a high floor reserved for Hilton Honors members so that may have made a difference.\r\nThe hotel delivered on my most important requirements: it was quiet, the bed was comfortable, and the location is great. The air conditioning system worked very well. On the downside, both the hotel reception level elevator lobbies and the number of elevators are woefully inadequate for the size of the hotel. At busy times every day it was not unusual for every elevator that stops at your floor to be crammed with people. We sometimes had to wait for the fourth or fifth elevator before there was one with room to board.\r\nThe satellite TV system was glitchy and might or might not be receiving the network you\'d like to see at any given moment. The bathroom was very small, especially compared to the relatively spacious room. It was clear at some point the tub had been removed and instead there was a shower big enough for four. I would have preferred more bathroom floor space to all that shower floor space.\r\nBut those were small problems offset by the very convenient subway stations (57th St. at 6th Ave. and Rockefeller Center), a short walk to Central Park, Times Square, many theaters, and 5th Avenue shopping. We never ate at the hotel so I can\'t comment on that.'
2,'Claustrophobic and Pitch Black - Just what you want for a Honeymoon!','The Hudson hotel in New York City is classed as a \'boutique\' hotel but with 15 floors and hundreds of hotel rooms all identical you can hardly class it as \'boutique\'. We stayed here because it was close to our wedding venue in Central Park. \r\nOn first arrival it is very hard to tell that it is the Hudson hotel with no visible markings or signs outside. Then you are greeted with huge glass doors which open the wrong way for pulling luggage through. Then the escalators and green glow of the paint and lighting which make it feel like you are entering a cinema or shopping centre.\r\nThe entire hotel lobby is cloaked in fake ivy making it incredibly dark, even in the midday sun. There are lots of little nooks and crannies and comfy chairs which always seemed to contain someone asleep in them (no suprise considering the consistent darkness!) The staff were very polite and helpful although my parents had to wait 4 hours for their room the be ready.\r\nThe biggest suprise and indeed dissapointment came when we got to our room. To say the room was shoe box like was an understatement. It consisted of a narrow corridor into the room with a hanging rail for clothes and then basically a bed, a small walkway around the bed with a desk at the end and then a glass wall which was the back of the shower! The bathroom was ridiculously small and it would be true to say that knees touched the wall whilst on the lavatory!. The shower consisted of a small tray and two curtains, one for the inside of the bathroom and one to cover the glass wall in the bedroom.\r\nThe whole hotel continued to be cloaked in darkness and whilst the bar lounge was a little more illuminated, the price for a bottle of corona or any beer left jaws on the floor. $18 for 2 drinks and then tip meant that each time $20 lighter in the wallet!\r\nThen there was the noise from the disco on Fridays and Saturdays. To say we were on the 11th floor the music and talking was crystal clear!\r\nSeems like I am complaining about most things but it was a very dissapointing experience for our wedding and honeymoon. The place was clean and tidy and the staff were polite and helpful and if you like living like a mole person in perpetual darkness then this is the place for you!\r\nIf you however like larger rooms, peace and quiet in the early hours and competitive bar prices, look elsewhere. Jolly Madison Hotel on 38th Street is highly recommended!'
3,'Does the job...price is right and so is location','Having to travel to NYC frequently over the next few months for my daughter\'s college theater department auditions, finding an inexpensive place to stay in Manhattan that doesn\'t break the bank account was a challenge. I learned about this place but was very leary after reading reviews that included bed bugs, etc.\r\nI took a chance because of the good reviews and was glad I did. \r\nFirst tip - I initially made my reservation through bookit.com - my go-to cheap travel website but upon checking the hotel website a few days prior - found that they offered a special $10 cheaper that included breakfast. - Let me clarify that breakfast is just juice/coffee/tea and one choice of a pastry - but still - included makes all the difference. I changed my reservation to the cheaper one easily.\r\nThe lobby was huge and really nice and includes a couple restaurants, souvenir shops and tvs with news channels on - and lots of couches to sit on if you arrive too early for check-in which we did. The bellboy lent us a door key so we could use the bathroom on premises. The people at check in were very nice and very helpful. \r\nOf course once heading up to our room on the 10th floor - you definitely can see the carpets need replaced but they were decent enough. Historic vault doors were cool on the rooms.\r\nThe room itself of course needed an update - worn carpeting and mushy bed. But I stripped down the sheets and didn\'t see any evidence of bed bugs (peppery matter) - and the shower - tho also could use some work - worked - and had plenty of towels, shampoo and soap.\r\nI did have a problem with getting the shower completely turned off and called to have the problem handled. Within 5 minutes someone was at our door and I appreciated that. They easily fixed the problem (the one shower spigot needed tightened, which can happen anywhere) and left in record time. Problems don\'t bother me - them not being handled does. In this case, it was quickly handled so no problem.\r\nTho I wish it felt a little cleaner - not well dusted around the edges and worn furniture, etc. - we were only there one night - so it completely did the job. The location can\'t be beat - right across from Madison Square Gardens and just a few blocks from times square and near a ton of shops and a mall - and the service was really great and within a block or two of several different subway stops.\r\nFYI - no internets in room - except for a fee - and they will store your luggage at $4 - but they can also include that in your room check-out invoice. \r\nAnother little touch included the subway map that comes with your key. I kept mine and it has been useful on subsequent visits.\r\nI will be staying there again for another college audition - and tho not my favorite - it completely did the job!'
3,'Noisy if a light sleeper, bring your ear plugs!','If you\'re a light sleeper, this isn\'t the place to stay. This is the only hotel at which I\'ve stayed where the doors slam loudly, no matter how they are closed. May seem like a minor nuisance, but it is extremely bothersome if you\'re trying to get some shut-eye. As it is a huge hotel, doors slam left and right as people go about their business. I think there are better hotels that are more relaxing. Otherwise, rooms are a decent size and so are bathrooms. There is no mini-bar though or refrigerator, so forget about storing any munchies. Pretty much a business-class hotel.'
4,'BEST LOCATION IF STAYING IN NYC, CLEAN AND FRESH','We decided to stay here because this was our first time in NYC. Wow!! what a location very close proximity to everything like right in Times SQ, 10min cab to Meat Packing District, you can walk to Central Park, Fifth Ave, Rockefeller place, 5 min subway ride to SOHO Little Italy..just a great place'
4,'Tiny rooms, but IKEA sensibility and Design Within Reach aesthetic make it work','If you\'re looking for a super-chic centrally-located NYC hotel experience, but you\'re on a tight budget, the Hudson is the way to go. You can get in next to Columbus Circle (southwest corner of Central Park) for just over $200 -- a steal in that neighborhood and for this kind of hotel.\r\nYou\'re greeted by one of the swankiest lobbies around, with a lounge decorated like the mystical outer space-time room at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. You can watch hipsters grind on the dance floor (we admit they were a sexy bunch), and the music is fun, but beware the drink tab -- two drinks cost $35 with tip (!).\r\nEven the elevator is cool -- we overheard three different groups commenting on how interesting the walls of the elevator were. (It\'s a cool metal pattern -- you\'ll have to visit to see what we mean.)\r\nThe rooms are clean, neat, and well-decorated, with comfy beds.\r\nSo how is this just over $200? Well, the rooms are tiny. Matchbox-sized. It brings Tokyo to mind. In our room there was barely enough space to walk around the bed, and the shower was a standup right next to the toilet and sink. But they make it work -- everything fits just so, with clever shelving and furniture configured so there\'s just enough room to shower, sit at the desk, move around the bed, and put your luggage down. So after you get over the initial wow, this is tiny shock, you\'ll be impressed at how well it works.\r\nTake it for a spin -- great for date trips, outings with friends, and for entertaining your favorite Euro-guest.'
4,'Gran hotel, muy bien situado y con buen servicio que nos mantuvo bien atendidos durante huracán Sandy','Elegimos el hotel por su magnifica situación, a metros de Grand Station, en una zona de muchos restaurantes y a 10. Min times square, 15 central park... Con un lobby espectacular y un servicio detallista recomiendo sus desayunos y buen café. Muy bien atendidos durante huracán Sandy'
5,'Excellent Hotel in a perfect location in Manhattan','I was in New York from the 3rd to the 10th of February and stayed in the Affinia Manhattan for the duration. \r\nThe hotel was excellent and well worth all the good reviews it has received on here. \r\nFrom the moment we arrived the staff were exceptionally courteous and friendly and done everything they could to improve our stay there. \r\nThe rooms themselves are extremely spacious, I stayed in a one bedroom suite which was as big as nearly three or four hotel rooms put together in Ireland!! My friend was staying in one of the studios which was also very spacious. The furniture was extremely comfortable and suited the room, although the kitchen was a little dated. The beds were extremely comfortable and even had a pillow menu! \r\nI would definitely stay here again because of its great location (opposite madison square garden), excellent value for money and great staff.'
5,'Great hotel in an ideal location','I booked the Westin new York times square as an early treat for a big birthday so I was hoping for something special! I most definately got what I was hoping for. The westin is a great hotel with lovely rooms (we were in 35th floor corner room), pleasant staff and a perfect location. I had e-mailed the hotel prior to our arrival and had spoken a lovely lady called \'Jessie.\' she had very kindly arranged the corner room for us with amazing views of the empire state building and the most comfy bed you could ever imagine!! We were delayed on the way out but the hotel still had a bottle of champagne & a birthday cake left in the room for us on the evening of arrival. The hotel is on the doorstep to so many great places like Madame Tussauds, B B kings & times square area. We sought advice on the st Patrick\'s day parade and the concierge was more than happy to help and provide a complimentary map for us. The little touches really do make a difference and the westin had plenty. All in all we.had a fantastic time and would not hesitate to stay in the westin again! Don\'t go looking for a highly personal service as you are one of hundreds of guests staying there but they provide a highly efficient service in a fantastic location. A great base for exploring, dining & enjoying the sights & sounds of new York! P.s the windows are all sound proofed so the only sounds you hear are when you step outside!!!! Enjoy'
4,Quirky!,'Spent 4 nights at the Hudson - recommended by our travel agent. Arrived late evening - I suppose our taxi driver knew it well as it had no indication from the roadside that it was the Hudson. Lobby and reception is at the end of a fluorescent green escalator from the roadside. Lobby and reception were dark and moody with lots of dark wood everywhere. Dark corridor lead to the library bar and access to courtyard garden/seating area (outside). Checked in in about 3 minutes. Room on the 4th floor. What strikes you first is the size of the room - quite small by comparison with other US cities. A white net curtain was drawn between the entrance area and bed area. More dark wood panelling, dark wooden floor. Interesting bathroom. Very small but functional. A large glass partition between shower and bed area could lead for interesting views but the shower curtain and net curtain mask any views you might have. Be careful sitting down on the toilet not to bang your head on the wall 3 inches infront of you! Comfortable bed, but air con noisy at times (but not excessively). Bedside lamps can be swivelled to show a white or a green light - nice. Flat screen TV, CD/radio and ipod docking station all available in room. No mini bar, but outside the elevator doors were vending machines for food, drinks (soft) and ice, all cheaper than traditional minibar prices.\r\nBreakfast can be taken in a large room just off the lobby that looks as if it was out of the last scenes of the movie 2001. Breakfast was expensive - we ate in one of 2 cafes 50 yards either side of the front entrance.\r\nOutside - turn right, is a shopping mall, then Columbus circle, and beyond that - Central Park.\r\nAbout a 15 minute walk to Times Square and the theatres. We saw Rock of Ages - 1980\'s rock music - very good, very funny - well worth a look.\r\nHad reservations for The View - revolving restaurant overlooking Times Square - beautiful food, attentive waiter, water $10 a bottle!\r\nAlso had tickets for the Top of the Rock - Rockerfeller Centre. Similar to top of the Empire State - excellent views of Central Park, not so good of the Chrysler Building.\r\nAlso visited Liberty Island. Be prepared for airport style security checks before you get on the ferry. No tickets for the crown of the statue - sold out till January we heard.\r\nUse the subways to get about - buy a Metrocard ticket from the machine in the subway - $8 for 4 rides, or share it between a couple. Fast, efficient, clean - no worries at all.\r\nWalked our legs off - blisters, but wonderful city to visit.'
3,'Good and not so good','My husband and two grown children stayed here in two rooms for four nights. We booked two rooms through a booking agency months before and requested and paid for two double/queen rooms. We arrived and had two twin rooms. The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. Small, but this is NYC. I asked about paying for the larger rooms and was told that if the hotel did not have availability, they could substitute rooms. My daughter and I were on the fourth floor for the first night. We could not sleep very well because the hot water heating system of the hotel was clanging an banging all night long. In the morning, I requested to move and again mentioned the double/queen reservation we paid for. We were told we could move to another twin room if we moved right away as there were no double/queen rooms available- I had to go wake up my daughter to move. The second twin room was on the tenth floor and was perfectly fine. Very clean with comfortable beds. My husband and son were on the ninth floor and were fine with their room. We found the hotel staff to be friendly and liked that the doormen were diligent with checking for room keys to get on the elevator. Please check out Danny\'s Deli next door. Very inexpensive and good breakfasts and deli sandwiches. We ate there almost every day. My only complaint was that the hotel did not honor our reservation. I do have to say that the company called the hotel after our move to the higher floor and discussed the issue and told us to check back with the desk. By this time, I had talked to the people at the desk twice about the situation and we were comfortably settled in our twin rooms. So, we decided to stay put. I recommend the hotel if you can get on a higher floor away from the clanking pipes and if you want to be in Times Square. Not fancy, but comfortable, clean, and extremely convenient. Wish the hotel had Wifi that was reasonable in price.'
4,'Not bad at all!','I was a little leery booking this hotel because of the reviews but because we got such a fantastic rate and we wouldn\'t be spending very much time in the room we took it. I\'m glad that we did! The hotel itself is a little dated but I can say that it is very clean and neat. There was always an available elevator and the staff was very friendly and helpful and we were always greeted with a smile!\r\nI would definitely stay here again because of the staff and because of the location. We were in the middle of everything!'
4,'Spec\'s in The City','My Friend and I (we bothwear glasses LOL) stayed at The Edison for four nights. We were a lttle disappointed with our room (319,very tired and in need of a lick of paint ), and being on the 3rd floor we were disturbed through the night with a dripping tap in the bathroom, Traffic noise and Trash trucks at 3am. The next day we didnt make a fuss, we asked to be moved and the helpful reception staff moved us to the 14th Floor(1410), the room was fresher and the noise level was much better.\r\nThe location was amazing literally around the corner from Times square and a subway station..brilliant...\r\nThe staff at the Hotel are very friendly and helpful.\r\nThe hotel Diner was good too and their pancakes(huge)and coffe set us up for the day nicely.\r\nIf you want an ultra modern hotel that is clinical and looks like any hotel in any city then this one is not for you. \r\nWould go back to the Edison .'
5,'Top-Hotel in Top-Lage','Das Hotel liegt direkt neben dem Times Square. Von hier aus kommt man zu Fuß zum Central Park, 5th Avenue und Empire State Building. Das Corner - View Zimmer bietet eine tollen Ausblick aus dem 42. Stockwerk. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und vor kurzem renoviert. Der Stil ist sehr modern und elegant. Das extra Frühstücksbuffet ist ziemlich teuer.'
1,'dirty dirty dirty','stayed in this DUMP 5 nights \'that could be a record\' with friends16th-21st of march. i kid you not 4 hours in line to check in. thats after a 10 hour flight. i would safely say the staff never got a training day in their life, so rude and totally ignorant its beond words. finally got so called rooms on 3rd floor. i nearly fainted when i looked in. now i stayed in hotels all over the world and put up with all sorts but this place takes the biscuit. its filth every inch of it. i\'m sure any american who stayed here is very embarrest. it was my friends first visit to the usa and it was not pleasant to say the least. its to late to send in the leigons of cleaners thats required just tear it down. its not a hotel. i felt cleaner sitting on a bench in central park. as for the safety boxes thats a laugh too you will have a job getting your own money from them because the staff are get this \'to busy\'. please guys dont bring your wife or espically kids to this dump. i showered at a friends house in queens every second day. if you like filth and grime you\'ll fit right in other wise stay in a bin in central park its cleaner i mean that. i love new york city and will be back but not in this dump'
5,'Ottimo hotel, ottima location!','Hotel veramente bello! E\' una struttura molto grande situata accanto al Chrysler Building e a qualche minuto a piedi dalla Fifth Avenue e da Times Square. Nulla di più comodo per muoversi in centro a qualsiasi ora del giorno e della notte. La hall confina con uno degli ingressi della Grand Central Station quindi si ha l\'ingresso della subway sotto i piedi. Le camere sono grandi, pulite e dotate di ogni comfort. Lo staff è estremamente professionale e cordiale. All\'interno dell\'albergo c\'è un piccolo minimarket, caro ma comunque comodo. Sicuramente il soggiorno non è economico ma se potete spendere qualcosa in più non tergiversate, rimarrete sicuramente soddisfatti!'
4,'A nice place to stay','We stayed four nights at the Hudson and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location, yes the rooms are small but we were in NY to see the sights not spend great amount of time looking at the room. The only problem we had was that the bath kept backing up and what looked like soot made the bath look black. At first i thought it was me cause i had a long plane trip but the second time i knew i wasn\'t that dirty :) Overall nothing to complain about.'
4,'Great location!','The hotel is newly renovated and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The staff is very helpful and always willing to lend a hand. This hotel is located in one of the best locations in NYC, close to all major subways and many NYC landmarks.'
1,'Hated it!!','Very small rooms depressing feeling. The staff are so rude they make you feel terrible for even being there! The men that work there are busy staring at women and it\'s just an overall bad feeling I got when I was there. My mother stayed there in the 1940\'s and said it was a great hotel! Boy have things changed since then.'
4,'Busy busy','This is one of the busiest hotels ive been to. It feels more like a mini mall than a hotel. Right smack in the middle of Times square, u can\'t beat the location. There is starbucks downstairs and yer a step away from literally everything- there is a yummy bakery once u cross the street and the NY tour buses are just around the corner- Reception staff quite friendly and smartly offered us an upgrade to get a better view of the city which we took (not complimentary). Rooms are comfortably sized. Bathrooms have basic amenities. There is no wifi (which is a bummer). TV channels are ok. There is NO water heater but a coffee maker ? No complimentary water and No mini bar. Checkout process pretty fast. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and anyway who\'s got time to stay in a hotel in NYC ??'
5,'Meets expectations with a nice touch','For half the price of the hotel my colleagues stayed at, I was very pleasantly surprised with the Edison. Walking into the hotel, it feels like you\'re stepping back into the 60\'s, except where you want the comforts of the 21st century. I\'m a huge fan of art deco, and the Edison certainly delivered my favorite architecture. \r\nStepping off the elevator into the hallway was quite intimidating as the hallway does not look very nice. Once you open the door, however, the room is snug, comfortable, and seemingly built especially for the flat-screen tv mounted on the wall. The doors were original which added a nice touch, but the bathroom had been completely updated. I was prepared for a very budget feel with it being an off-brand budget hotel, but checked-out very happy.\r\nWhen you stay at Times Square, you don\'t plan on staying in your room much. Surprisingly for the price and location, you could still do just that at the Edison. I will return given the opportunity'
5,'Awesome location - fantastic hotel','As first time travelers to New York City I researched hotels extensively as I had heard that the rooms are very small in New York City. We decided to spend a little more than our budgeted accommodation rate for the trip to ensure that the room we got was ok as we were traveling with two children (8 year old and 1 year old) and seven pieces of luggage. So we did spend more however our room was dare I say too big. Our room was the luxury suite king bed. supplied at not extra charge was a rollaway bed and baby cot. It contained one bathroom located off the bedroom, one bedroom with a flat screen TV, a separate living area with another flat screen TV, another bathroom (toilet only), 8 seater dinning room table and a small kitchenette. Gym was an awesome facility (for those of you who use the gyms while on holidays), the bar at the lobby was great with fantastic service. Location was brilliant and although a bit tiring being in the middle of the tourist trap was really central to all areas. Loved it Loved it Loved it!\r\nOnly complaint I would have is the rooms were loud and we could hear a lot of other guests coming and going and our complimentary turn down service did not happen two of the seven nights we were there.'
1,'Great Location , Bad Rooms','I like so many others stayed and I read the reviews. But I really like the Location. The Desk guy was very helpful but hte room was run down , I had a roach in the shower that was so big, I could have rode it down 7th Ave! , No Heat in the room , No towels, & when I asked the maid the next morning for some she acted like I was stealing them! No hot water, and I was just a poor excuse of a Hotel.....and this place was busy!! they will not fix this problem if people continue to book this place! I stood out side and watched the doorman only take cabs that would had him money!! Only in NY.. you gotta love it'
4,'You aren\'t busy enough in NYC if you hear the noise!','Have stayed several places in NYC. The Affinia is in a great location beside Madison Square Garden, Penn Station Empire State Building and shopping! Noisy yes...firestation nearby, taxis, transports but the beds plus choice of pillow are wonderful. The view from the windows is so.....NY.....worth the noise. Never heard a thing as we were so tired from Broadway shows, walking all over the city that we slept soundly. Earplugs might be a help for some. You are in the middle of a very busy city!!!!! The kitchen was well equipped. We requested 2 bathrooms and a view of MSG which were both accomodated. Bathrooms are small but well equipped.....Noone has time for a long bubble bath anyway..... The rooms are large. We had a 1 bedroom deluxe suite. The rooms may not be as luxurious as home but we felt very safe and intend to return. Would be nice if internet was less expensive.'
4,'Great location, standard Hilton experience','The New York Hilton is situated in the center of Manhatten, just blocks from Radio City, the theater district and Central Park. Rooms are decent sized with a sitting sofa, comfortable beds and clean. Prices are high, but comparable to other NY hotels. Specials are available from time to time that lower the cost. I got a deal that included a $39 breakfast. It was very mediocre, however, so I was happy I didn\'t pay for it. Elevators can get backed up at busy times. But overall up to Hilton\'s high standards.'
4,'Spitzenhotel in Spitzenlage','Habe das Hotel für einen 10-tägigen Städtetrip zu einem Discount Preis erhalten. Der Check-In verlief sehr zügig - das Personal war sehr Freundlich. Wir bekamen ein kostenloses Upgrade auf ein größeres Zimmer, welches für ein Stadthotel ausreichen war. Man hält sich sowieso kaum in dem Zimmer auf, da die Stadt viel zu viel bietet. Das Zimmer war sauber und das Bad ausreichend Groß und auch sehr sauber. Standardausstattung der Zimmer - normaler Durchschnitt. Besonderes Bonbon ist die Lage des Hotels: direkt neben der Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. Vom Airport JFK ohne Umsteigen mit der Metro zu erreichen. 15 Gehminuten vom Times Square entfernt. Das Hotel an sich ist zwar etwas in die Jahre gekommen aber der Service stimmt. Das im Hotel integrierte Diner ist allerdings etwas zu teuer (aber lecker). Da gibt es nur wenige Minuten vom Hotel entfernt deutlich bessere Lösungen.'
4,'Huge Rooms for NYC','I couldn\'t believe the size of my room and the bathroom for a NYC hotel. There were much larger than what I expected. The free Wi-Fi is limited to something like 500 kbps, but it worked for me (a higher bandwidth connection is available for a fee). Room was clean and had a HUGE closet. Even though the hotel was recently updated, the hallways did look a bit worn. Still, for a comparable hotel in NYC, it was a good value.'
2,'Walls as thin as paper','Maybe it was just my room, but I could hear people in the hall and those next door as if they were in the room. Every time the elevator came and went, I knew it. Every time the people next door were talking with each other, it was as if they were talking to me.'
1,'The worst place I\'ve ever stayed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.','This room was absolutely disgusting. The bathroom was brown from rust, wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the room smelled of damp, and there was a draft from the window that would we could not rid of. My friend was ill on the first night, and unfortunately was sick in one of the bins. The cleaner did not clean this away until four days later, despite us leaving it in the middle of the room so it was blatently obvious. \r\nAs well as this, the \'double beds\' were tiny with DIRTY SHEETS! The location was the only good thing about this hotel. It was old, dirty and falling apart. I do not reccomend this hotel to anyone, regardless of your budget.'
2,'Nice lobby and concept but TERRIBLE service','I stayed at this hotel for business reasons but definately I would never go back; I rather look for something near by.\r\nI hate saying only the bad things so I would start sharing the good ones... nice concept, the lobby is really nice, young and nice people around, beatiful garden and roof top.\r\nBut service is really bad, they don\'t care about customers, it is a big hotel so exect that, besides there is a bar on the top of the bulding so be ready to be ID everyday on the wait back to your room and make a line for that... room service doesn\'t work all day long, only for breakfast and dinner... the halls are really dark, food average, unfriendly personnel, noisy at night, rooms are extremely small ... I bet you can get a better deal somewhere else'
5,'Great Hotel, Central Location, Good Value','Very pleased with this hotel. Our first trip to new york and we were delighted with the location which is very central and in a nice area. Service was good, rates were reasonable and room was good - clean, decent decor and well maintained while we were there. The hotel has a decent free gymn, bar and restaurant (which are fairly expensive, but lots of other places nearby).\r\nThere is a subway stop right by the hotel, and it is a 5 min walk to broadway/fifth avenue and only a few hundred yeards to central park. Based on our stay I recommend park central highly etc.'
5,'Couldn\'t have picked a better hotel in New York for the money','It would be hard to imagine the New York experience getting much better than this. Rooms are massive, foyer is grand, terrific hotel all round.\r\nGreat shoe shine out the front and a couple of blocks from the centre of NYC or the UN, Empire State and any number of other attractions. Walk to everywhere in NYC from here, and on top of Grand Central Station to boot.\r\nTerrific, email for details if required.'
4,'Mitten im Big Apple','Das Hotel liegt eine Strasse neben Times Square.\r\nIn wenigen Minuten erreicht man zu Fuss die 5th Avenue, das Rockfeller Center, Central Park das Empire State Building, die meisten Theater, eine Menge Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants.\r\nServicequalität scheint an der Frontdesk ein fremdes Konzept zu sein. Check-in wurde zumindest schnell gemacht und wir konnten zu unserem Club-Zimmer in der 12. Etage.\r\nSchade, dass sich diese exklusive Zimmer nicht in den höheren Etagen befinden. Das Zimmer war angenehm gross und mit einem Apple-Computer ausgestattet. Die Schallisolierung war gut. Die Sitzecke am Fenster ist eine gute Idee.\r\nFrühstück und Zwischenmahlzeit waren inbegriffen und in einer reservierten Lounge serviert. Beide waren lecker und jeden Tag wurden neue Produkte angeboten. Das Personal in der Lounge war nett.\r\nIm Ganzen war es ein angenehmer Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel.'
3,'HOTEL MUY ANTIGUO','Su ubicación fenomenal, pero las habitaciones necesitan una reforma urgente, el peronal un poco más de amabilidad, de todas formas puede ser una opción por la relación calidad/precio.\r\nLa información que ofrece en sus paginas no es la real cuando llegas al hotel, volveria a ir por precio ya que para dormir es pasable.'
4,'Amazing Times Square Location!!','My husband and I stayed here in June 2005 for 3 days. He was there on business and I tagged along for pleasure. This hotel is amazing with great staff! We had a lovily room and the front desk was happy to help us with maps and directions. Over the weekend they closed the street in times square and had a festival of sorts. Lots of food and booths. It was fun! Ok girls...you MUST visit the HUGE Sephora store right across the street. Fantastic! We did a TON of walking from our hotel up to 5th avenue and central park...down to empire state building. I think in those 3 days we had to have walked 300 blocks total. We also ventured on the subway too and took it to the WTC memorial site. I would definately stay here again as it was a great hotel in a fab location!'
5,'Excellent Experience... Great Hotel','Well, not sure why many people rated this hotel low. It\'s Terrific and so amazing!!!\r\nHowever I agree it\'s a little different.\r\nWhen we arrived we noticed that the restaurant became a night place and got scared to hear that loud music in our room and our baby could not sleep but when we got into the elevator and the floor we cold be sure that it wont affect our night sleep.\r\nWe spent 1 week on this hotel and we totally recommend it.\r\nWhen people say it\'s a little dark, it\'s true, I mean the aisles are dark but the room clear and comfortable, also room was clean enough and staff so nice\r\nExcellent Location, several services around (market, subway, drugstore, restaurants, Central Park, etc)\r\n100\% recommended\r\nThanks to Jerry Mac and Daniel for all the help during our stay\r\nRegards,\r\nMaurício'
4,'Best hotel for the price','I had to stay 3 extra nights in New York due to an extended business trip and decided to stay at The Crowne Plaza as it had a good location and the price was right. I have been used to New York prices as I have been coming to New York for the past three years on business so when I booked the hotel I was expecting your basic hotel and WOW was I shocked!!!! The room was huge by New York standards and the staff was very friendly. Check-in was quick and easy but most of all this hotel has a pool in the fitness center. You do have to pay for the use of the gym which I thought should be free but once you get in it is well worth it. If someone is looking for a great hotel that is in a good location and easy and comfortable I would say stay at the Crowne Plaza you can\'t go wrong!!!'
1,'Horror in Manhattan','The first room (I think 749 or 739) was definitely NOT what I reserved and paid for. I have two e-mails from Annette Narine sent earlier this year comfirming I booked and paid for a suite...you will have a king bed with a living room that comes with a pull out bed. Her words. What I got was a single room with two double beds. Additionally, the rug was dirty, the TV did not work, the curtain was wrinkled, the light was out by the closet, there were no additional blankets, the shower curtain rod was sagging, the shower curtain was cut, the shower head was loose and sprayed the bathroom, and the hair drier would cut out after only a few minutes. When I called the front desk to complain I was told by the female attendant that what we had was what we reserved and that the next upgrade would cost me an additional $800.00 per day. The next day (Monday) my wife went down to speak with a manager and was told there wasnt one available!!!! However, one of the staff (I think her name started with a N) listened patiently to our problems and had us moved to room 2240. OK this was better but it still wasn\'t what I reserved and confirmed by Ms Narine YOUR reservations clerk. Additionally, the TV did not work, the alarm clock did not work, the safe was in a locked position and the curtains in the room were wrinkled. After these problems were ironed out (excepting the ratty curtains) I notice that the heater would not worked. I was told that according to hotel policy it would not be available until it was 42 degrees outside. Mind you the first days we were in Manhattan it was cold and rainy. Not 42 degrees but cold and we couldn\'t get any heat. Also, WiFi was available only in the lobby for $14.00 per day.\r\nI feel I was cheated by your hotel. I did not receive what I was promised and I paid more for what I got. I feel a fraud was perpetrated.'
4,'Great location, big room, good hotel but don\'t expect great service','This hotel is in a great location - very central to Times Square, but also central to the subway to get everywhere else.\r\nRooms are large by NY standards, and well furnished.\r\nIt is a big hotel - so don\'t expect any personal service - the staff are very thinly stretched and not really available. Twice during my 5 day stay my room wasn\'t cleaned when I returned at the end of the day.\r\nOverall the location and room outweighed the bad service and I would stay there again.'
1,'What a shame on location','yes the hotel is very well located, but the room is really falling apart, ceilings have humidity, A/C doesnt have any buttons to activate it, TV is as old as my grandmas television, the look from the elevator is like the Twilight zone or haunted mansion game in Disney, the painting on walls is scratching, the room smells like wet dog!!!\r\nReally a very bad experience and paying more than a hundred dollars for this kind of room is awfull. My sister was bitten by some bug in the back!!! \r\nBelieve me is very very bad!!'
3,'Nice hotel, but there are better','My husband and I stayed for 3 days in September. The hotel is historic and the lobby is spectacular. Like many of the other reviews say, it gets very busy...lines for the front desk, breakfast, concierge, and it takes forever to get anyone on the phone. The rooms, though renovated, can be small and the walls are thin. I recommend asking for a room away from the train and on the outside. We were given complimentary breakfast vouchers, which were nice, but the breakfast wouldn\'t be worth paying full price. There is a nice Corner Bakery, right next to the hotel that has great food at half the price. \r\nWe choose this hotel because of the location, downtown and right on the train line, but the noise is loud and there are no great views of the city. We also tried the Balance spa and fitness center. The fitness facilities are great and the pool is nice. The spa is hard to find and a bit disappointing. They do not have a lounge/ relaxation room, sauna, and the whirlpool is by the pool on another floor. After my treatment, I felt rushed and didn’t get to relax with a nice cup of tea. They offer deals through Yelp and Groupon, so check before you book.'
3,'more a 3.5','I\'ve stayed at this hotel a few times, and the previous rooms would have merited a 4.0 rating. This time I can give it only a 3. First of all, the check in is quick and the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. My daughter joined us at the last minute, and she graciously found us a room with 2 beds instead of one. I also asked her for a quieter room - and she told me although it faced 7th Ave, the normally quieter rooms facing the side streets had construction noise early in the morning. So that was very helpful of her. The key to this location for us was the convenience (across from the Vamoose bus stop, Penn Station, and less than 15 walking distance to Jacob Javits Center, where we had a business conference) and the price (not cheap but less expensive than other NYC hotels in the area).\r\nThe room was much smaller this stay, with cracked ceilings, yellowed grout in the bathroom, and a single small window. The lobby looked less polished and the elevators more worn, but the rooms themselves have been renovated (definitely more modern looking than before). The beds were ok comfort-wise, and they have a pillow menu, which I always appreciate with my bad neck. Housekeeping was very good - I asked for extra toiletries for my daughter, and when my A/C was not working, one of the housekeepers tried to fix it herself, then called maintenance from my room. The gentleman repaired it promptly and was professional. I would stay here again - but ask for an upgrade or bigger room if available.'
4,'Fantastic Stay!','Our stay at the Palmer House Hilton Chicago was first class right from check in to check out. We purchased the room through Priceline and got an amazing deal. We paid $105.00 per night. After my purchase on Priceline and I learned that we got the Palmer House, I immediately called the hotel directly to make my special requests. I wanted a non-smoking, king room and an early check in. After reading some of the other reviews about Priceline I was a bit worried, because when I booked it I didn’t release that you basically get whatever is available and may not have your requests fulfilled. When I called the Palmer House they took down my requests and told me that they would do what they could to ensure that we received what we asked for.\r\nWe arrived at the Palmer House at about 1 p.m. and there was a bit of a line, but since there was 5 people working behind the desk we were checked in and up into our room in about 30 min. total. It was an excellent, fast check in from a very friendly clerk and we did receive what we asked for. Something else that impressed us was the fact that we didn\'t get charged extra for the early check in. \r\nWhen we got up into our room we were relieved because the room was clean, and decorated very nice. The room and bathroom was small, but for the two of us it was perfect. Having said that, would I have been disappointed had I had to pay full price for the room – yes I most likely would have been a bit pickier, but since I got the room for basically a steal, I was extremely satisfied. \r\nThe bathroom was very small and a couple of the tiles were falling off, the TV wasn’t a flat screen, there was no microwave or fridge, but I just ignored it and focused in on all the good. To name a few positives, the subway (red line) was right outside the door, friendly staff, extremely comfortable bed, nicely decorated hotel and room, walking distance to the Navy Pier – which I might add was a fantastic place as well. There were also many restaurants, shopping and a 7 eleven only steps away from the hotel. \r\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chicago. We both felt comfortable and relaxed with our whole stay at the Palmer House Hilton.'
1,'Pay for Standard w/2 beds - Get a twin in a hole in the wall','I booked a Standard room with two double beds for 5 nights with the average price being $389.00 per night. I was charged an average of $473.00 per night when the receipt came. Never received a response from Hotels.com regarding the higher rate.\r\nWhen arriving, was told that there was no reservation. The front desk was rude and had to argue with them for an hour and then finally received a room. The room that was given was one with a twin bed in a VERY (hole in the wall) small room. Complained at the front desk and they said that is all they had and that is what was paid for - offered nothing else and wouldn\'t discuss it any further even after presenting my printed receipt with the room accommodations that was paid for. That is all I asked for - was to have the room that was paid for!\r\nCalled Hotels.com and was put on eternal hold. Called a different number, asked to hold for 3 to 5 minutes at the most while they called the hotel - they never came back on the line. Tried this 4 times. Called Hotels.com again and needless to say even when asking to NOT be put on hold at Hotels.com - they just do and never come back on the line.\r\nTalked with the front desk again and was informed that that they only give rooms for that amount of people checking in - one person, one bed and it did not matter - period. Edison Hotel was given 5 opportunities to make things right and they refused and were RUDE, RUDE, RUDE! Was told that the reserved room was $205.00 a night, that is what they were paid and that is what I was getting. Was then told to contact the agency that made the reservation. \r\nMade a reservation and checked in at the New York Marriott Marquis around the corner, packed and started the check out process at the Edison Hotel. Requested 3 times for a receipt during the check out, was ignored and then the front desk refused to give one.\r\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND either the hotel or Hotels.com - it is a SCAM!\r\nI WILL TELL EVERY ONE I KNOW and NOT TO USE EITHER THE HOTEL OR HOTELS.COM. I book tens of thousands of dollars in travel and meetings a year.'
5,'Great time, great location!','We got a last minute deal at the Crowne Plaza which made it very worthwhile. (We had put in our names for a 4 star hotel, hotel unknown until booking. I\'m glad we took the gamble as we saved a ton of money which is not easy to do in NYC.\r\nI\'ve been to Time Square a bunch of times and never really noticed this hotel. Very very convenient to Time Square, it\'s also easy to get to if you\'re arriving by car located a short distance from the Henry Hudson Parkway. Take the 50th street exit.\r\nEven though we got a budget rate for our hotel room, we were given a room on the 40th floor offering awe-inspiring vistas to the Southwest. Oh, and the room was tastefully decorated, keeping with the 4 star rating for this hotel. And of course, it was very quiet, which was an added bonus.\r\nIf I have one complaint, and it\'s a minor one, it\'s the elevators. If you\'re staying on one of the upper floors, allow yourself a little extra time to get down to the lobby. This is a large place with lots of people coming and going all night. \r\nIf you\'re flexible with your travel dates and arrangements, you can score a great deal at this hotel. I hope to stay here again in the not-too-distant future!'
1,'Discusting Hotel Room','Probably the dirtiest hotel room I have ever stayed in in my entire life. There was a path of dirt from the door to the bathroom. It looked as if it hadn\'t been vacumed in a month. I could not bring myself to take a shower because of the massive clumps of long black hair in the bathtub. When it came time for bed I slept in my clothes, one top of the blankets, on top of the rest of the clothes in my suitcase. I took pictures of the hair clumps.'
5,'Hector Isaza is THE best doorman ever!!','The hotel was nice with a friendly staff. But the doorman, Hector Isaza, was superb! Everytime I crossed his path, he was warm, friendly, and welcoming. He should train a few of his colleagues...their dispositions could use a little polishing. Keep smiling Hector. I hope to see you again soon! s'
3,'Buon rapporto qualità prezzo e posizione strategica','Poco prima di partire (avevo già prenotato) ho letto delle recensioni totalmente negative sull\'hotel e sono partita con un po\' di apprensione. Posso assicurare che la mia esperienza invece e\' stata positiva. Le stanze erano un po\' piccole ma confortevoli, la pulizia buona, il servizio non ha presentato problemi.Certamente se ci si aspetta il lusso non e\' l\'albergo da scegliere.Ma soprattutto e\' in una posizione strategica, a pochi passi da tutto! nonostante la vicinanza a Broadway le stanze sono sufficientemente silenziose. Rispetto ai prezzi di NY ha un buon rapporto q/p strilusa54'
3,'Not up to expectations','This was a big event for us as we had never been on holiday to the USA before. I had booked a package with Cunard including flights to Newark and a three day stay in the New York Hilton followed by a cruise home on the Queen Mary2 so we were really looking forward it.\r\nPerhaps it was our fault for not doing our homework but the Hilton was a real shock to the system. Instead of a nice quiet check-in area we arrived in a huge lobby crammed full of dozens of noisy people dragging bags around with long queues at the check-in. There appeared to be very few seats and several people were sitting on the floor eating take-away food, more like a station than a hotel foyer, but we persevered and eventually were directed to our room.\r\nI\'ll list the disappointments first: No tea/coffee facilities in the room. The fridge wasn\'t working. The restaurant was closed in the evening. Hardly any information in the room regarding hotel facilities. Although there were around 80 buttons on the tv hand control I couldn\'t get beyond the home screen that consisted of endless adverts for pay-to-watch movies. Room soundproofing wasn\'t brilliant. Prices in bar and for breakfast were pretty steep. No quiet residents\' area to escape the busy lobby.\r\nOn the plus side, the rooms were comfortable and the air conditioning was most welcome. Also it was nice to have free use of the room safe. The location of the hotel couldn\'t be improved on and the various staff that we spoke to were helpful, polite and courteous.\r\nFinally, as a foreigner I wondered what the bucket in my room was for. On day two I noticed a girl filling a bucket with ice from a machine in the corridor and taking it to her room. Please forgive my ignorance but I\'m still not sure why I would want a bucket of ice in my room. Perhaps it\'s because the fridges don\'t work....???'
5,'Ideal for business and/or pleasure','Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for the first time. Tom checked me in and gave me a room on the 43rd floor. He was very friendly and made me feel at home. Great location, within walking distance to most places. Had a slight problem when trying to book a limo with the concierge but then I guess it was because of Saturday. Bed was very comfortable and cozy, and I slept so well. Had no problem with noiseness on the street. Only wished that the staff at the breakfast table were more friendly.'
4,'good for the price , certainly not the worst','You get what you pay for & who goes to New York to stay in the hotel room all day ?\r\nThe location is Fantastic! Just across the street from Penn station and Madison Square gardens, 10 minutes walk to Time Square.\r\nThe room was a good size with a comfy bed & clean sheets.\r\nHouse keeping cleaned the room every day, fresh towels & hot water were readily available.\r\nAll the staff were friendly and made us feel welcome.\r\nThe hotel is without a doubt in need of a refurb but it was safe and clean I would definately stay here again.'
5,'Lovely lobby','This was a lovely old hotel, the gran dame! The ceiling in the lobby was magnificent. The Blueberry Hibiscus mojito was so good, I had one several times during our stay. \r\n Also, this is the place that invented the brownie and boy were they delicious! Definately recommend, centrally located and very nice.'
4,'Klein und fein','Das Hotel liegt zentral. Man erreicht spielend viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß. Die U-bahn Station ist auch gleich an der Ecke. Das Zimmer war klein, aber für uns völlig ausreichend. Es wirkte gepflegt und sauber. \r\nDas einzige Manko (welches wir leider in mehreren amerik. Städten feststellten) war die Klimaanlage im Zimmer. Unsere war zu laut. Man kann sie zwar ausstellen, dann wird es aber zum schlafen unerträglich warm. Obwohl wir unser Zimmer im 32. Stock hatten, brachte Fenster aufmachen auch nichts, da das Hotel an einer großen Straße liegt. Die Safes waren in einem extra Raum hinter der Rezeption. Man wurde immer von einem Mitarbeiter begleitet und es gab ein sicheres System. Der Safe war kostenlos.\r\nGenerell kann ich das Hotel nur empfehlen. Die Gegend war belebt und wir fühlten uns im und um das Hotel sehr wohl. Die Fahrstühle wurden überwacht und ab 20 Uhr musste man zur Kontrolle seine Hotelkarte vorzeigen, damit sich keine Fremden in die Hotelzimmer begeben.'

1,'Avoid This Hotel If You\'re a Larger Person','The Hudson Hotel rooms are smaller than any I\'ve ever seen, including those in Europe. (Management must be making a killing - I think they took each room during renovations and sliced them in two, but don\'t charge anywhere near half the rate.) The room is about 8 foot by 16 foot total. The bathroom is so tiny, they use toilets the same size as those used by pre-schools. I found it difficult to, ahem, get a bit of reading in, as the toilet was so tiny and close to the wall that my knees were touching the wall. If you\'re over 6 foot, you might not be physically capable of using the toilet. The shower stall is so small, you can barely turn around. And the bedroom is so small, it\'s hard to regulate the temperature and humidity in the room. (And the HVAC system they use has lousy controls.) The bed is one mattress, low to the ground. They desk chair is metal, the desk is tiny. And on the ninth floor, you can hear the boom boom of the music downstairs, with the windows closed. And then, at 3:00 a.m. a bunch of cars honking horns woke me up. They need better windows. Not a pleasant stay. Could use a sign out front too.'
1,'Stay away','Ww paid $300 usd per night for a room that doesn\'t look anything like the photos. Our bathroom was falling apart, the walls were crumbling and looked like there were water damage.\r\nWe were told all rooms are the same so there were there was no point in changing room. They make you wait until 3 pm to check in and if you want to check you bags, it was $4 each. Other places we stayed did not charge anything. Some desk clerks were very rude and argumentative. After one night we found a nicer place that was less, had wireless, breakfast and close to Time Square. Even if the location was great, I would not suggest you stay here until the whole places was renovated and the staff were retrained.'
2,'Bad Service','The hotel is great, but you must check in at 3pm. I arrived earlier and the lady at the check in refused to give me a room or even to ask them to clean my room before 3pm. She said to me you did not pay an extra day, so you have to wait and the room MIGHT be ready by 3pm. Anyway, too lousy a service for this kind of hotel. I could pay an extra day or they could give me an earlier room so that they would keep the client. It seems that they do not care. Do not recomend for families travelling with children and arriving earlier than check in hour.'
1,'Park central : nothing works and very rude staff','My husband and I stayed at the Park Central hotel for 7 nights : what a nightmare!!!\r\nNothings seems to work there.The shower didn\'t work and we could not take it out from its holder ,everythime we used the shower as there was a leak in the bath the bathroom floor became a swimming pool,we had 3 phones in the room none of them worked,the curtains were broken and very dirty,the iron was disgusting and wasn\'t possible to iron even a sock with that while the iron board was so dirty i refused to use it and iron on the little table instead,the lifts didn\'t work and when they did we had to wait ages for one of them.As soon as we arrived at the hotel they gave us a very small room facing a bricks wall while in our reservation we asked for a big room ( the type we paid for) and a room facing 7th avenue as the hotel gave us the chance to choose of course paying some extra money.We went back to the reception asking to change room with a copy of my reservation and their agreement ,the woman at the reception like all the rest of the staff could not give a toss and she sent us to the manager saying that anyway we had to have that room because they dind\'t have any other room available!!!We made the booking 4 months in advance!!!! The manager kindly changed the room which still didn\'t face the 7th avenue but was bigger .Another evening our electonic keys for the room didn\'t work we managed to call the reception from the corridor phone and they assuered us they would have sent someone ...we waited for half an hour and then we had to go downstairs, the security they told us the nobody ever told them we had a problem with our keys!!!!Last day we were ready to pack everything and go downstairs for the check out : our safe box didn\'t work we had to call for someone to come and open it : it took about 2 hours and so we arrived late for the check out for something that had nothing to do with us ,the manager wanted to charge us for checking out late!!!!!!On top of all of that last morning my partner could not have a shower as the water was coming out black and full of dirt , while we were on the lifts we heard other people complaining about the water or the lack of water at all and so we started to exchnave views about the hotel,we were 9 people in the lift and NO one was happy with the hotel staff or management. Everytime we asked information or for a taxi at the hotel ,the staff always answered in a rude manner most of the times without listening and carrying on reading or chatting with someone else.The treatment we received in this hotel is AWFUL .And please don\'t take the black taxi in front of the hotel,the hotel staff tries hard to make you take the black taxi instead of the yellow .The yellow taxis are cheaper MUCH cheaper only once we took a black taxi and we were litterally ripped off : 35 dollars instead of the usual 15 and the driver spent all the time trying to sell us tours and things and as soon as we said we were not interested his manners became very rude .I travelled a lot but I have never experienced such a lack of good manners and such a poor management and service.Please avoid this hotel if you can .'
3,'A grand historic hotel with average rooms','The lobby is grand, although almost completely taken over by the bar. There are few hotels in Chicago that can claim or display the kind of history that the Palmer House can. Once leaving the lobby, the rooms are not great. They are large, the room we had would be a Jr suite anywhere else, and included 2 bathrooms; however, the furniture included was inadequate, the layout made no sense, and the tiny tv was so far away from the bed it wasn\'t easy to view. The hotel is large, and it is difficult to avoid stairs. The entry doors are not automated, which makes the hotel difficult for anyone loaded with luggage or who has mobility issues.'
5,'Always a great experience at the Hilton','I love staying at the Hilton New York. Be warned that there is a fee for doing just about anything in the hotel, though the elevators are still free. Unless you are in the executive lounge you pay for internet, local & long distance calls, use of the gym/pool, etc. Try to get a refurbished room, but it really doesn\'t matter as all of the rooms are fairly nice. Hotel is in a good central location between the stores of 5th Ave and the lights of Times Square. You are within walking distance of many things in NYC including MoMA (which is free on Friday evenings).'
1,'To be avoided','My company placed me in this hotel and paid full price for a suite. Starting with the check-in with unfriendly staff, to the rooms, which although, adequately appointed, had no luxury amenities, the feeling was one of me having to keep the staff happy. I had to use the paper cups from the coffee machine to drink water in the bathroom. The bathroom was appointed to about the same standard as a Days Inn motel. Although my company had negotiated extras like laundry, internet etc, these were only given to me at extra cost. At Check out, when I asked for the reservation hard copy, it was clearly written in the contract. The manager had nothing to say, not even an apology. A day after having checked out, my company Visa Card was debited without any following information and without my consent. My company has since black-listed this hotel. There are other nice hotels in this area which are great to stay in like the Intercontinental.'
4,'location is everything and hotel is very nice','This Marriott was very nice and similar to what you expect from all U.S. full service Marriotts. Check in was easy (the line was a little long but it moved quickly) and the room was nice. We are gold which usually gets us a room upgrade to the concierge floor but I did have to ask for it, which was a little disappointing. They were quite busy at check in so we didn\'t get the usual cheerful greeting given especially to gold/platinum members. We did happen to meet the front desk manager (Kizuwanda) and she was very friendly and helpful. She made us feel like we were special and like we were visiting old friends. Thanks for the great greeting and hospitality from the manager. We enjoyed our room which was nice and meet our expectations. The overall hotel setup was very nice and exciting. Entering the hotel from the street level was interesting in how the elevators work, but we were quickly oriented to the elevators by the attendant. Tip: don\'t just jump into an elevator like you are used to doing in most hotels - be sure to read the instructions listed or ask for help to get to the lobby then you will need to enter the floor you want to go on on of the elevator displays and it will tell you which elevator to go to...it\'s pretty cool how this works to manage such a large hotel and so many guests. It\'s an easy and efficient process. The elevators are a little slow sometimes but not too bad because there are so many of them but as I mentioned each elevator gets assigned based on floors selected, etc... The gym was very nice and modern with great equipment and an attendant which requests you to sign in even though you use your key to get into the gym. I guess this is how they manage so many people... The executive lounge is small given so many people using the lounge. We were lucky to get there for breakfast early and get a seat and not have to wait in line for food, however, sometimes the breakfast line was very very long and must have taken some people about 30 min. to even get breakfast. They definitely could use an additional lounge. The concierge and attendants in the lounge were very friendly and helpful. The food was typical and decent in the lounge which we appreciated - fresh cut up fruit, fresh muffins, etc... The evening snacks arrived a little late and there were many people waiting for the cookies to come, so i think that could have been managed better. They were fresh and good, though when they finally arrived. Not much of a variety for snacks or finger foods.\r\nThe location of the hotel was excellent given that it is right in the heart of Times Square! I can\'t say enough about the location - it was the best part of the stay especially since the hotel also was massive and made us feel special as if we were in a very spectacular venue. Seemed like lots of things going on in the hotel - shops, restaurants, etc... good people watching. \r\nOh, the top floor revolving restaurant has a great view of New York! It wasn\'t very inviting though unless you had a reservation or was ready to make a reservation as soon as you got off the elevator. You were stopped at the entrance of the restaurant, but, I would have liked to at least have a chance to check out the view as I decided whether or not I wanted to get a drink or eat. I think there was a minimum drink to just sit and take in the view. They could at least offer a few seats for viewing even if you didn\'t want to order. That would encourage guests to come up there and likely eat later or next time. \r\nHousekeeping did a great job too and the security guards in the lobby/street level were very helpful and friendly too. It felt safe at this hotel and professional.\r\nOh, we got great rate on a Sunday night stay (something like $100) but then the next couple of nights were quite expensive so we used points for those nights.\r\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay - felt like it was a treat to be there - and we would definitely return!'
5,'Amazing Hotel + Excellent Service = Magnificent Stay','I have just returned from a week at the Affinia Manhattan and I can say it was the best hotel experience I\'ve ever had; my entire stay exceeded all expectations.\r\nThe hotel is magnificent and I have never experienced such incredible service before. The rooms are incredibly clean and extremely large, atypical for New York hotel rooms - my friends who live in New York said the room was larger than their apartment - and the beds are SO comfortable that on a few occasions it was hard to drag myself away from the hotel to tour New York. Every staff member I encountered, from the front desk to housekeeping, was incredibly courteous and friendly and made me feel very at home. From the moment I checked in to the moment I left I experienced nothing but warm, friendly, 5-star service.\r\nI should add that once at LGA my flight home was cancelled and I could not get out until the next day, but rather than booking a hotel close to the airport I decided to go back to the Affinia in Manhattan because of how wonderful it was. That says a lot!\r\nThe location of the hotel is perfect: 1 block to subways, a few blocks walk to Times Square and lower Manhattan and everything in between. A very pleasant surprise was that room service from the attached restaurant was very affordable, and very delicious. And there is a convenient 24hour deli/grocery store 2 doors down to stock your room\'s kitchen. The kitchen was a nice thing to have even if only to store beverages.\r\nOverall I would say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I am quite particular! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone, and in fact I\'ve already recommended it to friends, family, and to my company\'s travel department. An amazing hotel in an amazing city!'
2,'Power Outages and Fruit Flies...This hotel is trying to be something its not!','This was our first trip to New York City and we had heard that the best thing to do was to book through Priceline. We set the parameters for a 3 ½ star hotel in midtown. Priceline booked us into the Hudson on West 58th. The website for the hotel had great pictures and seemed like a very nice chic hotel. I checked tripadvisor for reviews and was a little concerned with what I read. In an effort to make our stay as seamless as possible, I sent an email to the hotel. I just wanted to make sure we would get a non smoking room with a queen bed, I didn’t think that was too much to ask. When I did not hear back within 2 days, I emailed the hotel again; still no response. I then decided to call the hotel and spoke to a lovely young lady (Diana) at the reception who was extremely helpful. She even suggested that I contact the concierge desk to get some suggestions on what to do and where to eat. She graciously transferred my call. There was no answer at the Concierge desk, so I left a detailed message with 2 phone numbers where I could be reached. Once again, no one contacted me. After 2 days, I was starting to feel nervous, so I called the hotel and left a message with Assistant Front Office Manager expressing my concern with the lack of response I had received. He called me back and left me a message letting me know that the hotel had upgraded us and had asked the concierge to contact me. \r\nWe arrived at the hotel and we very impressed with the lobby and then the Front Office staff. A young man by the name of Chris checked us in and was fantastic! I can’t say enough about the staff and their desire to exceed their guests’ expectations. I feel bad for them as they are continuously having to apologize for the hotels shortcomings. \r\nWe eventually made it to our room. Now if you are looking for a large room, this is probably not the best place to book. The rooms are small, but if you have travelled through Europe, this won’t bother you. I am sad to say that it all went downhill from there. \r\nMy husband took a shower the next morning and a bunch of flies flew out of the showerhead (yuk!!). Additionally, some of the tiles were cracked and not very clean. Once we killed all the flies, I took my shower and then proceeded to drying my hair. After about 2 minutes of having the hairdryer going, the power went out. We then called the front desk (they were very apologetic) and they sent the engineer to turn the power back on. I then resumed drying my hair and the power went our again!!! We called the front desk again and they said they would send the engineer once more. At this point I decided that I would be spending my morning trying to get my hair dry, so we headed out (wet hair and all) to start seeing the sights. On our way out, we mentioned our issue to the Manager (Jackie) in the lobby. She was very sweet an assured us that this would be looked into. I should mention that this was at 10 am. We returned to our room later that evening, around 8pm, to find that the power had never been turned back on. Although the bed had been made, the fact that there was no power would lead me to believe that the maid did not vacuum or clean the bathroom. The room was blistering hot as the air conditioning had not been functioning all day (no power). We called the reception, yet again, and explained our problem. The hotel employee was very apologetic (again) and assured us that the engineer was on his way up. After waiting 15 minutes in a warm dark room, someone walked by our room and poked their head in and went to the power panel to turn the power back on. I then went into the hallway to ask him why this kept happening. He informed me that maybe I shouldn’t use my hairdryer. There is more to our stay at this hotel, but I think I’ve mentioned enough to give you all a taste of what to expect.\r\nFrom the exterior this seems like a very trendy spot, but it ends there. The management of the hotel need to start investing money in getting the rooms up to standard. Until this happens I cannot in good conscience recommend this hotel.'
3,'A recepção do Park Central hotel N.Y','O ponto alto do Hotel é a localização e o atendimento no check in e no check out.\r\nTivemos a oportunidade de conhecer ELLEN ao chegarmos .Foi ela q prontamente nos disponibilizou um quarto p/ nos acomodarmos . Tinhamos reserva de dois quartos mas chegamos muito antes do horario previsto p/ o chek in. Nossas duvidas eram sempre tiradas na recepção pois nos sentimos bastante acolhidos por Ellen .\r\nFizemos nosso chek out com ela e recebemos o mesmo carinho.\r\nOobrigada Ellen, foi muito bom estar com você\r\nSonia abreu.\r\n.'
3,'Great Location to explore NYC','Our first time to NYC and our first time to America as well. After a ton of research on the web (and mainly tripadvisor.com!) I choose this hotel because of location and budget. I took my girlfriend (whom is now my fiance - i proposed in Shakespeare\'s Garden - Central Park) as she had always wanted to experience the Big Apple! \r\nWe stayed for 7 nights in a queen size room on the 7th floor. Our room was okay but not very romantic, but it meant we could spend more on the sights of New York City.\r\nBeing from Australia i noticed a few things that i found odd - \r\n1. No switches on the powerpoints (which i think is a bit dangerous)\r\n2. When you flush the toliet the bowl fills half way up ( which i think is a waste of water considering we\'re trying to conserve water!)\r\n3. There are heaps more people out once the sun goes down!\r\n4. Initially I found the locals quite rude but please remember that you are a tourist and they see them all day everyday and they actually like it if you treat them the same way!\r\nIf your on a budget this is a great place to stay to simply sleep for few hours and then continue exploring this amazing city. \r\nWe\'re keen to go back ASAP!\r\nCheers Stephen\r\nP.S Our computer died only a few weeks ago and we lost all our New York photos which is quite shattering but a lesson learnt -keep a duplicate of all digital photos if not 3+ sets.'
4,'Good experience.','I was a little worried based on the mixed reviews previously posted. However, we asked for a renovated room, and found our room to be clean and comfortable. The crowds of people in the lobby gave it a casino-like atmosphere. Did not eat in the hotel as plenty of places to eat in the city.'
5,'New Yorker Hotel - grosses Hotel - kleine Zimmer - aber ideal','Ich war zum zweiten mal im Ramada New Yorker Hotel in New York. Das New Yorker Hotel befindet sich direkt hindet dem Madison Square Garden, unweit der Penn Station. 481 8th Ave - für jeden der schon mal in New York war, der weiss, das ist wirklich mitten drin und in absoluter gehnähe zum Times Square.\r\nDie Zimmer sind sauber und realtiv gemütlich eingerichtet. Wie allerdings in fast allen New York Hotels sind die Zimmer auch hier sehr klein. Viel Staufläche für die ganzen Einkaufstüten gibt es nicht.'
4,'Location, location, location','My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights after our trans Atlantic crossing on the Celebrity Silhouette. As we were wanting to see some shows whilst in town, we chose this location as it is in the heart of the city and therefore convenient. We had debated staying at the InterContinental, but in the end chose for this property as it was recently renovated and, once again, location.\r\nCheck-in went well despite the franticness (large groups were checking out and even larger groups were checking in -- this was the NYC Marathon weekend, we soon discovered). Being a PC Royal Ambassador, we were able to check into our room but as it was not ready yet, we just went to lunch as we were in no rush. We were upgraded to a nice room on the 39th floor with great views of the Hudson River. We had enquired about a room overlooking Times Square, but as the hotel was full, it was not possible. \r\nOur room, a handicap room (which we did not mind) was great. Very large, roomy and a big bathroom with lots of space. Figuring the shower out was tricky, but when we figured it out it went well. The sink area was very cramped and we could not keep much there as it was full with other amenities. Near the toilet were still notes left by the construction / refurbishing people that was now seeping through the wallpaper. Not too nice to see Put here on the wall (could have other connotations). The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed that it was high, which gave us the opportunity to look out over to the Hudson River and beyond as we lay in bed.\r\nMy main gripe was the poor climate control in the room. The temperature was either warm or hot. There appeared to be a sensor that would activate the a/c in the room, but despite that it would get uncomfortably warm in the room. Luckily we were able to open one of the windows, which made us realise how lucky we were not to be facing Times Square! But despite this, the room remained warm at all times and we had to make do, unfortunately.\r\nThe Club Lounge was a joke. We went once for breakfast, but it was so crowded and messy that we avoided it the rest of our trip. I certainly hope that it will be improved as this was not acceptable by any means.\r\nService by personnel was good. The cleaning crew always did a great job cleaning and were great when my partner was bed-ridden for two days due to some injuries to his leg. Front desk were efficient, but impersonal at times. Concierge team was fine, the little we interacted with them. Just a bit disappointing when we asked for assistance when we needed crutches and all I got was maybe try Duane Reed.\r\nOther areas of the hotel were well looked after and clean. The lobby area was a bit crowded and loud, but with the marathon that weekend and what appeared to be another convention, it made the hotel feel even more crowded and hectic. \r\nLocation-wise the hotel cannot be faulted for those wanting to be in the heart of it all. The major theatrical productions are within walking distance from the hotel (and I mean at times footsteps away) and having the TKTS booth close by was also handy (although the downtown location is better as it is open in the mornings, allowing you to be free the rest of the day to shop or sightsee). Being so close to Times Square means it will always be busy, crowded and noisy - didn\'t matter what time of day! Some may enjoy this, but it can be exhausting for others, so travellers need to keep this in mind.\r\nAll-in-all a good hotel for those wanting to be in the heart of Manhattan, but I will probably opt for other hotels next time in areas that are not as hectic and a bit more personal.'
4,'alt aber guter Standard','Sehr zentral gelegenes Hotel am Grand Cetral Station also 42 Strasse. Ein Altes Hotel mit dem Charme der 70er. Wers mag und keinen Designer Kram erwartet der ist hier richtig. Für amerika und ins besondere New York EXTREM grosse Zimmer. Auch die Standardzimmer sind gross. Wers also etwas üppiger mag und viel Platz bracuht ist hier richtig'
5,'Great Location!!! Clean.','Stayed for 2 nights. Great Location. In the middle of the city. #3blocks from Macy\'s. 10 Blocks from Time Square (15 minuite walk). Staff was nice and energetic. Though they do need to work on their direction giving skills. The bathroom was a bit small for my taste but it was clean. The bed was huge! Very comfortable. And if you sign up on their website and tell them you want certain amenties its there waiting for you in the hotel room.'
4,'Recommend the Grandy Hyatt','PROS: Excellent location, steps from Grand Central Terminal, easy walking distance from all midtown Manhattan locations. Clean and spacious, our room also had a nice view of the 42nd Street entrance to Grand Central with plenty of daylight. Very roomy by NYC standards. The service from both the front desk and conceierge was excellent. I\'m usually suspicous of recommendations from the Conceiege for restaurants, but we had excellent recommendations. The beds were very comfortable. Price was very reasonable. All the staff we encountered during our three night stay were cordial, friendly and professional. The lounge was cozy without being cramped, with small seating areas for a small group to gather on a couch around drinks at the end of the day. The modern decor was also nice. Windows in rooms open!\r\nCONS: High speed Interenet service through T-mobile did not work. We weren\'t given enough towels and had to ask for more, but they were delivered quickly. The modern decor in the bathroom is attractive but at the cost of essentially no counter space around the sink. For some reason, the chambermaids felt it necessary to remove the bathtub drain. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant is very expensive (about $25 minimum per person as I recall). Good if you\'re on an expense account. If you\'re on vacation, go elsewhere.'
5,'ottimo per visitare NY','camere piccole ma pulite\r\nesci dall\'albergo e ti trovi su time square ........... posizione perfetta\r\nbuono anche il prezzo considerando che siamo a NY \r\npersonale gentile e disponibile'
4,'Not perfect, but quite good','We got a studio suite and found that the room was very large indeed! It contained a kitchenette which was useful and plenty of room to spread our luggage out. There was, unfortunately, construction on our floor, though, except for being a little unsightly in the hallway, didn\'t impact on our stay in the slightest. \r\nOf course, the location is quite good. It\'s not in a neighbourhood with lots of great restaurants, but it is close to all transport and nothing is further than a 10-15 minute cab ride. \r\nI found the hotel bar to be excellent value - pretty good cocktails for just $10!! I enjoyed a few pre-pre-dinner drinks here and was very pleased. Nice bar staff as well. \r\nI suppose my only complaint was that there was no one to help us take our luggage up to the reception desk from the main entrance. We had a LOT of luggage and I had to make multiple trips up the staircase leading to reception - plus it was really hot out, so I was fairly sweaty by the time we checked in. That said, once we checked in, a man came and took care of our luggage very courteously and brought it to our room. A nice man, as well. \r\nUnfortunately, after checking out and paying, I had to repeat the luggage relay down the stairs and was nearly to JFK before my short dried out!\r\nThat said, our overall experience was a positive one and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend a few days in the city.'
1,Outdated,'I could not be more dissapointed! Ou room was so outdated I could not believe it! We had room 17-255 and the floor was uneven, the bathroomtowel rack was holding on for dear life. Our oom looked like it has not been remodled or touched since they originally built the hotel. The staff is great but I will never book a night at this hotel again!'
4,'Great deal for the money!','I stayed here with my husband and for the location and price, you cannot go wrong...if you can find something better you WILL be paying MUCH more! I enjoyed our stay, the line was a bit long but besides that we had a wonderful time being so close to everything in the city!'
4,'nice but not worth the cost','me and my mate went for new years eve 06/07 we arrived 27th dec 3pm new york time, 5hrs in pasport control, not a good start, got to the hotel after some very bad traffic at 11ish. they had give our room to someone else so had to share a bed with my mate, they gave us vouchers for a breakfast each and a dinner in the hotel. room was very clean, we got a paper for just 1 day then never had another 1 for the rest of the holiday, the hotel is in a good location, close to a lot of sights rockefeller centre is only a min walk, the only problem with this hotel is the price, we paid about £600 each just for new years eve and new years day, but we couldnt get in anywhere else so had to pay it other than that it was nice'
5,'Not half as bad as expected','Hi all\r\nI stayed in the hotel pann from 5th-8th september, and despite some of the reviews on here, I found it to be a brilliant stay!\r\nGot to the hotel at about 2:30pm, and checked in within 5 mins. Reception very helpful.\r\nOut of the elevator on floor 13, and yes, it was a bit like the shining, but quite frankly we wernt there to stay in the corridor. Also, the hotel date back to before titanic sunk, so what are you expecting?\r\nInto our room (1399) and it was large, spacious, clean and none of this mould/peeling paint.\r\nBathroom was modernised, amazing powerful shower, huuuuge bed and tv/fridge/air con (did not use as happy to sleep with window open, soak in that nyc atmosphere). The furniture was slightly dated but we didnt mind that, as long as it was clean.\r\nThe view was equally amazing, had a close up view of the empire state one side, macys on the other, what more could I ask for?\r\nFor the money we paid, we were very very very impressed, you pay for 2 star so expect 2 star, but our room felt more like 3 star to be honest (Ive seen much worst 3 stars durning my holiday repping days)'
3,'Poor Rooms but excellet location','Stayed at Pennsylvania Hotel from the 12 to the 14th of December and it was more or less what I expected after reading several Trip Advisor reports.\r\nI reserved (in October) 2 nights through otel.com (not hotels.com) and it was the best offer over the internet. Through internet I paid in advance 250 €, all taxes included, for the 2 nights, for a double bed room for 2 people. When I arrived everything was paid for. At the reception they asked me for ID and a credit card for security reasons.\r\nThe hotel is super central, right across the street from Penn Station and Madison square Garden. It is located on 7th Avenue, 2 blocks from 5th Ave, about 5-10 min walk on 7th Avenue to Times Square (you could see it from the main door of the hotel), I think 3 blocks from the Empire State Building and 1 block from Macy\'s. \r\nBreakfast wasn’t included in the price but you could get something to eat at a Lindy’s restaurant that exists in the hotel. Breakfast with pancakes costs around US$14 (don’t forget: +tax, +tip). We ended up having breakfast at a Sparrows across the street. Here an all you can eat breakfast (although you have a guy putting what you want on a plastic plate) cost $10 (taxes included). Don’t need to leave tip here since it is self-service. This breakfast buffet was basically greasy foods (not the healthiest) and included sausages, potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, pancakes, toast (all pre-made and ready to serve). Not a delicious cozy place but good enough to start the day in NYC without spending a fortune on breakfast. They also served other things, like pre-made salads, fruit salads, coffee, and for dinner: pizzas, lasagnas, etc… \r\nBesides Sparrows, across the street from the hotel, you have a Mc.Donalds and small mini-markets where you can get milk, some cereals, and other basic food products. For cheaper junk food (pizzas, hot dogs, etc) you could also go to Penn Station. \r\nBe aware that this area, restaurants, fast-food joints and shops, have a big ethnic variety and many of them may not be the cleanest of places nor have big worries about hygiene. Many of the people that work in these places hardly speak English. The entire area around the hotel, 7th Avenue, from the hotel up to Times Square looks the same. It is very central, very colorful, with lots of people walking on the very busy streets giving you a feeling of safety and therefore I consider it the best area to be, although it is also quite dirty looking. \r\nAs for the hotel, lobby was very nice and modern, with lots of middle/upper-middle class looking guests (Portuguese standardsJJ) from all over the world (coming and leaving, by the hundreds, with shopping bags). We were lucky and didn’t take more than 10 min in line for check-in. It is a very big hotel. With more than 1.000 rooms. I assume that around check-out time (12 pm) there could be a bigger line, since everybody could be trying to check-out at the same time. There are 4-5 counters at the reception desk. \r\nAfter reading trip advisor reviews we asked, during check-in, for a higher and newer room. We were told that all rooms were the same and that there were no new rooms so they gave us a room on the 7th floor. Didn’t see other rooms so can’t say if I got one of the better or the worst ones. \r\nThe room wasn\'t all that nice: old and not spotless clean: The room had a window with view to another section of the hotel. Basically the view was to another part of the hotel’s building (but of course there are rooms facing the busy street. I don’t know how you get them thoughJ). On the side we could barely see the street. The floor in the room was a bit dirty (not spotless), a bit of dust and paint from the wall in back of the TV, in corners, around the electrical settings. The bed sheets looked clean (which was essential for us to stay in the room), one of the bathing towels was stained (don’t know if it had been washed or not so didn’t use it just in case). They had shampoos and soaps. Bathroom looked clean although things looked old. The shower had paint coming off from the floor and sides. If you are fussy better bring some sandals for the shower and slippers for the room. In the room, there is a phone (with the possibility of receiving calls and messages), a small closet and an ironing board. TV was also old but functional, it had the regular American channels for NYC. Not much space for the 2 suitcases we brought but we managed to move things around in order to have them open and on the floor so we could easily take things from them. The doors of the room looked reinforced so it seemed pretty safe inside.\r\nThe corridors of the hotel could look a bit scary (especially for a woman alone) since they are old looking, wide and you don’t always have people walking around. There seem to be some video cameras in some parts of the corridors, I suppose for safety reasons. The safety is related to it being such a big hotel, with so many people, making it easy for an outsider to get in the hotel without being noticed. There are also other entrances to the hotel besides the main entrance. There is however a man, by the elevators, who is supposed to be asking the room keys as you go bye although he never asked us to show him the keys. \r\nThe hotel also stores luggage after you check –out for US$4 a piece.\r\nCan’t say staff wasn’t polite. They were nice (not too nice) but nice and polite enough. I suppose for NYC standards they were ok. \r\nI had a small problem although that was rapidly solved: The night before I checked out I called the reception from the room and asked if it was possible to check-out at 3 pm since my flight was at the end of the day. At first they told me the latest I could check-out, free of extra-charge, would be at 1 pm but then they accepted the 3pm. The next, day, when I came to check-out, at the reception, they told me I was supposed to have left at 1 pm since there was nothing in the computer system that said I was allowed to check-out at 3 pm, so they charged me half a night (about US$60). I was upset and complained but was in a rush to get to the airport so I paid and left. They gave me an e-mail to complain to, so the first thing I did when I arrived home was to write to this e-mail address (I think it is the manager’s). They rapidly replied saying they would give me back the amount they charged, so I suppose overall I was well treated. \r\nOverall I think it was worth it and I would stay back at the same hotel...specially because of the excellent location and relatively low prices for NYC. But I knew what to expect and was prepared: It is an old, big, 2 star hotel. Maybe not advisable if you have a toddler that could put his hands or mouth everywhere like on the dirty floor or electrical wires in back of TV.\r\nIf you are very fussy with cleanliness you better go somewhere else, but will certainly pay much more and will be hard to get something right in the center. Another inconvenience is that these other cleaner hotels (check Park Savoy near central park) could be on emptier streets which could make it more unsafe to walk, especially at night (in the winter it is dark at 4pm), to the main and popular points of interest, so take this into considerations before you reservation. Another possibility could be to stay at more distant hotels (located out of Manhattan, near the airports (Newark or LaGuardia) or somewhere else, that are served by the subway/train system allowing you to get a better and cleaner hotel for a cheaper price and fast access to Manhattan (beware of train fares that could get expensive depending on your location).'
4,'mejor de lo que esperaba.','Llegamos el 20 de mayo del 2012 a las 2:30pm y en 10 minutos ya estabamos en la habitacion. Solicitamos piso alto y nos ubicaron en el piso 17. La habitacion era grande y comoda, con 2 camas, mesa con sillas, nevera pequeña y un closett grande. Todos los dias fue limpiada y se cambiaron las toallas. Aunque necesita mejoras en algunas areas como el baño y el sistema electrico el mismo se ajusto completamente a nuestras necesidades. Dormimos bien, sin ruidos y el servicio fue bueno. La ubicacion de este hotel lo hace muy atractivo para moverse sin nigun problema dentro de la ciudad de nueva york. Aunque no tiene WiFi, esto permitio que nuestros hijos adolecentes compartieran mas entre ellos como hace tiempo no los veia, a su vez se olvidaran de la tecnologia, que al final es el proposito de las vacacionbes, compartir en familia y evitar la rutina. Gracias por todo.......'
4,'No problems here','This is, I believe, the third hotel I\'ve stayed in which has been largely trashed on here but yielded no problems at all for me and my family. Check in and check out were smooth as silk, a lost room key was replaced with no grief and the staff couldn\'t have been more considerate. Yes, the rugs are due for some serious shampooing, but the beds were fine and the bathroom large and clean.\r\nSome people must set their standards so high that no hotel could reach them or perhaps they hit them at a bad time. Whatever the case, the Park Central did just fine by us.'
4,'great hotel in excellent location','Large impersonal hotel, but very nice rooms and perfect location to be in the center of the theater district.'
3,'Not for people with small children - but great location!','I guess in New York one can\'t expect too much of hotels, but with a brand name like this one I certainly had some expectations. The location was great, right next door to Grand Central and within walking distance to Times Square, 5th & 6th avenues, Top of the Rock, Central park etc. But service left a lot to be desired. The rooms were quite small even though we were at a super deluxe king sized one ( or so they told us). Housekeeping never answered the phone and the room and bathroom only got cleaned after 3 days and that too on my insistence. Amenities like shower cap, shoe shine, cotton, coffee maker etc. are only available on request (even b&b\'s in UK provide these). But what irritated me most was the refusal to heat up baby\'s food stating the reason that outside food is not allowed to be heated! Seriously, baby food?!!! We stated there for 5 nights. I didn\'t find the staff there very friendly or helpful, though I have to say that room service were quite efficient. I guess the hotel is ok if you are travelling there on business, but is definitely not convenient if you stay with a little one! or maybe it could be down to the New York culture...'
5,'Excelente opção!!!','Este hotel tem uma localização perfeita! O hotel não é barato, mas vale cada Dólar gasto!!!! Bem no meio da Times Square, perto de tudo, acesso rápido a várias linhas de metrô, muitos restaurantes, farmácias, lojas de roupas, enfim, todo o tipo de comércio bem na porta do hotel! Os quartos são enormes e limpos! Funcionários muito educados e prestativos. Vários elevadores, ou seja, para subir ou descer era bem rápido! O frigobar não está disponível em todos os quartos, mas solicitei na reserva e não houve custo! Tudo correu perfeitamente. Nota 1.000! Voltando a Nova York, sem dúvidas, ficarei novamente no Edison!'
5,'Great Location for a Great Birthday','My wife and I stayed for four nights over Columbus Day week-end: our annual visit celebrating my birthday. Each year, for the past five, my wife and I fly in from Virginia. Each year, for the past five, our special occassion is cared for by Miliha. Additionally, this year, we received exceptional service from Hajar,easily a bonus on top of the caring attitude provided by Miliha. Miliha\'s level of service and professionalism on our behalf is impressive and greatly appreciated. Our room request has always been satisfied, the hotel presents extremely well, and the location is first-rate. This is an actively bustling hotel in the heart of Times Square, yet the hotel staff is never flustered, and always polite and accommodating. Thank you, again, Miliha and Hajar for recognizing old friends returning to the neigborhood.'
4,'Wrong Location, Right Location?','We stayed at the hotel for the first week of July, and changed to the Marriott Marquis when we discovered the Renaissance was under renovation.\r\nThe first impression was how busy the area around the hotel was. The Taxi driver had difficulty in getting to the reception area due to a festival in 46th and the people queuing for theatre tickets.\r\nOnce inside from the chaos, the hotel was excellent, check-in was fast and efficient, helped being a Marriott Rewards member.\r\nWe were shown to the room and luggage soon followed. The room itself was very clean and comfortable, although the bath was the shallowiest I\'ve ever seen. I have yet to find anyone that beats the Marriott beds for comfort, as a major plus.\r\nThroughout the week the maid service was very efficient, and the nightly turn-down provided a good size chocolate bar, not the normal small slither (chocoholics may be interested).\r\nI was not impressed with the lift set up. You called a lift and waited and waited, sometimes 10-15mins. Apparently this can occur if the hotel is very busy, but with 48 floors his should have been accounted for by the hotel.\r\nWe only had brunch in the hotel, and used \'The View\' restaurant on the 47th floor. Not the cheapest, but certainly good quality food and excellent, efficient service, our waiter \'Joseph\' was also a good guide to what to see and do in the city. The restaurant rotates and you get 75\% good views of the city (aside from the Viacom building next door). I think the lift on the way down was much faster due to the excess weight of food in me.\r\nWe had room service one night, lots of extra $\% on the cost, and we could have still been eating the next day, such was the quantity of the food, so value for money.\r\nAs a base the hotel was perfectly reasonable, except for the location. It has the right location, being close to Times Square and not to far from 5th Ave, Central Park, Port Authority Building and Broadway theatres, but I never imagined that so many people would be on the pavement all the time. Walking to and from was a real battle at times, especially having to second guess the person in front who would suddenly stop to take a picture of a neon sign (don\'t they have them elsewhere in the world?). I\'m used to walking the crowded streets of London, but people seen to walk slower in the US, as I bumped into so many. But the congestion and lifts are the only negatives of the hotel, and they can\'t do anything about the congestion!\r\nSome pointers for New York. \r\nThe hotel has many restaurants, but venture out, especially Chelsea, Soho and Greenwich Village, lots of diners and restaurants. Our favourites were,\r\nGotham Bar and Grill - pricey but excellent food and service\r\nJewel Bako - small japanese restaurant, have the chef\'s selection.\r\nL\'Ulivo - small Italian place, fantastic lunch\r\nWe organised some \'tours\' - \r\nSex and the City tour - If you love the program (my wife), you will really enjoy it, it was supposed to be an 18 (R-rated) experience, but failed to live up to the hype. However you do see some interesting places, but the Cosmopolitan was light on alcohol and Magnolia Cup Cake too sweet for even my wife\'s tooth. But the guide was very knowledgable and in the whole a good value tour.\r\nLiberty Helicopters - we did the New York, New York flight (about 15-17mins up and down the Hudson. Fantastic sights, but disappointing you never fly over Manhatten.\r\nWoodbury Common - this is run by the Gray Line tours to a shopping outlet, 50 miles north of New York. You get some very good bargains from designer names. Ralph Lauren Polos at £17 equivalent each. One tip, get a locker when you first arrive.'
5,'Cheap and cheerful','Brilliant location and friendly staff. We asked for a twin room and were given two kingsize beds so that was a nice suprise. The rooms are basic but they are clean and this was fine for me as I literally just slept and showered there. Have already booked to go back there in a couple of months.'
5,'Best room and location','Excellent hotel in general. Our room was simply great, totally renovated, more than 40 sq. m. and a very elegant decoration. The bathroom was one of the largest I\'ve seen in a hotel, with all complimentary supplies you can imagine. We booked the room directly from the Hyatt web page, but I must mention that a friend of us that did it through priceline (at a 40\% lower rate) got a room that was a third of ours and that looked pretty old. I supposed that you simply get what you pay for. In our case the quality/price relationship was beyond our expectations (considering we\'ve stayed in some other NY hotels, like Marriott Marquis). In terms of location (from a tourist point of view) it simply can\'t be better.'
5,'Très onéreux mais emplacement parfait','Séjour du 24 septembre au 2 octobre après avoir lu les avis cela m\'a fait un peur d y aller mais l hôtel est parfait. La situation de cette hôtel vous permet de tout faire sur place sans utiliser trop de taxi. Nous somme parti avec deux enfant une de 2ans et demi et un de 8 mois séjour parfait! L accueil un peut froid au départ mais tout c est bien passer ! Conciergerie agréable et disponible pour tout les réservation et autre demande surtout que nous ne parlions très peu anglais. Un très grand merci à Ben qui parle parfaitement français et qui nous a beaucoup aider dans notre séjour !!! Merci ben !!!!'
4,'Great hotel and the location can\'t be beat!','Located just off of Times Square. The hotel is clean, the staff friendly and there is a diner and convenience store located next door. Our room was quiet and you couldn\'t hear the hustle and bustle of Times Square just around the corner. The room and bathroom size were sufficient. I will definitely stay here again.'
4,'Struttura e posizione invidiabili ma le camere sono vecchie','Nel ventre di Manhattan, un hotel unico e spettacolare (le ascensori che salgono e scendono sono tutte di cristallo). Purtroppo le camere sono molto vecchie e quindi non esattamente in linea con quanto si spende!!!'
5,'Palmer House a gem!','Amazing history in this property! They have done a good job of keeping it updated even though it has been around forever! the lobby is spectacular. One of our favorite hotels in the world!'
5,'Great Location, lovely hotel','My husband, 15 year old daughter and I stayed here in a double twin room for a 4 day break over the Memorial Day weekend holiday. We used our SPG Starpoints for 3 nights and had to pay for 1 night. We were lucky enough to be upgraded, stayed on the 40th floor and had free access to the executive club, which included breakfast and afternoon drinks. The room was a good size, spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated. My daughter loved the bathroom and having her own double bed! We received a turndown service each night and chocolates, which was lovely. The staff were friendly and courteous. The location is great if you love to be in the hustle bustle of things, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you hate crowds. \r\nThe weather was great whilst we were there and we were able to get out and about and see much of the city, however, since it was a holiday weekend the tours were all exceptionally busy with long queues and waits. We were advised not to bother going to the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island since there were 2-3 hour queues around Battersea Park, so we took the free Statton Island ferry and back, which was really nice. Also advised not to bother with the Empire State building due to excessive waits so we went up to the Top of the Rock, no wait, hassle, large crowds or anything, absolutely fantastic views, including the Empire State building, well worth the visit.\r\nIn all we had a truly wonderful trip and our daughter can’t wait to go back, she loved everything about the city and managed to spend an absolute fortune!!!!'
3,'Ok Holiday!!!!!!','I went to this hotel about 2 years ago with my college on a \'educational\' catering trip and i thopuroughly enjoyed the stay i was hardly in the hotel much so didnt really notice much about the interior so can\'t really coment on that, i loved the fact that the property was in a central location to everything.......i could walk to times square and back in 20mins. I loved that there were shops close aswell i managed to walk out the hotel and buy a pair of trainers and an outfit.......Was the once of a lifetime opportunity but would not go back to the hotel as i would want to spend a bit more on a hotel, was on budget, hence we stayed in this hotel.'
5,'Westin Times Square - consistently a favorite','Recently stayed at the Westin Times Square for a couple of days after Christmas. Having stayed there before with my wife and our daughter, the Westin is consistenty a favorite of ours as a resut of its excellent location, spacious rooms, courteous staff, cleanliness and heavenly beds. I recommend the Westin Times Square for any and all persons whose intention it is to frequent the Times Square attractions. In addition, the Times Square subway station is one short block away for a quick trip downtown. By comparison to other Times Square area hotels that we have stayed, the Westin Times Square is our favorite.'
2,コスパ悪???。,'新婚旅行?利用????。\r\n物価?高?ニューヨーク?????も?り?覚悟を??????????\r\n??れ以下???。\r\nゴミゴミ???るロビー?狭?部屋。\r\nスーツケースを広?る?も難????。\r\n部屋?ら?オフィス?窓。\r\n?風呂?水??ん??????????り。。。\r\n日本?ビジ?スホテル以下??。\r\nアメニティ?他?ヒルトン?????。'
3,'Dull, very small room and bathroom','The entire hotel is very dull, the reception, corridors, even rooms! There is hardly any lights. The room was too small, there was no place for our 2 suitecases. The bathroom was unbelievingly small as well. Good location, but I still wouldn\'t recommend it.'
5,'Would go there again','This hotel was recommended to us by a friend. We stayed at room 3703 with views on times square and Rockefeller Center. Hotel staff was friendly and always helpful. We got the WIFI for free. We were told by the employee that he\'s doing us a favor, but I guess everyone gets it.'
5,Perfect,'The Marriott Marquis is the nicest hotel in NYC. Beautiful room, beautiful view, and Beautiful lobby. Ask for a renovated room, so much nicer!!'
5,'Location, Location, Location','We took our daughter to New York City to celebrate her Sweet 16 and we stayed at the Crowne Plaza right in the heart of Times Square. The hotel was beautiful and our room was very nice. Plus, we had a view of Times Square! The location was just perfect and the show we happened to be seeing was at a theater right across the street. And when the hotel learned we had a birthday girl in our party, they sent a little something to the room - two slices of cheesecake and a bottle of wine! (Our daughter and her friend enjoyed the cheesecake, while my husband and I appreciated the wine.) What an unexpected surprise! I thought that was extremely nice and that the hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We would definitely stay here again.'
2,'Westin Times Square cheats customer on Starwood points','I booked the room for 7 nights using Hotels.com and spent over $3200. However westin refused to give me points towards my Starwoods because I made my reservations using Hotels.com and not directly through Westin. This is speacilly unpleasant because I paid the commison to Hotels.Com and not the Westin.'
5,'Great Hotel','Great hotel - the location is obviously excellent. I love the elevator system where you type your floor and get assigned an elevator. The check-in, concierge, bell man and all other aspects of the service were top notch. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are roomy with a couch and appear to have been recently redocorated. All of the amenenties and finishes match the level of a JW Marriott in my opinion. \r\nWe had breakfast in the 8th floor restaurant-it was ok, but not a top class breakfast like I have had in other hhigh-end restaurants such as Indy Conrad. In fact its quality was actually closer to a Garden Inn breakfast. Not worth the >$40 and all we had was two omelets.\r\nThe only complaint I have is the bath room wallpaper has some stains and needs replaced. Everything else in the room was beautiful. Despite this one complaint, I still decided to rate this property 5 stars and highly recommend it. But it won\'t be cheap!'
3,'buena ubicación','la ubicación es muy buena, pero la atencion es bastante regular, el front desk no ayudan con el español si no hablas inglés, si llegas antes de las 16 hs (check in) te crobrarán u$s 7.- por cada valija para guardarla, las habitaciones, piso 5 en mi caso, muy pequeñas, camas pequeñas con pasillo bastantes angostos, no hay wifi, te cobran por internet una fortuna el minuto, compensa la ubicación, frente al Madison.'
4,surprized,'I really cannot fault anything about our stay here.After reading some poor reviews I was very worried.We got to Hotel Pennsylvania at 11.30 pm and were checked in quite quickly.Our room was just fine even though the room is not very modern it was clean .Ours beds were made each day,which I did not expect.We had a two night stay here in April.It is situated in a good location.'
5,'Westminster Dog Show','We stay here every year during the Westminster Dog Show. This is a very comfortable and accomodating Hotel! The Staff are very friendly and helpful! The new room renovations are wonderful!'
1,'Stay Away','The best thing about this hotel is the location. The rooms that are shown online and in their brochure are not at all like the two rooms we experienced. Room #1 was not updated and the bathroom light didn\'t work. We switched to room #2 which was a little more updated but the TV and remote did not work. It took 2 calls to have someone show up. It took 2 individuals to fix the TV. The air conditioning did not work either. In the morning I reported it to the front desk. Renaldo was very dismissive and rude about the problem, he promised to send someone to look at it. When we got back to the room at 5P the room was over 80 degrees. The front desk person told me they didn\'t have record of the complaint! Again it took 2 calls to the desk to get someone to show up. They ended up replacing the AC unit in the room and it took several hours to cool the room down. Stepping inside the room door, the wallpaper was peeled away from the wall from the floor, 3 feet up the wall. The carpeting was buckled between the beds. Just not a pleasant experience. In the meantime I called and left a voice mail for the hotel manager. He never returned my call. \r\nThis was the worst hotel experience I\'ve ever had. I travel a lot. The hotel did discount my bill but it did not make up for a sub-par hotel. Bottom line, their advertising is bait and switch!'
5,'Perfect location for Thanksgiving Parade and Michigan Ave Shopping','We stayed at the Palmer House to be close to the Thanksgiving Day Parade. In the past we have stayed there and found the rooms very small and some what dated. We soon discovered the hotel when through a $170 million renovation since our last stay. We would rank the hotel with our stay at the Waldorf in New York. Very elegant, but family friendly. The lobby was nice to meet friends and take in the architecture from floor to ceiling.'
3,'All the necessities, great location','I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean and a good size. All the necessities were provided, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. \r\nIf you\'re expecting 5 star luxary then this hotel is not for you but if all you need is a clean. comfortable place to sleep and shower then this is perfect. It is in an amazing location, directly across from Penn station and within 10 blocks of Times Square and the Empire State building. It was good value and everything I needed.'
1,'This Hotel is a Kip!','Just back from a staying in the Pennsylania Hotel, and what a Kip (Dump) this is. We booked a Superior Room and had to move rooms after 5 mins. We got a somewhat better room, but it was still a Kip. Dark and dingy rooms, and the smell of damp was strong. So we just made the most of a bad thing. The staff never batted an eyelid at our complaint as I\'m sure they heard it all before, it way like water of a duck\'s back to them. Never again will I stay in that kip and I\'d strongly recommend you to stay away from it. On checking out, the staff never asked if we enjoyed our stay, or asked if we\'d return to their Hotel, because they know it\'s a Kip too.'
4,'Big and Central','I stayed 3 nights in July. So here are some of the pros and cons of this Hotel. (brief and to the point)\r\nPros - \r\n1. You damn smack in the middle of Times Square. For this location is centrally located to Broadway and Big City Lights. We had tickets to Spiderman and its easy to walk to.\r\n2. Huge building and plenty of elevators. They\'r quick and I liked the idea of selecting your floor and the computer tells you which elevator to satnd in front of...\r\n3. Large rooms. We were told that we were given an updated room. Room large but small bathroom.\r\n4. The View restaurant and Lounge is nice but if you\'re going to take advantage do during the day. You see for miles. Cocktails average $16 so your going to pay for the view for sure. They had a buffett as well and its a little over priced. Too many other options in NYC for this.\r\n5. Gym was nice size and had plenty to offer. \r\n6. Bed was comfortable. But I have to say after walking miles all day I crashed hard and didn\'t care.. \r\n7. Service was good. Not great but it was what I expected...\r\n8. Restaurant Row only a few blocks over..\r\nCons\r\n1. Your in the middle of people rush hour right out the door. I\'ve stayed now 3 times in Times Square and after this trip I think I prefer closer to Central Park.\r\n2. I used Priceline for this hotel and paid much less than the average. I asked at check in if they had a view of Times Sqaure...Yes they did...$75 more a night...No way...\r\n3. If you like personal service at a hotel you\'re not going to get it here. Its a HUGE place and frankly they get you in and out...\r\nIts neat being in Times Square. If its your first time I recommend. If not...There are great Hotels outside of Time Square. Location is perfect for Broadway shows..\r\nJBH'
5,'Modern Decor, Comfortable Room','Our room was on the 22nd floor with no view. However, since one is out and about so much seeing the sites, I really didn\'t care what I looked at. The room had recently been refurbished and although the design is very attractive, the finished work needed more attention. The shower, beautiful as it is, tilted wrong so the floor outside the shower stall was soaking. We had to use our towels to soak up all the water that was left. Beds were great and Hyatt has tried to create a healthy environment. All the mattresses were wrapped in plastic (I assumed to avoid any nesters) and all furnishings were covered in an upscale man-made vinyl like material. \r\nWe had a meal in the restaurant before the theater and service was excellent. The burger was cooked perfectly and salads were fresh.\r\nStaff was helpful and friendly. The Hyatt brand is known for its attention to their customers and we felt we were attended to. As others have noted, the location is excellent if you want to get around easily.'
3,'Nice hotel but one huge problem','Stayed here just this past weekend. Loved the hotel and it\'s location, so close to everything. Had a room on the Executive Floor, thought would be quiet and upscale for the huge price of the room. Had problems with extremely loud neighbors and couldn\'t get any sleep. Walls so thin you could hear every work they said. Called security once, nothing happened. Called again after 10pm and no one would answer the phone. Had to go down to the front desk to complain again. They sent someone up but didn\'t hear them even knock on the door. Luckily they left for a night of partying so it was quiet until about 8 am when they returned louder than ever. Probably won\'t stay there again. Should have knocked something off our bill. Plus the food offered on the executive floor was usually gone or so picked over, no place to sit. Pretty disappointing for the price.'
5,'Excellent Hotel, excellent Location, will definitely return.','The hotel has a fantastic location, right next to Grand Central Station and we enjoyed exploring NYC from this base. Our room was lovely, we were upgraded which was a nice touch. The entrance and lobby area is very impressive with waterfall features and beautiful flower arrangements.The hotel is very clean everywhere and the food that we ate in the hotel was nice too. Shops, restaurants and cafes are all located within the hotel which is also ideal, but obviously there are plenty of these in the city itself too and right on the hotels doorstep. We found staff to be very helpful, friendly and polite. We are planning another trip to NYC and we will be staying here again.'
4,'Lovely hotel in fabulous location','Great location - within walking distance of Empire State, Crysler Building, Macys, Bloomingdales, Central Park, National History Museum, Carnegie Hall, 5th Ave etc. Near to a subway station and bus stops that service battery park for Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.\r\nRooms - Large, very comfortable, cleaned daily, high quality bedding, no complimentary tea/coffee facilities but there is a Starbuks and an independent (highly recommended) coffee shop next to the hotel that do great breakfasts and drinks.'
3,'Trendy...but no room!!','We stayed at the Hudson for 5 days as last step pf our honeymoon in the States. I\'ll try to describe our opinion in a few words... The hotel is very interesting from an artistic point of view.It\'s very stylish, the furniture well studied and placed, peculiar lights ( which hardly show you your way, believe me!). The reception is beautiful and so is the concierge desk.The bar inside is also beautiful, with Kartell furniture, a glass floor and it is always crowded with people, mostly well in their thirties, well dressed and very early in the evening,when they just come back from work. The hotel is very popular among stylish and young people as a restaurant and for its terrace outside... We wanted to enoy the newyorker atmosphere so we did not mind the loud music in the afternoon till night.we had dinner at th erestaurant, which struck us for being so DARK... I just tell you that I had to ask for three candles ( one by one...at last I must have sounded quite annoyed for that), because I could barely see what I ordered! The food was good, but we just tasted it, never seen it and in addition to that wine bottles were extremely expensive ( almost everywhere in New York ) and the menù choice was very poor...so I would not recommend the restaurant personally.\r\nLet\'s come back to our check in. We arrived quite late and tired, about 21.30..and surprise..we were left at the reception where we had a seat waiting for our room. This all took more than 40 minutes, how come? we booked our room and it was late in the evening, why shouldn\'t it be ready??? At the very first sight the room caught our eyes because it is very minimal and well designed...but we suddenly found out how small it was.Extremely small! The room is actually just a bit wider than the bed itself ( not a proper double bed), plus a mini closet ( filled with the safe and a hi-fi), a desk and the again extremely small bathroom. I must say everything was clean, but no space for our luggage at all!We had to put it over the bed during the day to walk around the room ( hitting continuosly the tv, the desk, and my husband ..). The bathroom was also trendy, I liked the shower which was separated by the bedroom from a transparent window with a stylish curtain.\r\nThe position of the hotel is very good, well served by public means and surrounded by restaurants, fast food, internet cafè and drugstores. \r\nThe staff was quite ok, especially the guys/girls employed at the concierge desk.\r\nI don\'t know what my review might suggest you, but I would recommend thi shotel just for young couples and people, to people not looking for much relax ( it\'s loud ) and expecially to those who appreciate interior design. I don\'t think it\'s place for families or older couples at all! It\'s trendy, it\'s fashionable, it\'s cool...but in one word it\'s not comfortable to stay intheir rooms!'
5,'Great Stay For The Fourth!!','stayed here for the 4th of July back in 2010, the staff were welcoming and friendly and happy to help organise any sightseeing or tours you wish to travel on, would recommend the Hudson boat trip.the rooms were spotless and cleaned everyday, the beds were very comfortable and you can order a specific pillow service is you wish, The Niles bar/Restaurant attached to the hotel was fantastic and all the staff (Hi Jimmy) were polite courteous & very helpful at all time, worth a visit would go back tomorrow if i could!!'
1,'Your worst nightmare','It is very out of character for me to book a hotel without thoroughly investigating it- but I found myself on a train into the city for the evening...desperate for accommodations. I found a room available at this place on Expedia and booked it. From the moment I walked up to it to find a homeless person urinating against the outside wall- to the 1 hour waiting line to check in- to the lobby filled with what seemed like hundreds of foreign student backpackers draped everywhere, this so called hotel was frightening!!!. I tried to find anyone in charge just to see if I could cancel my reservation, and it was literally impossible. The hotel is antiquated, dirty, and creepy. If it was empty- you could walk in and easily think it was an abandoned building, it is that neglected. I was so disgusted I walked out and checked into another hotel. There are soooooo many places in NYC to stay. Do not waste a MOMENT thinking of staying here. I would have been better off sleeping on the train I booked this reservation from.'
4,'Excellent location','Spent a week here recently for work and fun.The location is excellent with Times Square, Central Park and Rockefellar Center all within a couple blocks walk. There are multiple choices for close subway stations to whisk you away to any part of the city. The room was small and there was a constant, repetitive whooshing sound in our 6th floor room that we never did identify. It was probably the elevators, but it sounded like maybe the subway ran beneath the hotel. Could that be? I\'m fairly sensitive to noise but this noise wasn\'t bothersome. We couldn\'t hear much street noise with the windows closed which I thought was impressive for being in the city. The room service food was terrible and over priced so don\'t bother. There are plenty of restaurants and street carts to choose from so go grab some takeout if you\'d like to eat in your room.'
5,'Excellent Stay','Very nice hotel, i went with my family on a short trip and enjoyed it a lot. The staff were very helpful, very nice and spacious room...\r\nI will defenitly come back.'
4,'Great location','We have stayed in this hotel multiple times when attending conferences in the city. The location is convenient to the subway, museums, and so forth. In the past we have booked a standard room (as we did this time); however, we arrived late and as a member of Hilton Honors were imediately upgraded to an executive room for a slight additional fee. Included with this upgraded room is a private lounge where breakfast, coffee, light snacks, and Internet are provided. Access to a coffee machine (all day), buffet breakfast (fruit, cereal, and pastries), and Internet more than paid for the upgrade charge. \r\nOur only complaints about the hotel are that it is showing signs of wear and tear and the walls are a little thin. The bathroom in our room needed paint, carpet in the hall was a bit worn (being replaced the day after we left), and shrill voices of children in an adjacent room could be plainly heard.\r\nCheck-in and check-out for Hilton Honors is a breeze. The front desk workers --with the exception of one lady who was having a bad day--was polite and effecient.'
4,'Central Location and comfortable room','Not bad for being so close to times square. The hotel is gigantic, but the service is friendly and the accommodations comfortable. We were quite high up and the view was awesome. Not far from theatre row and access to all amenities.'
4,'A no-surprises Hilton','The rooms are NY-sized, but fairly well designed for two people to move around. We slept well, comfy bed, no noise on the 29th floor, very clean. \r\n We were there on both business and leisure, so the Midtown location was good -- very close to the park, theater district, Radio City for concerts, and MOMA. And right across the street from the W. 53rd Gourmet Deli, which we needed because the hotel restaurant was overpriced for breakfast and there was no in-room coffeemaker ( a serious failing, IMHO). \r\nAt the other end of the day, the hotel bar was great for a nightcap; pleasant bartenders making real drinks, nice atmosphere, and free homemade potato chips.\r\nOverall, service was good and efficient. My spouse and I disagreed on whether this or the nearby Sheraton is better for a reliable Midtown stay. It probably depends which rewards program you like better.'
3,'posizione ottima','Sono stata al pennsylvania nell\'agosto 2009.\r\nin sintesi l\'albergo non è di lusso ma, per una ragazza come me che viaggia da sola, era perfetto! Camera grande e abbastanza pulita.\r\nLa posizione davanti al Madison square Garden aumenta il valore dell\'albergo!'
4,'A surprise in the crowded tourist area','We stayed at this hotel as a 1 night stay for our anniversary so we could fully enjoy our dinner at Daniel and would not have to drive (good thing, 10 wine courses had me feeling pretty good). I was surprised at the professionalism and friendliness of the entire staff from the parking attendant to the bell boy. Being a local I shy away from times square and the craziness of the tourist scene but this hotel was not a tourist trap place. Our corner upper floor room had a beautiful view. Next time I spend a night in the city after dinner, I will spend it here.'
1,'Labor Day regret','Rooms are tiny. Front door closed. Jack hammering at 6:30 to replace sidewalk. TV sketchy trying to watch ballgame absolutely NO reason to return.'
1,Terrible,'Stayed 3 nights at this hotel enroute to Florida. Check in took a long time. It was really busy with a large queue formed in the spacious foyer. We arrived at 10 pm after a long flight. Got room key and staff were friendly. Got lift to room and upon lift door opening was faced with grubby carpet and smoky smell. Walked along numerous large corridors with no natural light and only dim lights to see. The carpet had rips, the paint was flaking off walks, it was horrible. We got to the room, it was light a dark dungeon but really large. The smell was off mould and the bathroom had seen better days. My son has asthma so we werent for staying with the smell as it would affect his chest. Went to reception and again was made line up after speaking about my complaint. Given another room and on checking it out it was no better, there were cigarette stubbs in an ashtray and the bed wasn\'t made. Again to reception and management give us another room. The smell was much better, but a very small and cramped room. By this time we were tired and accepted the room which had been paid for before arrival as it was a special offer (no wonder). If we had have arrived earlier in day I would have looked for another hotel. I can\'t say anything good about this hotel except its location. It reminded me of the film \'The Shining\'.'
3,'Very good location in the Chicago loop -- internet free BUT charge for Gym','I had a pleasant business stay. Rooms are very clean. The location is superb.\r\nInternet access was included. \r\nHowever I am very dissapointed that they charge a $10 fee for accessing the Gym ?! Not impressed.'
1,'Love New York – Hate this hotel!','Stayed here for 5 nights on Labor Day weekend. Have to say I was very disappointed with this hotel. \r\nThis hotel seemed to completely lack any personality, the staff were unhelpful and the interior was dark and dreary leading to a very moody atmosphere. \r\nHad paid extra for a ‘deluxe’ double bed room and it was ridiculously small, only suited 2 people with the amount of storage space and amenities, also didn’t seem to be cleaned very well at all, stains left on bed sheets! We also didn’t have much of a view at all, despite being told when booking that the ‘deluxe’ rooms were on higher floors leading to better views. \r\nSecondly, the bathroom was ridiculous, a see-thru sliding door with no lock? For a family in a very cramped this room this made things very difficult!\r\nThe mini bar, gym and Wi-Fi (very slow!!) are also all very overpriced!\r\nThankfully this amazing city made up for this awful hotel and we managed to enjoy ourselves.'
3,'bachelor hotel','stayed there for a week with two kids (13 years old)\r\n-good location ( 100 m far from the parc)\r\n-nice terrace\r\n-suite 700 OK / although most of the equipment start to age!\r\n-very dark in the room - almost no light to switch on!\r\n-club atmosphere in the lobby - loud music at night! \r\n-too loud if you are over 30!!!\r\n-clearly not a family hotel\r\n-'
2,'Compact !!','Just stopped at this hotel for 4 nights. The othet reviews said that the rooms were small. They were right. It spoiled the holiday. It was noisy, the rooms small and cramped, the bathrooms were tiny and the only facility was the safe, no kettle or any thing and no were to put one even if they gave you one !!! The only good thing was the staff. Avoid this one'
4,'Its all about the location!!','This hotel is great value and is worth every penny due to the excellent location. You are literally in the heart of Times Square. I would definitely stay here again for the location alone. The rooms are quite dated but the hotel is currently under going refurbishment. The staff was helpful & it was great that we could leave our bags in the baggage room for just 50 cent on our last day. The only major problem we had was on our journey from the hotel to Newark airport to take our flight home. We booked a transfer through the hotel with a really nice girl @ the Edison (was about $22 per person). Anyway once we arrived at the airport our driver handed us our bags and as we had become accustomed to in NYC we tipped the driver - then he started screaming in our face that he wanted more tip – in fact he said he wanted $5 per person. I just don\'t think its right that he could be so rude and ungrateful. I understand the importance of tipping & that’s what we did but to be shouted at & embarrassed like that was totally humiliating. I think if the Edison advertises these types of transfers it should be made known if there is a minimum tip. Next time we will be taking a cab!! Overall the Edison was a great place to stay in NYC & already looking to go back.'
4,'Great rooms and centrally located','I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan last week for business. I received a lovely and clean room. The staff was helpful and friendly. \r\nThis hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square. Great location and centrally located in the Theater District. I would definitely stay here again.'
2,'not what I expected from a luxury hotel!','The location is good, but that\'s about it. You\'re literally in Grand Central Station, so there are tons of restaurants, bakeries, and a Rite Aid right there. Plus you don\'t even need to go outside to get the subway.\r\nOur room had a very awkward lay-out, the sitting area in our deluxe king room was located behind the television. The lighting was terrible, the only lights in the room were the 2 bedside lamps and a paper-covered lantern in the corner of the sitting area. There was no desk lamp, which is odd, since the website says that they offer enhanced workspace lighting. No overhead light, either. There\'s no coffee pot in the room but there is a kiosk downstairs where you can get free coffee or tea in the morning. Our room didn\'t have any literature on hotel amenities, NYC events, etc., not even a room service menu. Drinks at the bar were overpriced - this is NYC, I know, but it was excessive - and the bar wasn\'t that great to begin with. Hyatt advertises special iPod stereos, we just had a regular clock radio in our room. The window was very drafty and didn\'t seem to close properly. The room was extremely dry and always either too hot or too cold, the thermostat didn\'t seem to work properly. There were scuff marks on the walls and wallpaper was peeling in some spots.\r\nWe were told that since I\'m a Gold Passport member, we would get a free NYT delivered every day. Instead, I had to call the front desk and practically beg for a paper. I was told that since we didn\'t get one for the first 2 days of our stay we would get one on Sat. and Sun. even though they normally don\'t deliver on weekends...but we never got the weekend paper.\r\nOne of the benefits of being a Gold Passport member is a late check-out, we were not allowed to check out late because the hotel was booked for the next day. \r\nThe front desk staff was very unresponsive. I called the desk around 6pm and it took about 5 minutes for someone to actually answer the phone - I stopped counting after 30+ rings on my first phone call.\r\nThe housekeeping staff was very pleasant, but the concierge was unhelpful. I had a stamped envelope that just needed to be dropped in the mail, but they wouldn\'t take it. They told me that I had to go to the business center on the other side of the hotel to mail it. \r\nThe gym was nice and looked like it was recently renovated.\r\nI would *NOT* pay full price for this hotel. Only stay here if you need to be right next to GCT or if you get it on Priceline. I wouldn\'t pay more than $100/night to stay here.'
5,'My excelent Stay','I had a wonderful stay at the marriot marque. I was suprised because the noise leval was amazing even before when we went to las vegas, the noise you could hear inside the hotel room.'
5,'Art deco heaven','Just back from a fabulous stay at this hotel. We booked based on 2 recommendations and they were so right! We got an upgrade as it was our wedding anniversary and ended up with a great view of the empire state building :-) great location (we walked everywhere but there are also cabs outside). Great amenities as there is a 24 hr diner next door and a bar on the other side plus gift shop downstairs etc. Room was very clean if small, but all new York rooms are the same and has a maid servic everyday. Great for a busy stay in new York.'
3,'Good location in Midtown','This is an older hotel in midtown manhattan. Sure it is a bit worn, but has seen alot of history of NYC. My room was fairly large, with light furnishings, small refrigerator, desk and tv/dresser combo. Bed was king size and reasonable decent. This is not a high dollar hotel, but is adequate for a visit to the city. However....\r\nThe location rocks! Walk to theaters, Times Square, across the street from Penn Station, very safe feeling area. I was out until late ( early morning) every night and it was fine.\r\nI would recommend using it if you don\'t spend much time in the rooms, however they work for what you want,,,,Sleep'
4,'Loved the Hotel for the price','I stayed in the hotel from the 24th of November till the 26th. I was part of 5 girls who went shopping and site seeing. After reading the reviews we were all nervous of the hotel. When we arrived we thought the reception area was lovely and was all done up for christmas which was really nice. It only took 5 mins to check in and we were given 2 rooms beside each other on the 11th floor. When we walked up to the room the corridors we not badly light at all as previous reviews stated. Both rooms were clean. The bathrooms were clean and had clean towels. The bedrooms were clean and warm very comfortable. The sheets and towels were changed everyday which was great and doesnt happen everywhere. \r\nThe location of the hotel was ideal were were only 2 mins walk from Macy\'s and around the corner from the empire state building which i would recommend to go at night. Time square was 10 mins walk. We were only about 5 mins walk from 5th avenue which was lovely to walk down it was all light up with christmas lights and was beautiful. \r\nWhen we checked out again it only took 5 mins and they offered us a room to store our bags while we waited to go to the airport. There was a lovely man in the storage room who helped us with them and was no delay in claiming them back. \r\nI would have no hesitation to book this hotel again for the location and price its well worth the trip.'
1,'Oh boy, newer going back there.','The doors and elevator didnt work, there was mould in the bathroom. The noise of the cleening personal in the morning was frustrating.\r\nThey took dubble internet fee, even if they promised to fix it earlier. I had to correkt them on check out! So I will not go back there again and I will not recommend it for enybody. Not on that price for 200$ at night.'
5,'Fun, affordable','I got an unpgrade to a corner room. Being in Times Square is always thrilling, and the room was huge and very comfortable. The hotel itself has been updated to be more modern, and the inside space is stunning. The location is excellent for first-time tourists. The room service was extensive, runs late, and actually a good value.'
2,'Better Choices','Priceline booked me with the impression this was 3.5 stars. In reality it eas 2.5 at most. It\'s hard to locate. When you find it, you go up a long escalator to the lobby. Unique and inviting - like a rainforest. \r\nChecking was simple. Went to my room. So small it reminded me of a cruise ship. lots of wood. Very awkward layout and had a cheap feel. \r\nDuring the night, the heat went off and it was cold. Also, the Internet stopped working. I called earlier and there was no response to my complaint. \r\nI ate at Hudson Hall. Very different. Expensive and forgettable. \r\nThe location is quite nice near Central Park. It is access able to all forms of transportation. \r\nI saw the manager at checkout. She was quite nice and comped my dinner in Haddon Hall. I also received an apology email with an invite to come back. I appreciate that, but the facility is just not what Priceline rated. It really is 2.5 stars.'
4,'Nice Hotel - Great Location','Stayed here on a business trip in December. Booked with priceline and got a fairly good deal at $150 per night. Sometimes hotels give the priceline customers the smaller/poorer rooms but the Hyatt gave me a large suite which was very nice. Very clean room and comfortable bed linens. Didn\'t really use any of the other hotel facilities but as a place to sleep I can recommend it. Great location right over grand central.'
4,'I love NY!!','sono stato con la mia famiglia nella mia amata NYC...ho scelto per la seconda volta di seguito l\'Hilton visto che la prima volta c\'ero stato veramente bene(avevo visto anche Richard Gere),ma l\'ultimo soggiorno non è stato il massimo visto che mi è stata assegnata una camera con due letti francesi e per 4 adulti non è proprio adatto.L\'hotel però è in una posizione invidiabile dietro alla scenografica times square,broadway,fifth vicino alla metro...nel cuore della grande mela!!l\'albergo è dotato di un centro fitness ben attrezzato...il personale è gentile e disponibile!!Il rapporto qualità prezzo per lo standard di NYC è abbastanza buono anche se c\'è sicuramente qualcosa di più economico ma per essere un Hilton...lo consiglio a chi volesse visitare la BIG APPLE!!'
3,'Pour la situation en hyper centre !!','Certes la chambre n\'est pas bien grande et le lit en 140CM n\'est pas bien large. \r\nL\'accueil anecdotique et le bruit de fond de la rue permanent, y compris au 16e étage.\r\nPour autant, la chambre était propre, bien que vétuste. Wifi Payant mais téléphone dans la chambre si votre famille souhaite vous appeler gratuitement via leur box internet.\r\nLe ménage y est fait tous les jours.\r\nNous n\'avons pas fait de queue pour avoir notre chambre, ni pour la rendre. \r\nLe dernier jour, une consigne gardée et gratuite est présente en sous-sol.\r\nEnfin, que dire de la situation de l\'hotel?!! Une fois que vous vous êtes repérez dans la ville, vous comprenez vite que vous êtes au centre de tout (10 min a pied de Times Square - lignes de Metro tout autour de l\'hotel - Macie\'s et le Madison Square Garden en face)\r\nLe rapport qualité/prix reste donc plus que convenable. Nous y retournerons.'
1,'GRAND HYATT -- NO - NO- NO - JUST DONT DO IT!!!','I took 3 of my good friends to the 5 STAR?????? Hyatt for some pre-Christmas shopping - I have been to New York several times before but stayed at 3/4 star places - I thought this time I would push the boat out!\r\nThis place is a nightmare and the staff are the rudest people on earth!\r\nWe booked our visit 4 months in advance and booked an executive suite with 2 double beds (we are two couples)... I emailed the concierge explaining I was coming to show off the worlds most amazing city to my very excited friends... they confirmed all the details ( I also rang just incase and they confirmed the confirmation!)... \r\nWe arrived to find that the hotel was overbooked and they only had 1 room with a kingsize bed left for the 4 of us to share... when I suggested that as we were 4 adults this would not do, the Front Desk Manager suggested we take turns to sleep on the floor... there were 8 people at the desk with the same complaint!! We were advised that we would be put on a waiting list for a twin double and as soon as our name hit the top we would be moved - it turned out that there were 38 names on the list - some staying 7 nights (God Bless them)....\r\nWhen I explained that this just was not on he said he did have another room that we could have if we paid him an extra $200 per night... He laughed in our faces when I explianed I had twice confirmed the booking and advised that they did not have anywhere for me to access my email account to show him the confirmation mail... This hotel is not 5 star - it is the worst place I have ever stayed and I would advise anyone to think very carefully before booking into this sham of a place....\r\nI do, however, still LOVE NEW YORK!!!'
3,'Great location, small room, limited breakfast.','Hotel location is perfect (beside Grand Central Station).\r\nRoom was small but clean and comfortable.\r\nBreakfast is not buffet, hence somehow limited if you want to take something not on the menu.\r\nPrice is high, but in the average for such quality hotel.'
5,'loved it...','This was my 3rd visit to New York. Everything was great...no complaints. The staff was very friendly. Most rooms in New York are really small. However, the room was larger than most hotels in New York. I have a bad back and beds were comfortable. This is the most central hotel in Times Square. Room service is expensive....$48 for a bagel, bowl of cereal, and pastries. I would highly recommend this hotel.'
4,'Unbeatable location','Great location to be in the heart of Times Square! But you pay to stay! Rooms very spacious, quiet, and clean. Could be one of the quietest rooms ever! Elevators top efficiency! As a gold member, found concierge lounge disappointing! Overcrowded, not enough seating, cold, average staff and food times crazy!'
4,'per chi vuole anche divertirsi la sera','Ho scritto questa recensione in ritardo perchè vedo tanti commenti negativi...le camere è vero che sono piccole ma ben organizzate, comunque carine. L\'hotel ha un bell\'impatto, la reception è gentile e il bar tra i locali più frequentati dai newyorkesi, quindi adatto a chi vuole uscire la sera prendendo solo l\'ascensore!!!'
4,'room with a great view','Hotel was very nice. Elevators were strange but easy to work and get around. Our room was very clean and the view of TImes Square was amazing especially at night. Location is great. We were able to walk to the theaters and all the main site seeing attractions. We visited the View Lounge after a long day, the drinks were excellent and the view amazing. Would definetly stay at this hotel again.'
4,'Great value & great location!','Couldn\'t of asked for a better location to see New York and was amazing value. You walk for about 30 seconds and your on Times Square.\r\nRooms were nice, the only one flaw in the hotel was the bathroom - the bath felt a bit scummy.\r\nThere is a diner right next door called Dannys which is pretty good for breakfast - pancakes and sausage / egg muffins went down a treat and set us up for the day of sight seeing!'
5,'Wonderful hotel in the heart of New York','The Marriott Marquis is located in the heart of Times Square and is at the high end of Marriott\'s chain of accommodations and appointments. It is easily reached by subway or taxi, and entered through a breezeway beneath the hotel. Elevators lead up to the 8th floor where the main lobby is located (convention rooms fill the lower floors). The elevators are accessed by typing your destination on a master pad, which then directs you to an elevator that is programmed to take you to the floor. Efficient, but confusing to everyone looking for buttons to push.\r\nThe staff at check-in is quick and efficient, although rooms were not available until 3 pm (people linger until noon before leaving). The room, on the 14th floor, was a corner room with a huge comfortable bed, large sitting area, and large bathroom. There weren\'t as many windows as might be expected, and there was a lot of wind noise. The room has a \'fridge, small mini-bar, flat-screen cable TV, and in-room coffee. There is wired internet access that keys to your computer, so if you have two machines in the room, you cant\' swap the connection. The tub-shower is great, with good hot water and pressure.\r\nThere are many good restaurants within easy walking distance, and convenience and package stores for drinks and snacks. Restaurant Row is a good destination for a wide variety of dining at reasonable prices, it is an easy two-block walk from the hotel. Many Broadway shows are similarly within a block or two, and the TKTS half-price office is just across the street at the center of Times Square.\r\nAt checkout, allow a half hour for your bags to be transferred to the breezeway if you are ordering a cap. They take the bags in the lobby, and assume that you will linger before appearing to pick them up downstairs.\r\nThis is a high-end property that is ideally located and appointed. The staff does a great job moving a large flow of people through the hotel, and is eager to help. Recommended!'
3,'buona posizione, pulito ma rumoroso e bagno piccolissimo','è un hotel di design firmato Philippe Starck, interessanti gli spazi comuni (in particolare la terrazza con una bella vista verso l\'Hudson) ma le camere sono piccole in particolare il bagno è inadatto a persone più alte di 1.80ml; inoltre i serramenti non attutiscono per niente il rumore della strada (continuo 24 ore su 24); è comunque un hotel pulito e recente; la posizione è buona, vicina alla metro Columbus Circle, al Central Park e a Times Square'
5,'Would definitely stay there again','It was my 6th visit to New York and my first time at the New Yorker Hotel.\r\nReasons for my choice were the awesome location and a good offer.\r\nLocation: The New Yorker Hotel is located at 34th Street and 8th Ave. next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The Empire State Building, Macy\'s, Times Square, etc. are all just a hop away.\r\nRight by the hotel is a Starbucks and a Duane Read where one can get all necessary stuff. \r\nThere\'s also a subway station - ideal location for shopping and sight-seeing\r\nEating: The hotel has a few own restaurants. The Tik Tok Diner is open 24/7 and offers a variety of typical US dishes such as burgers, sandwiches, etc. Prices are good too. Staff is nice.\r\nCheck-in: check-in was quick and easy. Front-desk staff was very nice \r\nRoom: my room was located on the 24th floor. I didn\'t have city view, but the room was light. (see pictures)\r\nRoom-type: Metro, 1 Queen-bed, renovated\r\nPrice: €630 for 3 nights - booked via expedia\r\nHaving stayed at several hotels in New York I was very positively surprised about the room. It looked modern, new and trendy. It included a desk, flat-screen TV, a little extra room for luggage / clothes, a bathroom, queen-bed, etc.\r\nEverything was tidy.\r\nRoom-size: New York is known for small hotel rooms. The room was not as small as expected and spacey enough for 2 people. (even enough room to move properly)\r\nBathroom: the bathroom was clean and served it\'s purpose. The hotel also offered a set of sanitary products.\r\nThe only negative thing was that not all of the towls were clean.\r\nGenerally the room was perfect.\r\nDownside: walls are very thin and it\'s a little noisy - you hear when the next-room neighbours turn on their shower or flush the toilet. Also the air-condition is very loud, but it can be turned off.\r\nHousekeeping: very nice \r\nCheck-out: Since my flight was late I asked for late-check-out.\r\nThe usual check-out time is 12:00 noon. You can ask for a free later check-out until 1:00pm. If you wish to check-out even later you have to call the front-desk the morning of your departure if the room was available longer. If so a late-check-out-rate of $75 has to be paid and you can stay up to 5:00pm.\r\nGround transportation: the guys are very helpful and help you with getting a cab / shuttle or whatever.\r\nExtras: the hotel has a business center as well as a fitness room. There is also a gift shop in the lower lobby with plenty of nice NY gifts. You can also get postcards and stamps there. \r\nBest thing free wireless !!!\r\nI loved my stay at the New Yorker and I will definitely book it again for my next New York trip - if I find a good offer.'
4,'hmmm, brand not consistent but my stay was fine','I chose this hotel because my stay was short and it\'s across from Penn station with easy access to EWR via NJ transit. I stayed at the Affinia in Chicago which was newly remodeled and considerably nicer than this one. As I was walking up to the room I distinctly felt like I was in a Holiday Inn from the 1980\'s. What a flashback. The price reflected this though and it was kind of shabby but the basic kitchen facility was great since I love fixing my own b\'fast with stuff I buy at whole foods. I wouldn\'t recommend this hotel for a special NYC experience but for a purely functional source of basic lodging it worked for me.'
5,'Great week in newyork','Stayed at the newyorker hotel its 34th on 8th ave great hoel very central,lovely staff and the tick tock diner is class,TGI Fridays is not far away and the molly wee irish pub on40th street is the place 2 go,staff couldnt do enough for you.'
4,'Beautiful Hotel, Great Location, But.....','we stayed 1 night at the Palmer House. The Hotel is beautiful, The Lobby is spectacular, Our room was beautifully decorated and clean. Service and staff were good. The location is in the middle of everything, but noisy at times. We could hear the train go by frequently all day and at night as well. This was our second visit to Chicago. Our first visit we stayed at the Drake,(another beautiful Hilton Hotel). If I were to return to Chicago I will definitely go back to the Drake. The Drake location was so much quieter. My husband and I were always approached by pan handlers outside the Palmer House, but did not find that at the Drake.'
5,'Great Location, Exceptional Hotel','This hotel was amazing, staff extremely friendly and helpful. Originally placed us in a room on the 28th floor and were more than accommodating when we asked if we could \'upgrade\'. Gave us a free upgrade to the 43rd floor, the higher you go the more you are supposed to pay.\r\nCentrally located, our room had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building and down onto Times Square. Several restaurants and cinemas just outside the doors. Port Authority bus terminal across the road and underground station on the corner.\r\nWould highly recommend anyone to stay, it\'s certainly worth it.'
3,'Marriott Marquis on Broadway','If you told anyone that you were visiting New York and staying in Times Square/Broadway, they\'d say You lucky Devil!\r\nThe hotel was clean and pleasant enough but it just didn\'t like up to my expectations.\r\nActually, for the cheap, tacky location of Times Square/Broadway, it fit right in.\r\nI would never have chosen this place (and I didn\'t, I was put up here with other business colleagues) and it was a world of difference from the last Marriott that I stayed in, in Tyson\'s Corner, VA, which was way, way better, as a hotel.\r\nThe place looked tired and my room was a hotchpotch collection of furniture that didn\'t quite fit.\r\nAll in all, I felt a bit tacky staying here, yet I\'m sure many people would love the place in the heart of this loud, glitzy and grubby area.'
3,'Adecuado para una primera vez en NYC','Es un hotel antiguo, eso no significa abandonado ni caido. Le faltaria una remodelación. Tiene una excelente ubicación. Igualmente en NY al hotel solo vas a dormir, por lo tanto lo recomiendo por el precio y la ubicacion. Si queres gastar mas, hay cientos de hoteles mejores, pero por el precio de este es adecuado.'
1,'Shocked and disappointed','This was supposed to be a celebration trip but this hotel nearly ruined our vacation. The biggest issue was that we were unable to get towels and washclothes, despite repeated requests to housekeeping, the front desk and management, for THREE DAYS. Our sheets were never changed, we received no turn down service and the room was dirty. We courteously voiced our concerns yet never received a response from the hotel or from corporate. We have always had great experiences with Westin in the past so this was a real shocker.'
2,'Overpriced for Closet size Rooms','Rooms were old and small. The hotel itself was nice and stunning but rooms are overpriced for the size. The room was over 150.00 per night during Christmas season for a holiday party and that was a reduced rate. The parking charge made it more expensive. So over rated. Won\'t stay there again anytime soon!'
3,'...senza infamia e senza lode...','L\'hotel non è niente di eccezionale, anzi.....è piuttosto vecchiotto! Quello che permette di rivalutare quest\'hotel è senz\'altro la sua posizione invidiabile, di fronte al Madison Square Garden e, dunque, a due passi da Time Square. Lo consiglio assolutamente, anche per le numerose offerte che vengono proposte e soprattutto perchè credo che, per chi vuole visitare NY, occorre solo ed esclusivamente un punto di appoggio che, se centrale, è il top!'
2,'Avoid this hotel','We had originally booked a room at the Park Central but cancelled our reservation when we read reviews on this website and discovered the PC had a terrible bedbug problem. The Hudson was recommended to us by someone who worked at Hugo Boss in the city. I think he had some connection or something. We stayed for two nights at $205/night but with all the taxes it ended up costing something like $475 for two nights. Don\'t expect charm. You enter the front glass doors and immediately ride up an escalator to a dimly lit reservation desk area with booming music playing to make it seem trendy, which I suppose it is. The bar is popular and although we tried to go in Fri. night, we were turned away because we didn\'t have a reservation!(for the bar) The ceiling in the bar (visible from the escalator)is artfully painted. The lighting is so dim in the hotel that near the elevators I could hardly see. We stayed in a standard room on the 12th floor. The hallway walls are all painted a very dark industrial gray, and the carpeting is also very dark. As stated in another review, the only lighting is small fluorescent lights above the door numbers. The room is teeny tiny with room enough for our queensized bed. It\'s true that the room was either too hot or too cold. The heating does make banging noises when it comes on, and the windows allow cold air to come into the room. And we could hear so much noise outside that we slept fitfully both nights. The bathroom is interesting...The sink is one of those modern ones that feels awkward to use somehow. A mere 8 away is the toilet and about 10 from there is the small tub. The wall inside the tub/shower is glass giving you a great view of the bedroom and vice versa! There is a thin curtain you can pull to afford yourself some privacy, but nonetheless if bathroom privacy is important to you (and it is to many women) forget this place! The place is definitely clean, and the sheets were nice and smooth, but honestly I couldn\'t wait to get out of there. I guess they think that darkness equals affluence or something like that. Frankly, I felt like I was getting macular degeneration. I hear the Holiday Inn is really nice on 57th Street and less money.\r\nLynn.'
5,'This place is amazing!','We were here for 1 night only but this place is amazing!!! The building is beautiful & the staff are warm & inviting after a long day of traveling! We chose as it was close to the Amtrak/Union station (5 min taxi ride). The rooms were big/spacious/clean & modern & the beds were soooo comfortable & soft. The concierge (Tracey) was really helpful & the bell desk (Sean) was so friendly & went above & beyond his duties & we were extremely impressed. This place I would highly recommend to any traveller.....we are returning to Chicago but staying in another hotel which if I had known I would have continued to stay at the Palmer House Hilton'
4,'Great Hotel in excellent location','We spent five nights at the Hilton at the end of May 2006 staying in a deluxe room on the 22nd floor in a room which, according to the receptionist, had recently been refurbished. It was very clean and comfortable with very soft beds, two chairs, a flat screen TV and safe. Couldn\'t fault it. \r\nLocation was great - we could walk to a number of the sites and rarely used the subway or taxis. \r\nWe had no problems waiting for the lift and didn;t eat breakfast in the hotel so cannot add to the comments made by others. We had a meal one evening in the Etrusca restaurant - pricey but very nice. Service was relatively quick.\r\nWe needed a taxi to the airport about 6 pm on the Friday. In the morning I asked about this and was told just to turn up at 6 pm. However, when we did this we found there was quite a queue and had to wait for about 30 minutes. You do have to pay to leave luggage but if they are not full, you can get a late check out for no extra cost.\r\nOverall, the hotel was very good and we would stay again.'
4,'Super !!','Un trés bon hôtel idéalement placé à NY . Pour notre 5ème séjour à New York nous avons choisi cet hôtel et franchement nous étions hyper satisfaits. Il est à 5 min à pieds de Penn Station, pour peu que vous arriviez de Newark avec l\'Airtrain, c\'est appréciable ! Macy\'s, Empire State Building , Madison Square Garden, tout est à proximité. On est aussi proche de Times Square tout en étant un peu plus dans la vraie vie new yorkaise ( c\'est à dire un tout petit peu moins de touristes que sur Times Square ...) l\'hôtel est propre, la literie trés confortable ... nous avions demandé par mail une chambre avec vue sur L\'Empire State Building, et nous avons en effet eu une superbe vue ! Le soir surtout c\'est magnifique. Point de vue isolation par contre c\'était moins bien, et puis les chambres à côté de la nôtre étaient chambres fumeur et je dois dire que parfois l\'odeur arrivait dans notre chambre. \r\nPour le petit déj vous avez juste à descendre à la réception à côté des ascenseurs, là ils vendent café, thé , chocolats, croissants, donuts ... bref tout ! \r\nAttenant à l\'hôtel vous avez aussi une institution de NY , le TIK TOK DINNER , qui reste ouvert 24/24 .\r\nBref, pour mon 6ème séjour, je retournerais trés certainement dans cet hôtel !'
5,'Historical Hotel in Downtown Chicago','We were immediately impressed when we entered the lobby. This historical hotel is very grand and beautiful inside. Lots of elaborate details in the lobby and Empire Room. The rooms themselves were very modern and updated so it didn\'t lack any modern conveniences. It is right next to shops and restaurants and a short walk to Millennium Park or Macy\'s. We got a fantastic price for a holiday weekend, it was worth every penny. We will definitely be going back here on our next stay in Chicago.'
3,'Plumbing problems ruined overall great stay','I\'d like to review this place first without our specific plumbing experience to give everyone a fair idea of what this place is like first. \r\nOverall its a really great hotel for the price. I went with a couple of friends and we had two beds, a nice TV, kitchen, a couple of nice chairs, coffee table and a nicely sized fridge. The location of the hotel is directly across from Madison Square Garden which was nice because we had come to see a basketball game there. Also, nothing was more than a quick subway or train ride away . We easily were able to travel to chelsea, brooklyn, times square, central park. \r\nThe service at the front was very nice and welcoming. I loved the overall feel of the hotel and the room. I would say, if I had to overlook our specific problem, It would have been a great experience, especially for the price we paid vs. other similar hotels in the area.\r\nNow on to our problem. At one point a friend of mine wanted to take a shower. She went to turn on the water and brown murky water proceeded to spray out of the faucet. We then turned on the sink, where we saw the same thing. \r\nImmediately we called down, and were told to just let the water run for 10-15 minutes and it should be fine. After 1.5 hours the water was still not clear. We called every so often and were just told to keep the water running. After 3 hours of waiting, and being continually told to just keep the water running, we decided to leave. We were out for for a couple of hours and made our way back only to find more of the same. Finally after multiple calls and hours of waiting they sent someone up to look at our water, where they fixed the water problem, but then discovered a leak in the sink.\r\nI hate to review the hotel based on this experience, but ultimately for us it lead to a good 4-5 hours we waited in the hotel that we could have been out in the city. All this being said, they did give us a credit and the front desk people were very apologetic. I really did want to like this place, and I feel like we got a one off bad experience, which takes my review from a 5 to a 3.'
4,'Very pleasant and right near 5th Avenue','This hotel is perfect if you want easy walking access to 5th and Madison Avenue. Central Park is about a 25 minute walk but pleasant. The staff were helpful. We stayed in a Lexington Suite which was costly and I must admit not worth it purely because you are given extra room including a lounge area but you do not use it, you spend so much time in the city you only go back there to wash and change. If you go in December ensure you wear thermals and gloves and scarfes as the wind makes it really really cold. The staff are lovely at the hotel and I would recommend it to anything. Right next to Grand Central but be warned if you want to go to Greenwich where the 9/11 site is ensure you get the tube (underground) not the train like we did and ended up in Greenwich (Conneticut) about 50 miles out of New York City.'
3,'No es tan malo como lo pintan','Relación calidad-precio le doy un 7 por que me pareció muy limpio, muy bien ubicado (a 20 segundos de times square). La única pega de mi habitación fué que los ascensores los tenía cerca y se oían, por lo demás, sin problema. La cama muy muy comoda.'
2,'ottima posizione ma....','Ho prenotato una camera per quattro persone su booking.com e nella conferma ricevuta da era indicata la presenza di due letti matrimoniali; in realtà abbiamo trovato due letti da una piazza e mezza! Inoltre la stanza (3905 - 39 piano) era molto piccola, sostanzialmente una stanza da due persone venduta al prezzo per 4 persone!!! ho segnalato allo staff della reception la situazione di scarso confort - anche tenendo conto della permanenza di 6 notti - ma nessuna soluzione è stata proposta!\r\nPremesso che l\'hotel vanta 4 stelle non ho trovato alcuni servizi utili, frigobar, connessione internet in camera, postazione internet gratuita nella hall (in europa ho sempre trovato almeno una postazione internet ad uso gratuito per i clienti dell\'hotel); la vasca del bagno evidentemente da cambiare e pulizia del bagno non al massimo. Molto rumoroso, non per il traffico, ma per rumori di compressori 0 similari in funzione fino a notte.\r\nIn generale ho trovato lo staff poco disponibile e poco cortese, non particolarmente attenti alla soddisfazione del cliente.\r\nIl prezzo pagato per la camera è stato alto e non comprendeva la colazione.'
1,'Do not stay here unless you are in a renovated room','Great entrance and location disappoints if you are unlucky enough not to have a renovated room. The bathroom was very small with peeling wallpaper and a dirty fan that didn\'t work. Bed was comfortable but room and TV was very dated, TV remote didn\'t work, couldn\'t open the disgustingly filthy window. One window was sealed with tape to keep out the draft. Air conditioning units didn\'t work so no way to circulate the air in the room which of course steamed up from the bathroom as it\'s fan wasn\'t working so damp pervades. You have to hope that your neighbours don\'t go to the bathroom in the middle of the night as you are sure to be disturbed. Kitchen very 1960\'s formica. Virgin rates this a 4 star in my view such a rating is totally unwarranted.'
5,'Been there twice, will be back!','Second time in NYC and second time in the New Yorker. Great location, Tick Tock diner\'s coffee is perfect (service is excellent too), Cooper\'s Tavern also excellent.\r\nService at the front desk was VERY friendly. Especially check-in was smooth. After a long day of travelling, my-new-best-friend Mohammed was awesome! I was tired and coming down with a flu, but Mohammed served us so well and with such friendlines, that I started to feel better. Amazing guy! Few minutes after we had checked-in and got up in our room, Mohammed called and asked is everything as it should be? It was: view to the ESB and the rest of the city was spectacular. (Tip: The higher you stay, better views you get, our room was in 38th)\r\nI can very well recommend this hotel to anyone and we\'ll be back again. Hopefully next summer...\r\nAlso I have to recommend the New Yorker Rides. We used there towncar-service to/from JFK-New Yorker for the second time. It\'s great to have a driver waiting for you in the airport and a private ride to the hotel. Believe me, it\'s worth the money! And it doesn\'t even cost that much.'
4,'bessere Lage geht nicht!!!','Die Lage ist wirklich super. Direkt am Times Square. Eine bessere Lage geht nicht!!! Viele weitere Sehenswürdigkeiten (Broadway, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, ...), zahlreiche Geschäfte und Essens-Möglichkeiten sind schnell zu Fuß zu erreichen. \r\nLeider waren die Zimmer bei unserer Ankunft (19 Uhr!) noch nicht fertig. Doch für diesen Wermutstropfen entschädigte uns die fantastische Aussicht! Die Zimmer waren gepflegt und geräumig. Die Preiskategorie ist sicherlich etwas gehoben. Vor allem das Frühstück im Hotel schlägt noch einmal richtig zu Buche, weshalb wir nur einmal dort gefrühstückt haben.'
5,'Location, Location, Location!!!!','I booked this hotel by a bidding third party website, and when the name was published, I was a bit concerned, as I immediately went to Tripadvisor to see the reviews. All my worrying was for nothing. The hotel was in the perfect location. Subway stops at the corner, drugstore, Starbucks next door, nice little deli next door, Time Warner mall across the street, 10 minute walk to Time\'s Square, 3 minute walk to Central Park. The room...I traveled with my 14 year old daughter, and 20 year old daughter, and had 2 double beds on the 23rd floor. We were not bothered by noise from the hotel. We had a nice view of 7th ave, and no noise from the windows. The bathroom wasn\'t spacious, but it wasn\'t teeny tiny. The girls had plenty of room to do their hair and makeup. The room itself was quite cute. It wasn\'t extremely spacious, but there was plenty of room for 4 suitcases, and the 3 of us to move around comfortably. The room was also extremely clean. I have stayed at numerous midpriced hotels in NYC, and this was one of the better ones so far. Far more roomy and clean for the same price as other hotels. The lobby was beautiful, as well as the garden area. The only down sides were the dark hallways, and at the Lobby Bar $14 for a glass of wine. The staff was friendly and helpful, and if you can over look the dark halls and bring your own wine, and keep in mind you are staying NYC, you will be quite happy with this hotel.'
4,'Buen Hotel , buena ubicación','El hotel esta muy bien ubicado , el tamaño de la habitación - para el standard de New York - es bueno . Rápido sistema de check in y out \r\nAlgunos detalles : Por que no tener WIFI como complemento? , no me parece razonable que en una ciudad como esta cobren por este servicio . Los ascensores no son los suficientes para el numero de habitaciones , por lo que en horas puntas este servicio puede ser muy lento'
4,'Immer wieder schoen','Diese Hotel gehoert zu meinen Lieblingshotels in NY. Zwar ist es nun auch schon in die Jahre gekommen, aber immernoch weit guenstiger als alles was man am Times Square findet, der auch garnicht soweit entfernt ist.\r\nDas New Yorker gehoert einfach zu New York. Es liegt gegenueber vom Madison Square Garden und bietet einen zentralen Punkt fuer alle Unternehmungen.\r\nDie Zimmer sind ordentlich und der Service sehr freundlich.\r\nMan kann wirklich gute Schnaeppchen machen, wenn man rechtzeitig plant und bucht.'
5,'Don\'t believe all you read','Hi - we stayed at the Park Central Hotel from the 20th to the 25th January 2007 - we were visiting NYC for the 1st time for our son\'s wedding - and couldn\'t complain about anything.\r\nA few little niggles - like the fan noise outside our 3rd floor window, a loose wire going into the wall - and noisy sheets (they actually gave off a small static flash if you looked in the dark when you moved around in them during the night) - but everything else was fine.\r\nBig room - two big beds, clean bathroom, plenty towels, room cleaned often, staff all friendly - no check in/out probs - even used the business centre to check-in our return flights on the internet - all great!!.\r\nHotel in ideal location - never far from anywhere. Almost next door to the NYC Tourist Board office ( and a great deli right next door to it - just LOVE homefries!!).\r\nWould return to this hotel in a heartbeat - EXCELLENT!!!!\r\nThanks to all at the Park Central'
5,'Great Location!','Great Location, walk out your door and you are right there in the middle of Times Square! It was great! Close to shows, restaurants, we had a blast! We also had a corner room which was huge! Didn\'t eat in the hotel, had a few drinks in the bar which was fine. Front Desk staff were helpful. The layout was a bit odd, you had to wait for a elevator to get to the lobby, then another elevator to get to your room. Not real issue though as there were so many that you didn\'t wait long. We had a great stay, can\'t wait to go back. Will try another Marriott property next time.'
4,'New Yorker in July','I booked this hotel through my local travel agent as the final stop on a three week visit to the New England area. It was recommended by a friend. We had two adjoining rooms. My three adult children had a bright airy room with two queen beds and a spacious bathroom. Our room next door was not as big, with a lovely view of a brick wall. However, in NYC one spends very little time in ones hotel room so that was not a problem. The hotel is nice, if a little dated, as I suppose can be expected in an Art Deco building. The reception staff were very good and a fine breakfast is available (extra) in the adjoining Tick Tock diner. The hotel is only a short stroll from Macy\'s , the Empire State Building and Times Square and is across the road from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Two rooms for four nights for five people cost me €2400, which is not cheap. Also, in my travels in the weeks previously I had become used to tea/coffee making facilities in the room. This was not available in the New Yorker. However, if I return to NYC in the near future I would consider staying there again.'
2,'Party hotel, not for sleeping','Impressive lobby (once you find the entrance, which is not hotel-like) and first look of the room is impressive (with see-through into the shower from the bed...), but the sleeping quality was pretty bad and the staff was not very helpful.\r\nWhen I arrived, I noticed that one of my lights couldn\'t be turned off. I called and said I wanted this fixed before I got back. After 5 hours, I got back and nothing had happened. I called again and said that I was tired and would very much like it fixed. 20 mins later I called again, and finally the engineers came up and unplugged the lamp (from beneath the bed). No excuses for this taking so long.\r\nThe hotel has three restaurants (at least) and one of the outdoor ones play party music which is heard into all rooms.\r\nThe view from the roof terrace is great, and both outdoor restaurants look very nice.\r\nThe concierge helped me to get discount Broadway tickets and seemed very knowledgable (ticket office opens at 3pm, these are nice shows etc). However, he failed to mention that on Sundays most shows only have matinee shows and thus start at 3pm with tickets being sold from 12pm. It was just pure coincidence that I could get a ticket at all!'
4,'Quite Happy','Booked into the Hudson for 2 weekends across August/September 2011. For the first weekend my flight into New York was cancelled due to hurricane Irene. The hotel was pretty helpful and had changed their cancellation policy to \'on-the-day\' which was considerate and welcome.\r\nWe did make it there for the 2nd weekend which was for a wedding. The hotel turned out to be a great place to stay for a social event like this due to the excellent different social areas - the bar, the nightclub, the garden where we could all meet. Some people did mention the small size of their room. We booked a slightly bigger size (I think it was a superior queen) and the room was fine. They do have about 8 different types of room and yes the basic one is very small, but if you want more room book a bigger option for a few bucks more. I thought the value still pretty good for New York City. I didn\'t think Hudson Hall was great for breakfast, a bit overpriced. There is however a pretty good typical diner 50 yards away where we went on the 2nd morning (Flame coffee house). The rooms are perhaps getting a little bit tired and our bed was quite noisey. Overall though I enjoyed the stay. Location is great for Central Park and shopping.'
4,'La mejor ubicacion... Para hacer turismo en NY','Realmente es una de la mejores ubicaciones de New York, a solo pocos pasos de times square, el edificio es viejo decorado artr deco tipico de la epoca de la ciudad, no cuenta con gran lujo, las habitaciones algo pequeñas igual que el baño, sin embago son comodas, existen hab remodeladas un poco mas modernas, tiene un buen precio para su ubicacion, realmente la mayor ventaja del hotel es su ubicacion. Saliendo del hotel hay un local de comida 24 horas Bien surtido y muy practico.'
3,'Pésimo olor a tabaco','Hemos pasado 3 días en este Hotel. Su localización es perfecta, muy cerca de Times Square y los teatros de Broadway. El Central Park está a tiro de piedra. Sin embargo, el día de nuestra llegada nos facilitaron una habitación que pertenecía a la antigua zona de fumadores. No es que la habitación oliera a tabaco, simplemente era irrespirable. Años y años de estar habitada por fumadores, han dejado un olor irrespirable y muy intenso. Al día siguiente nos cambiaron la habitación y estuvimos en una normal. Los empleados entienden el problema y tratan de solucionarlo. Parece mentira que un hotel tan bien situado no reforme el hotel y elimine habitaciones tan impresentables como la que nos adjudicaron al principio. En resumen: bien la ubicación, ojo a la habitación.'
4,'Westin Times Square -- Great Location without the hustle & bustle','We spent the long weekend in NYC and really enjoyed our stay at the Westin. This hotel is one block from Times Square on 43rd St & 8th Ave, so you don\'t get the same amount of foot traffic as to when you stay on Broadway or 7th Ave. This hotel is within walking distance of Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Theaters, and subway stations. Location is great if staying in the City and value being in the hub. \r\nAs for the hotel stay, we were taken care of from the minute we dropped our car at valet parking. This was really convenient unlike other Starwood properties near Times Square where you have to park yourself. Convenience is the key when traveling with family. The room was clean and the bed heavenly as promised. The hotel had a decent size room for NYC (Executive Club Floor) , plus it was recently renovated by an artist. We had one special request issue, but was taken care of and followed up by management. Not an issue, but thought I would mention that the hotel isn\'t perfect, but close to it. We are big fans and would stay there again.'
4,'Awesome Hotel','We loved the Palmer House Hilton. We stayed in room 258 and it was very nice. The hotel was in a great area. We did alot of walking but we pretty much walked every where. There is a great breakfast place on the corner from the hotel. A couple of doors down we got an awesome deep dish pizza. The pictures that you see of this hotel is exactly what you get. We also bid on our room and got it at a great price.'
4,'It was a good hotel for the price and experience for the Macys parade.','This hotel was good over all for the stay during the week of Thanksgiving. The room was small but I guess it was like all the other NY hotels. It was pretty clean, some staff was very nice and others well I guess ok. The hotel is near shops, restaurants and walking distance to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City, etc. It was nice and would stay there again.'
4,'This HOTEL delivers the NYC experience!','We started to create a family tradition this year by staying at in NYC and seeing Rockefeller Center, St Patrick\'s Catheral and other great holiday sights. Staying at the Marquis was a GREAT choice; room 3535 was the BEST...view of Times Square, all the best.\r\nValet parking at the hotel was seamless, check-in easy, room was ready when we arrived at 1:00pm. Although staying in NYC is very expensive the Marriott Marquis really delivered the entire experience!'
5,'Vacaciones de otoño!','Excelente ubicación, muy ordenado el check in y excelente atención de Ricardo ?lvarez, un señor. El hotel esta a pocas cuadras the Times Square, a tres del Central Park. Hay muchos restoranes cerca y claro, Starbucks por todos lados!'
5,'Crowne Plaza during Hurricane Sandy','We have just returned from a 4 night stay in New York and had a wonderful time only slighty marred by Hurricane Sandy. Almost everything was closed for 2/3 days attractions,shops ,resturants etc...But I have to say the places that did open with limited staff were amazing!!\r\nThe hotel staff were very hepful and professional and carried on as if Hurricane Sandy didn\'t exist, the only thing that affected us in the hotel was no hot water for the last 2 days but even then Vicky Martin (front desk) managed to get us a couple of jugs of hot water and brought them to our rooms herself!! We would definately return to the hotel.'
5,'Great Location. Great Hotel.','Roomy and comfortable. Great city views. Midtown location excellent for easy walks to many points of interest.'
4,'The location is its greatest asset','I stayed at the Hudson for two nights in January for a business meeting. It is directly across the street from Columbus Circle and very centrally located to everything on the island. The hotel has a few flaws, nothing at all insurmountable. First of all, it is dark, really dark everywhere, including the sitting areas in the lobby, the bathrooms, and the elevator. I need glasses to see anything in the dark so I always notice this. I would love it if all hotels had magnifying mirrors in the bathroom (hint to hotel managers everywhere). No coffee makers in the rooms and no free wireless. Their Cafeteria restaurant was in the process of remodeling (would have been nice to know before I booked) and will not be open until April, but as I said in the beginning, it is a great location. And very, very hip -- a beautiful hotel with clean, small rooms that are wonderful for one person. Better value can be found in the city but all things considered, it is a great place to stay.'
4,'Not bad at all!','I was actually pleasantly suprised by hotel Pennsylvania!\r\nI stayed here with my college group in March and after reading the other reviews on here and seeing pictures i was actually petrified about staying here!\r\nFirst off, this hotel is in an amazing location as it is directly opposite Madison Square Gardens and literally a 2 minute walk from Macy\'s and other shops. Time square is just a few blocks away too. \r\nIf you\'re looking for a luxurious and relaxing break then maybe this isn\'t for you, but in New York is there really need to stay cooped up in a hotel all day? There is so much to see so why spend lots on a room when your not there! OK, so it is all a bit dated but i would definately visit again. Our bathroom had a bath with shower which was very clean... apart from a few hairs on the corner of the bath... other classmates had rusty plugs but it was clean. Our room had 3 beds which were all fairly comfy! When we had adjusted to the time difference we slept fine. However, with the hotel being in such a good location all we could hear ALL night was taxi horns! \r\nSo overall, the hotel is FINE! I\'d much rather spend money shopping than on the best hotel! There were no cockroches, no rats, no cracks in the ceiling, no mould on the walls, no rust in our bath, and no coffin doors (as other people as referred to them). \r\nThe hotel lobby is very large and is probably the best part of the hotel. There are comfy leather seats too. There is 3 shops and a cafe too which are all reasonably priced... however, i suggest buying souvenirs from china town or somewhere cheaper... the hotel will charge $20 for a t-shirt but at china town you can get 3 for $10! One of the shop owners was very friendly and informative and really made us feel welcome in New York!\r\nTo the left of the hotel is Europacafe, this was great for breakfast as they had a huge selection of fresh food which they cook on order including bagels, pancakes, and oatmeal, and the staff in here are very friendly!\r\nI would reccommend ice skating at the rockefeller centre, this is great fun and really good to watch the more experiences skaters. This is really cheap too. I would also suggest a coach tour, we had an amazing tour guide which stopped off at different places over new york such as trump tower, the world trade centre site and central park. This gives you a great understanding of what you\'re actually seeing! For theatre students i would recommend visiting radio city hall; tour guides take you underneath the stage and show you the mechanical side of the moving stage area. \r\nAnd you must eat the four foods of new york!...pizza, cheescake, hotdogs, bagels!\r\nNew York is a truly AMAZING city! And when i go back, i would seriously consider staying in hotel pennsylvania again!'
1,'Stay elsewhere for the RSNA','Stay some place else. Our room was not cleaned two days in a row, despite our complaints. The room was cramped and the decor was hideous. The only advantage is that it was the first stop on our bus line, so we didn\'t have to wait in the cold for the RSNA bus.'
1,'Depends on what floor you are on','The pictures on this website do not lie. We were in room 1019 first, pictures on this website describe the horrible room. We called downstairs for refund but was given an option for a refurbished room. The refurbished room on floor 13, room 1327 was completely different. Fresh paint, newer furniture, newer carpet, painted clean friendly/safe looking door. We didn\'t have towels in the room. Even when the room was nicer, I still didn\'t feel comfortable after seeing the first room-rusted bath tub, tight worn 60 year old carpet, caving ceiling, unsafe gross door, SCARY hallways.. I was worried about bed bugs in both rooms.'
5,'Soggiorno sempre piacevole','Per la seconda volta in viaggio a New York e per la seconda volta al New Yorker che gia durante la prima esperienza nel 1999 (allora da sola in viaggio con mio figio di 6 anni) si era rivelato un ottima scelta. Ed anche questa volta da sola con mio marito la scelta si e rivelata felicissima. Posizionato splendidamente, tra il Madison Square Garden e l\'Empire State Building, vicinissimo a Times Square. Struttura imponente e camere pulite e ben arredate. Ed un punto a favore secondo me e anche la sua splendida insegna, visibile per altro in numerosi film di successo, che fa del New Yorker praticamente un simbolo di questa splendida e meravigliosa citta. innamorata di New York dunque ed anche del New Yorker. Consigliatissimo.'
3,'Updated, but Missed The Mark','This was right on the board-line of average and very good. The location is excellent for my work - just a few blocks from my office and an overall nice area. The bed was comfortable, but the AC didn\'t seem like it ever cooled the room, so despite the comfortable bed it was difficult to sleep. If you\'re looking for a business hotel, be warned that it doesn\'t have a traditional desk, but rather a table in front of a couch, so very difficult to do any work in the room. (The room overall is also quite tiny, but not much smaller than many other NY hotels.) \r\nThe bathroom is where they missed the mark. The bathroom is very small and cramped. Our room just had a shower, the sink was small and there was a counter over the sink so it was almost impossible to lean over to the sink without hitting your head on the counter. The toilet paper dispenser is behind you when on the toilet, the water came out of the sink when on high at a trickle, and the shower drain was constantly clogged and backing up. I was confused with why they made such a small bathroom when the closet was huge! \r\nThe lobby in this hotel, which can be a refuge, is just a big empty space with some chairs. I\'ve never seen such an unimpressive lobby area. The highlight of the hotel was the front desk staff, who were alway pleasant, happy and efficient.'
3,'Bonne situation géographique','Même, si cet hôtel est un peu défraîchi, peinture à refaire, il n\'en reste pas moins un établissement faisant partie de New-York.\r\nSon hall imense est néanmoins accueillant, le personnel est symphatique. La chambre était confortable, salle de bains un peu usagée mais propre. La situation géographique ce cet hôtel rend la découverte de la ville très facile, Penn station en face, Time Square cinq minutes à pied, la prise de bus up and down tout proche. Les nombreuses critiques négatives ne rendent pas une vision réélle de cet établissement'
3,'Poor start and finish, but generally fine','We arrived on May 27, \'we\' being myself, wife and son. We had booked through expedia, for a double room, noting that the hotel website states rollaway beds available for my son. I drew attention to this on the booking form. On arrival, a rollaway bed had not been put up, so my wife went to reception to request one. This developed into an argument with a male member of staff at reception, who stated that the hotel had no obligation to do so, and that our issue was with Expedia, not the hotel. This was upsetting after a long journey from UK and a transfer from JFK that in all took three and a half hours after landing. It was resolved only when a female supervisor intervened and quickly agreed to provide the bed.\r\nAfter that, the room was fine, with a comfortable bed/pillow and good sound insulation given the level of local street noise. We would have liked to use the internet facility but felt $15/day was too much for casual use. The concierge was helpful with local information. On three occasions during our six day stay, I saw two police officers in the hotel lobby, and wondered what the reason for this was.\r\nIt\'s a pity that our departure was also disappointing. I had asked at reception whether I should book a taxi for our intended departure time of 6pm, and was told that there was no need to do so as there would most likely be taxis waiting at that time. As it happened, we were ready to go a 5.25, but were all standing on the pavement/sidewalk until 6.05pm. The person that was hailing cabs said that we had been given poor advice, as that time of day was \'changeover\' and taxis were not likely to be standing idle, and had tried to tell reception about this in the past.'
3,'Dont worry about all you read','After reading all the reviews I was really worried about going to this hotel but it was part of a package and that was the deal for our party of 6. The check in queue was long but is is a huge hotel and depends on the time of day you arrive - but the man on the desk was helpful to us. The foyer was impressive and we were given 3 rooms on 9th floor. Yes when you came out of the lift the corridors looked shabby and we were worried about the rooms. They were a bit dingy with a drab carpet but the bed was clean,large, very comfortable, fresh towels were in the bathroom and the bathroom was clean. The room was cleaned every day with fresh sheets on the bed and plenty fresh towels. The shower was powerful and no problems with temperature. We had to call for a light bulb and a hairdryer for the room but the request was dealt with immediately. There was only one member of staff who was rude - one of the Bell Captains as one of our party had lost luggage to be delivered to the hotel and he was most unhelpful,but apart from him all others were polite and courteous..The room was noisy at night but you are in the middle of New York and anyway we were always too tired to hear any noise!! We used the computer room at a small charge and although it was busy you can easily get access. We were able to leave our luggage after check out for a small charge of 4 dollars until we collected it at 5pm and a special mention to the left luggage member of staff who was cheerful and very helpful. So in summary great location, yes the decor is shabby but we had no problem with the cleanliness which is really all that matters'
5,'The Best staff ever!!','This is our second year in a row staying at the Affinia Manhattan for Fashion Week. The location is great, the room offerings are exactly what we need for this type of business trip and the amenities at the hotel are ideal for us. \r\nThat said, the number one reason we return to the Affinia Manhattan is because of the Bell Captain Carl! He has always treated us like family and he takes care of the countless moving and shipping we needs for our shows. We could not do these trips without Carl and we have never had such attentive service from any other hotel - ever!'
3,'Girls Weekend','The New Yorker hotel rooms suited the 5 of us fine. The standard rooms were adequate for our 3 night stay,one of our rooms was a little larger with 2 armchairs and a table hence it became the party room! All had views, 1 of the Empire State building,2 of the coastline.They had all been refurbished and the beds were really comfy.The absolutely favourite thing was the Tick Tock Diner located at ground level of the hotel., huge portions typical diner food and ambience, try the disco fries, the pancakes, all of them!!! burgers to die for, endless coffee, and so long as you understand the U S tipping system the staff are great. The hotel is well placed for shopping...... Macys less than 5 minutes walk, unless you pop into D S W on the way....... 3 floors of bargain shoes A 7 dollar cab ride to Central Park 11 dollars to Bloomingdales. Get the bus to Woodbury Common outlet mall 1 hour away, for 42 dollars each....designer shopping heaven.Go see War Horse at the Lincoln Centre. If you have trouble fitting into the time difference at night buy some Advil P M from Duane Reade over the road'
2,'couldn\'t stay the night','My husband and I were so disappointed in this hotel. It was booked for him for a business meeting. The room looked like it hadn\'t been vacuumed in a few years. Large room but one small double bed. The bathroom was tiny, a with rotted wood vanity and a peeling mirror. Had trouble getting help unloading bags-- two bellmen stood there with their eyes averted until I requested help. We checked out immediately and spent the night at another hotel.'
4,'Beautiful looking hotel','The view of the hotel from the reception level is stunning and your really can\'t beat the location. \r\nMy room was surprisingly quiet considering Times Square was just floors below me and the room was clean at all times. The fitness center is very good for a hotel. The staff were attentive and well organized.\r\nMy only real gripe with this hotel is that the washroom did not seem as well cared for as the rest of the hotel. The vent was not functioning and looked slightly dated. \r\nHowever, my experience of this hotel was positive.'
4,'had a great stay at Hilton.','Was a very pleasant stay. Some reviews had me concerned, but quite honestly, the room and service was very good, the price was good, the amenities were good, and I didn\'t experience any rude, unfriendly employees. I was really blown away by how some of the reviews were so much different than I experienced. Guess their are people who expect more than I do, but I was treated very well. The room wasn\'t a remodeled one and had some age, but was very well kept. Couldn\'t ask for more than I got out of a 3-4 star hotel in NYC. Convient, clean, loved the Executive Club and for my family, saved us $30-40 a day in breakfast. Huge selection of muffins, crossiants, fresh fruit, cereals, juices, bagels, etc. Rated the stay an A.'
2,'worst hotel I have stayed in','PROBABLY THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED IN. great location but the hotel rooms are filthy the heating unit was rusty and falling to bits, when we opened the panel to the controls it was filled with dust.dust and rubbish behind all the furniture.black mould around the top of the sink,rust in the bath. I could go on and on. we asked for a change of room but the second was only marginaly better. everyting was grubby corridors smelly.\r\nPart of our deal was complimentary breakfast and tickets to the statue of liberty,they were not ofered and we had to ask for them, we got the breakfast vouchers but the statue of liberty tickets were not available , we were asked to come back for them the folowing morning. which we did and were given tickets which we found out later were worthless because the statue was close due to the storms and they were out of date. when I complained I was told they did not know. this was 3 weeks after the storm!!!!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED'
4,'Perfect spot to explore the Big Apple','We arrived on Columbus weekend so it was a little hectic, but staff were friendly and helpful. We booked a wheelchair accessible room (full roll-in shower) and the room was perfect for my partner\'s needs. The bed was a small queen so I ended up sleeping on a pull-out. The hotel and room were decorated in beautiful art deco style, our room was a spacious corner room with views of the Chrysler building. The negatives to staying here were that it took at least half an hour for staff to arrive if you requested anything (blankets etc) and front desk staff were not so friendly (all other staff were great). A real disappointment for disabled travelers is that the Tick Tock Diner is not wheelchair accessible! It is only a couple of steps and a ramp could easily be accommodated from the hotel lobby entrance. Positives are that it was good value for money, we found the location to be central and all attractions easily accessed, room and hotel decor is lovely and generally ver friendly staff. We really enjoyed our stay.'
3,'Crammed room...Is it Hyatt?','The check in was efficient but entering in the room I had a shock. It was more like a \'Inn\' rather than Hyatt. Small, practically windowless, noisy aircon and tiny bath. There was hardly enough space to move around and open the suitcases properly. The room service was pathetic and took at least a reminder and half an hour for anything that I ordered. The basic aminities was also not replenished every day like shampoo and soaps.\r\nI would not reccomend anyone to stay here....if they have a choice.'
4,'Great location, but very busy ambiance.','Knew this Hilton would be a good location, halfway between Times Square and Central Park and right next to Rockefeller Plaza, but didn\'t realize how large the hotel feels and how busy it is. If you want a quaint, boutique feel, go elsewhere. Prices seem all over the map as my colleague booked a room just a few days after I did and payed $120 more per night. Still like accumulating my points as a diamond honors member and the rooms are good size for NYC, but I might look elsewhere next time when traveling on business. Very nice gym if you don\'t feel that all the walking is enough...'
4,'Good value for money','The place is phenomenal, with very nice view on time square.\r\nThe hotel itself is huge and pretty nice.\r\nRooms are large but not super modern.\r\nService is average at best...with people nearly begging for tips.\r\nThe parking in the hotel is expensive but very convenient!\r\nThe restaurant on the top has amazing view'
4,'Great Hotel!','We stayed at the Hudson Hotel for 5 nights and after reading a lot of bad reviews was very pleased with the hotel. Rooms were very clean and although small, bigger than I was expecting. Perfect location within walking distance to Times Square and 5th Avenue. \r\nHad a great stay here and would definately reccommend it!!!'
5,'Classy and historic','Stayed four nights for business week of July 9th. Arrived at about 10:30 AM and my room was ready, very encouraging. On the 18th floor, got a very good location around the bend from the floor lobby. Room itself faced the back of the building so no view at all and was slightly larger than a cruise ship cabin, but it used all of the available space much better than much larger rooms I\'ve stayed in elsewhere. Although the hotel has been around seemingly forever, the room looked to be recently renovated with updated furniture and bathroom fixtures. Tremendous housekeeping too, one of the best! Asked for extra towels and got enough to cover half of the city, very much appreciated. Each day the room was cleaned spotless, can\'t ask for more. Lobby and surrounding areas reek with history. Great touch are pictures of the numerous famous performers who played their Empire Room over the years. Classy in all respects. The only detraction was that cell phone service was awful in the room - continually dropping calls so I had to go out into the street to connect. Desk staff courteous and check-out email of the bill delivered as promised (as well as under the door). Got a great room rate and didn\'t have a car so that cost was of no concern to me. Excellent location, walking distances to many great restaurants and venues. Although the hotel has a restaurant and lounge, ask the front desk or concierge for a listing of restaurants nearby. A very enjoyable pleasant stay and would return again.'
4,'Great midtown location','The central location really makes this nice, though in a very touristy part of the city. The rooms are nice and on par with what one would expect from a Hilton.'
5,'Stunning views from 26th floor.','I have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan six times now and this time I treated myself to a suite on the 26th floor. Firstly, the views were amazing, the Empire State Building on one side and Downtown Manhattan on the other. The suite itself was bigger than my first apartment - a living room with two settees, an office area and a TV. Also, a fully equipped kitchen, a bedroom with a bed that could have slept four and another TV, a good sized bathroom (large shower) and two closets. For the price you won\'t get anything better in Manhattan, and a great location too.'
4,'Great hotel, great staff','We are a family of four, mam, dad and two young children, who spent the New Year in New York. We fund out about the AFFINIA MANHATTAN in tourism website for NYC and are we glad we stayed there! \r\nFirst of all it\'s opposite Madison Square Gardens and walking distance from Times Square and the subway. Secondly, the staff couldn\'t do enough for us ie: booking broadway shows, sightseeing tours, general info.\r\nOne of our kids is intellectually disabled incidentally and the hotel were very understanding. We had a two bed studio with basic kitchen facilities on the 9th floor and it was spotlessly clean. Our advice, stay there - you wont regret it.'
4,'Sfarzose atmosfere retro','Non si può lasciare Chicago senza aver trascorso almeno una notte al PALMER House Hilton. La meticolosa ristrutturazione ha lasciato intatta l\'atmosfera sfarzosa che questo Hotel storico doveva avere agli inizi del secolo scorso, nella Chicago del proibizionismo resa celebre dai numerosi film che vi sono stati ambientati: grandi hall con ori e soffitti affrescati; scaloni sfrazosi che conducono a innumerevoli sale di varia ampiezza attrezzate per incontri, congressi, convegni e party. Le camere standard sono piuttosto piccole, ed il bagno angusto per un hotel di questo standing: ma se vorrete concedervi qualche lusso in più, con poca differenza potrete prenotare una comoda e confortevole suite (vi sono varie combinazioni interessanti, prenotando in anticipo). Personale molto cortese e disponibile; posizione straordinaria per raggiungere a piedi i principali luoghi di interesse ed il centro degli affari, sia il Millenium Park dove passeggiare nel verde lungo il lago Michigan. È inaccettabile il fatto di dover pagare un extra per avere il collegamento internet in camera, ma sappiamo che l\'America é il paese in cui si paga anche l\'aria che si respira. Prezzo ragionevole in rapporto alla qualità del servizio.\r\nProvato nel novembre 2010 e riconfermato nell\'ottobre 2012.'
3,'Poor service. Zero respect for customer','On arrival we were accused of not had paying the room fee when on booking 6 months prior, credit card details were taken and the booking was confirmed. We then got locked out of the room and escorted to and from the lobby by security. There was absolutely no respect given to us as customers and patrons and we were left feeling like criminals. When the money situation was resolved no apology was acknowledged and we did not have a comfortable stay. For the amount we paid we recieved a room that was on the smallest scale and will not be returning or recommending the Hudson Hotel.'
3,'Muy buena ubicacion','en relacion precio calidad , es bueno no esperes lujo, pero vale la ubicacion, es espectacular, no tiene mas servicios que la habitacion , tv, agua caliente, como lujo podes encontrar un cecador de cabello y toallas limpias . La internet solamente en el haal y es paga , pero si tienes nootebboock te hacercas a una ventana y tienes internet gratis de tiendas mercy . no tiene caja de seguridAD ni cordialidad de parte de los empleados. Pero para recuperar fuerzas y dormir para seguir cAMINANDO es bueno'
2,'A nightmare','In March we have been in the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York for 7 days. \r\nTwo friends stayed in a normal bedroom close to the elevator and I stayed with another friend in a room in the back corridor. Before my friend arrival I went to a really awfull room that was dark and undone. I changed immediatly to the other one.\r\nDuring the first days it was not excellent, but ok. The bathroom was white and clean. After that, one night I found a cockroach coming from the door. The day after that I was taking a shower and there was another one dead (sleeping instead because at night she woke up) over my towel. Can you imagine how did I scream?? Put more volume when at night I had to kill the one of the towel who was making a tour in my shower, immediatly I saw other in the basin and other on the floor getting to my friends luggage. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\r\nI thought it could be something of my mind (I see a lot of movies) but my friend saw it too, so...\r\nIt was a real nightmare.\r\nFinnaly they changed us to the upper and bigger room and we were safe. \r\nThe Hotel seems like a metro station...fuuuuuuulll of people and a mess, cause you don\'t know who to talk with when need help, cause you need always to follow a queue to reception. \r\nI would just indicate that hotel if you know what bedroom you are taking and if you need a good location. The location is really good!\r\nFor the rest, not at all.'
4,'Wonderful stay with 2 little ones - great location','Double / Double room prefect for two nights in Big Apple with two little kids for Christmas shopping, skating, and sight seeing excursion.\r\nRoom was spotless, and housekeeping did a great job keeping up with our mess.\r\nFront desk staff was highly efficient.\r\nBeing from the sticks in the Midwest we loved the relative hipness of the place.\r\nThe location is perfect for visiting the Central Park South area, and was a easy walk to Rockefeller and Times Square.\r\nThis is an ancient building (old hallways), but the Morgans Group has done a great job with the place.'
3,'Better for Business Travel','While a very nice facility, I found the Westin disappointing on so many levels. The room is very modern, too much so for my comfort level. The dark tile leading to the closet and bathroom is so cold. The large bedside lamps were mirror silver and kind of disconcerting to me. My husband was doing business and liked the long desk area with easy access to power and a nice desk chair. But the TV is on it as well, so you have to face sideways to watch the TV. We had a nice corner room as shown in their photos, but most rooms have fewer windows of course.\r\nMy least favorite thing was the bathroom! The noisiest toilets ever made. Terrible. We could hear them even from another room when they flushed. And there is a sliding door with frosted glass. What a terrible idea, it\'s not convenient to use a slider, plus when my husband went in there early in the morning, the light flooded the room through the glass. I agree the water pressure was weak, and in fact I had to turn it all the way to HOT to get it warm enough to shower.\r\nI don\'t know what that picture they have of the front entry to the hotel is about. The entry is extremely unassuming into a small security lobby, and you have to ride up a long escalator to get to the lobby and front desk, etc. I can\'t believe that doesn\'t bother people; it\'s very --well, not grand.\r\nThat said, the location is great for anywhere you want to go in the city. And the front desk people were nice. I need to ask the concierge something, but when I called from the room, I couldn\'t get through; they were always busy. Oh and maybe it\'s just me, but I was irritated that they charge $10 to use the fitness facility. For these prices, they should include it.'
4,Good,'my family and I spent Christmas week in the city and stayed in several hotels while there. Crowne Plaza was my husband\'s favorite hotel of the week. The hotel itself is lovely and was festively decorated. The staff did NOT go out of their way to make any good impression in any way. A few times some even seemed like they were inconvienced. It\'s so hard to find good service anymore... \r\nI got a great rate on hotwire.com. The location was unbeatable. I would stay here again.'
2,'Poor, poor, poor','We stayed here 5 years ago. However things have changed. Do not stay here! \r\nThis is why: \r\nWe arrived jet lagged and were booked in easily and professionally. However, on arrival to our room, next door were getting ready and there were allot of young people around very noisy, so we asked to change rooms. This was done fairly quickly. We arrived in our new room (double, on check-in we were told there were no doubles available) the draws were broken, the bath enamel worn away and the sink consol chipped (bare in mind this hotel has been recently refurbished) we were tired and were not planning to spend much time in the room so stayed put. At around 1am a party arrived next door. Again we were in a connecting room. Very noisy so did not get any sleep. The same happened the next night, so had to move rooms again (you would have thought the hotel would have told them to be quiet) Third time lucky we specifically asked for a non connecting room and this was much better (although the draws were still chipped and we had no small mirror or room info book in this one!). Cannot comment on the restaurant or other services as we did not use them. Overall I would say unless you are in New York to party till late with the best of them and don’t mind shabby fixtures & fittings, (hotel is not well looked after at all) you\'ll be fine here - If you want value, respect and a good nights sleep.... really believe me.... don’t stay here! We wish we hadn’t!! oh ps its true about the lift - almost every time we got bashed by the doors! Oh and read the small print before you order room service......... costs a fortune! Glad we never did! Some reviews I think, gosh all these people must be so picky as we had a great time! NOT HERE! I cannot stress enough – book someplace else!'
1,'pit of despair','This hotel has one thing going for it, it is across from Madison Square Garden. Not sure where to start with the negatives... I guess check-in:\r\nHuge line, which is understandable since we were there for the dog show. But, once we finally reached the counter our room was not available, we\'d need to wait in the line again to check in... want to leave your luggage with them? $4 a bag!!!! Oy!\r\nOnce we finally got our room, it was tiny and really gross:\r\nDirty carpets\r\nDust basically everywhere, if you open the historic valet doors, you will find enough dust to clog any vacuum cleaner.\r\nFurniture was basically falling apart\r\nHeat either pumped out too much hot air, or was freezing, with basically no way to control the temp.\r\nOutlets were incredibly loose and often your electronics just fell out of them.\r\nTerrible pillows with no extras available.\r\nThe walls were paper thin.\r\nIce machine was not working on our floor.\r\nOk on to the bathroom:\r\nYuck!!!! Mold everywhere!\r\nPeeling paint and huge holes in the walls\r\nHuge stains on the marble\r\nshower was at about chin level and was so forceful it actually hurt to use it\r\nThe wind from the forceful shower pulled the curtain in to the shower area so it stuck to you while bathing. This also lead to a huge amount of water on the floor of the bathroom.\r\nThe temp was impossible to control and often would scald you.\r\nThe tub stopper was not connected to the chain, so impossible to empty the tub. We figured that housekeeping would help with this issue, but nope, returned to find a tub filled with the same water... Had to jam a hanger in there to unstop! \r\nBasically it was nice to be able to walk to the dog show and hang with pups in the lobby. Everything else was awful!'
1,'Disgusting cess pool','On arrival from London the last thing I needed was to queue for an hour to check in. I was worried by the sign in reception that noted Portable smoke alarms to hire - a 1700 room hotel with no smoke alarm system? Are they mad?\r\nWalking to my room I was again worried, the corridor had clearly not been cleaned in months and months, each room door looked like the door of a crack house. It felt like a bad bad place.\r\nThe first room I was given stank of cats urine, had clearly not seen a vacuum cleaner in months and had sagging stinking beds, windows that wouldn\'t close, air con spewing out filth, sticky carpets, filthy bathroom - it was hard not to burst into tears.\r\nSecond room lacked the cats urine smell but otherwise the same as the first - uninhabitable.\r\nThirdly, a corporate room. No smell, cleanish looking beds - by this time I\'d been shunted around for 3 hours and at 5am on my body clock I had to crash out.\r\nI slept in my clothes and took a shower in my flipflops to avoid having to touch the surface of the bath.\r\nNone of the rooms have safes! \r\nI checked out at 6am and moved to the wonderful (and similarly priced) Westin on 43rd.\r\nDo NOT stay at this hotel - a vile, disusting cess pool that is not fit for animals let alone humans.'
5,'Wonderful surprise!','I normally run from huge tourist hotels since they tend to be mainly worn-at-the-heels, poor-service factories that operate on the knowledge they\'ll get the traffic no matter what. For several reasons, this was my only option for a 4-day business trip. What a great unexpected place. The renovations, which appear to be very recent, are well done and clever: nice touches like four plugs on the (very user-friendly) desk to charge everything at once, full-length under-counter night-light in the bathroom, huge in-room safe, bedside lamp sconces with small halogen reading lights attached. Bedside clock with iPod holder that was simple to use (something not to common these days at hotels). One thing that always annoys me are renovated hotels that do nothing with old 1960s slab doors; the room doors here were either new or well-refurbished. A small point but a quality one. The entire room was spotless. In fact, the hotel halls and common areas were spotless: many NYC hotels leave room service trays or carts in the halls for hours. Saw nothing here. Clean, fresh smelling, fully-functioning spaces. And a simply fabulous bed. I\'m starting to miss it.\r\nThe staff were attentive, responsive and friendly. My tv remote wasn\'t working upon check-in and it was replaced right away. The maid noticed that I was using the coffee maker alot and left extra sugar/creamer. I asked for a higher floor at check-in and got exactly what I wanted. There\'s clearly a management push to be service-oriented and they\'re hiring the right people. \r\nThere are some negatives. What can\'t be overcome is the sea of tourists in the lobby but once you\'re past that and on the guest floors, you really don\'t know it\'s Times Square. The elevators can be awfully crowded but again, not much that can be done about that since there are at least a dozen in operation. Two items that can be fixed, however: There\'s no makeup mirror in the bathroom which, for us female business travelers, is a necessity. And the room service menu is ridiculously high-priced. If the hotel\'s trying to maintain room service business with so many restaurant options within a block, including Junior\'s just out the door, it needs to be more competitive. I normally order continental breakfast - coffee and bagel - so I can do work in the early morning while on the road but my normally-reasonable employer\'s accounting dept would\'ve had a fit if it had cost me around $35 each day to do so. I opted to run out for food and come back. I\'m in NY on business often at various hotels and know what room service ordinarily costs, but this was out of line.\r\nThose few gripes aside, this is one great hotel. I will definitely return and will highly recommend this hotel to others. In fact, been back two days and already did.'
5,'Wonderful Experience','It was worth every penny. We had a great time. Love the small size desserts. That way I didn\'t feel too guilty'
4,'Tolles Stadthotel','Ideal mitten in Manhattan liegendes Hotel mit drei Sterne Status, den es auch verdient.\r\nU-Bahnstation direkt vor dem Hotel, Empire State Building, Times Square etc. in angenehmer Laufdistanz. Sehr netter, bemühter Service. Für New York übliche kleine Zimmer, aber sehr sauber und komplett modernisiert.\r\nZum Hotel gehöriger Diner in dem nicht nur Touristen frühstücken ist wirklich sehr empfehlenswert.'
5,'A gem of a property in the heart of NYC!','We LOVE the Westin New York because of the wonderful people who make us feel so at home here.  Luis welcomed us at check-in and was incredibly gracious.  And it is always great to see Soo Lee, the Atrium Club manager who welcomes us back so warmly.  Miguel, the rooms manager handled our reservation and everything was perfect when we arrived.  The staff at the Westin does so much to make our stay in NYC so pleasant that it\'s our first choice property when we\'re here.'
4,'Renovated Rooms are Very Nice-- What an improvement','I had last stayed at the New York Hilton in late September 2006 when they had their linen fire. I was very pleasantly suprised at their newly renovated rooms that at this point appear to be given namely to Hilton Gold or Plat members ( I am gold) -- much nicer than the old rooms. Staff was very nice, except for a woman that would not let a friend of mine connect to the free internet on the 44th floor in their Executive lounge, that we had done on Saturday. Location, Location, Location is really the big advantage to the New York Hilton.'
2,'overpriced, grotty at the edges and rude staff','Brilliant location and terrible hotel. Vastly overpriced. Our first room was small - there were pringles all over the carpet behind the telly, the bathroom door didn\'t close and there was thick dust on the carpets all round the edges of the furniture. We were moved to a slightly bigger room and this time the bathroom door closed but the hot tap in the sink was jammed solid and the bedside table has a greasy film. The fridge leaked so the carpet was wet. When I mentioned this at reception I was told the room shouldn\'t have a fridge and why was I mentioning my disappopintment after I had already slept in the room for a night - unbelievable! no eye contact from reception staff, let alone a smile - very rude. UK travellers who are used to Premier Inn and Travelodge will be shocked at poor standards and high price. Wouldn\'t stay here again - ever!'
1,'Una pesadilla de hotel..El hotel del terror...me quede sin palabras...que asco de hotel.','Cuando reserve por Internet la foto de las habitaciones no se parecen a la real, las habitaciones son viejas, hay humedad en los techos, los inodoros y la decoración parecen del siglo 15, las atenciones horribles, una hora después de estar ahí me empezó una alergia, cuando chequie las cortinas llenas de polvo, las tuallas curtidas...este hotel lo único bueno es la ubicación, pero preferiria dormir al interperie que amanecer una sola noche,,,,deberían clausurarlo...que pena y vergüenza ajena me dio ver que en pleno midtown exista tanta insalubridad.....a la hora decidimos irnos, conseguimos en crowned plaza , que para nuestra tranquilidad si resulto un buen hotel.....vengo de republica dominicana y en mi país el hotelucho mas corriente esta en mejores condiciones que este.....que pesadilla!!!!! Que si recomendaría este hotel...!ni a mi peor enemigo!!!!'
2,Disappointed,'I said at the Westin a few weeks ago. I was very disappointed by the service. Things listed on the website where not offered when I arrived. Lights were broken, no one ever came to fix them. I had previously booked another hotel and changed to the Westin, I should have stayed with the other. I am returning to NY in just a few weeks and Westin will not be my choice of hotel this time. Expected more with the hotel.'
3,'HIlton a Good choice, but I think there are better out there','Trip Overview: Took my mother to NY for her first time as a Mother\'s Day Gift. We stayed in New York for a long weekend June 9-12 at the Hilton New York. \r\nHotel Selection: I am an Honors Gold member so we wanted to use points for our stay. We did not want to stay in Times Square (and once we got to NY, I was happy we didn\'t!). The Milennium Hilton, while it looked like a gorgeous hotel, was just too far out of the way from the things that we wanted to do. So, that left us with the Hilton NY. I had stayed in this area of NY before and enojoyed it so we gave the hotel a shot. This hotel is a nice place. Big lobby and a couple of bar areas. Taxis always waiting outside. This hotel seemed to be mainly used for business people/conventions and lacked any kind of unique or special feel. Also, due to the size of the hotel, elevator time was sometimes a problem. \r\nUpon arrival, we checked in at the Honors Desk and were upgraded to an Executive Room on the 35th Floor. Unless you really want the free continental breakfast, I think spending extra $$ on the Executive Room would be a rip-off! We entered the room and I could tell that it had not been updated. The room appeared dark and the bathroom was not very clean. I called the concierge and asked to be moved. She said someone would be right up to pick up our bags and move us to a remodeled room, but that we would still get the executive floor breakfast priveleges. After 20 minutes, no one came to get our bags so I went downstairs to get the new key for myself. We were moved to the 32nd floor into a remodeled room. It actually appeared to be a bit bigger and felt a lot lighter and cheerier. The modern TV area was much nicer. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms, but our 2nd room\'s bathroom did appear cleaner. \r\nPros: Comfortable room and very comfortable bed and linens\r\nNice desk workspace and sitting area\r\nCool flat screen TV and wireless internet\r\nNeat MP3/Alarm clock deal\r\nAbundance of cabs outside\r\nLocation is very good! Close to subway stops, Central Park and Times Square without being in the middle of a really loud area.\r\nWindows open so you can let the cool breeze in\r\nCons: Remote and wireless access to the TV appeared to lag a bit.\r\nBathroom could be more updated and modern to fit with the rest of the room\r\nConcierge service was rude and not helpful. There are some good books and maps to help you out at the concierge desk that you can take for free.\r\nIn general, service was extremely slow. I found it easier to just do things for myself.\r\nBig hotel that lacks the charm of a smaller place\r\nElevators sometimes slow\r\nConclusion: A good comfortable and clean hotel, but definitely not a good value. It was fine for us since I used points, but the rate would have been about $500/nt (including tax). I think that is way too expensive, even by NY standards, for this hotel. I definitely think there are better values out there.\r\nOther Tips: The Top of the Rock which is located nearby at Rockefeller Center has one of the best views of the city. Although I have been to NY several times, I had never even heard of this. Got some great pictures from up there and I thought the view was better than from the Empire State Building and also NO LINE!\r\nCheck out the Meatpacking District for some great places to eat and socialize. Seemed to be a pretty trendy, up and coming area.\r\nRide the subway! Although the hotel is very centrally located, explore other parts of the city. Using the subway was not very difficult and we found New Yorkers to be very friendly and helpful.'
1,'HORRIBLE and DISGUSTING!!!!!!!','Stayed at this hotel because of great location and good pricing but given a chance I would take it back!! From the lobby the hotel looks pretty decent and it\'s very busy which makes it seem like a good quality but the corridors are dark and dirty! The rooms are an issue in its self. The bathroom is small and dirty! There was mold on the ceiling and cracks in the wall. The carpet was old and dirty!! The bed was hard and flat!! And to top it all off there were BED BUGS!!!!!! We found ourselves walking two blocks to the Radisson Martinique on 32nd at 2am with three kids!! This hotel was very nice, clean, cool, and had great location and great pricing. Wish i would have booked this one from the get go!! The Hotel Pennsylvania is definitely not worth the money!!! It made for a Horrible, horrible experience for my first time in NYC!!!!!!!'
5,'Super Beds','Very well placed for doing all we wanted, sightseeing, theatre, restaurants. The staff were very helpful especially as we were checking out to go to a wedding for one night and then returning to the same room. The room was well equipped and the beds were FANTASTIC. You know how we normally say can\'t wait to get back to my own bed at home, this was not the case here.We didn\'t eat in the hotel, rather pricey, but we wanted to get out into the buzz of the city and there were plenty of eating places. Some didn\'t look that good but the service and food was always a pleasant surprise.\r\nHelicopter ride around Statue of Lib was great, open top bus ride beset with problems, bus breaking down. Would choose a cooler time of year next time.'
4,'Great location, good value for money','Perfectly located accross from the MoMa and 2 blocks away from Central Park. Big and busy hotel, sometimes can get crowded, therefore does not offer the best service always. But certainly above a certain standard in everything. Rooms are good sized (enough for a family of 4), but could do with a facelift especially in the bathroom.'
5,'Solid 5 Stars!','I spent 2 nights here early Oct. It was FANTASTIC! Emailed the hotel prior of our arrival about our special occasion. Ms. Caren Heller was able to pre-arrange for me. I was VERY impressed with her work. BIG Kudos to Ms Caren Heller. \r\nThe hotel staffs are generally friendly. Except the executive lounge attendant. He was cold with bad attitude. He did not offer drink. We dined at the hotel restaurant, had a few drinks and snack at the hotel lobby bar/lounge, used the gym, and spent some money at gift shop. \r\nI really love the bar lounge location at the lobby area. It plays hit music, and the atmosphere is awesome. Not to mention the great view from Times Square. I was really impressed with the server at the lobby bar. Didn\'t get her name but she worked there by herself with a bartender. She was very efficient. She served us drink and food in timely manner. The lobby is pretty decent size. She works the whole lobby all by herself.\r\nThe hotel is situated right in Times Square. Most tourist places are within walkin distance or short subway hop. The hotel is in very nice conditions. Highly recommended place to stay when you visit Times Square area.'
4,'Fantastic location; I\'ve included directions for check in','You will not find a better location for tourist area/Times Square in NYC. Theaters surround the property along with several surprisingly affordable restaurants (highly recommend John\'s Pizzeria). Also, the subway is only a couple of blocks away. Check in and elevators are tricky, but really convenient once figured out. To check in proceed to the 8th floor. You will see a panel on the wall at ground level elevators, enter 08 into the panel and it will give you a letter; you will see numerous elevators and each is labeled with a letter, simply go to the elevator the panel indicates and it will arrive very shortly. We asked for a room facing TS, but were advised those rooms were $100 additional so we declined; however, our side room still had a fantastic view over most of TS that we really enjoyed. We got a very good rate off Marriott website (came out to $400 a night tax and all). If I were to pay more than this I am not sure I would rate it so high. I recommend ONE drink at the bar at the top of the restaurant just to see the view.'
4,'Fantastic location, great onsite facilities, very comfortable','I booked this hotel online despite some negative reviews and was very pleased that I did. The entire booking process was very quick and efficient. I arrived late at night and was greeted very well and was made to fee comfortable by the staff. My room was shockingly tiny and had no view except of other sections of the hotel. This being said the bed was extremely comfortable and the room had all necessary amenities. The bathroom showed its age despite efforts to upgrade it and the in room amenities were very limited.\r\nThe location of this property is FANTASTIC you have everything you could possibly need within walking distance of the hotel - Macy\'s, Cinema\'s, Restaurants, Shops etc. The onsite Diner was excellent value and offered a wide menu choice.\r\nI would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants to see New York.'
4,'Great location and accomodating!','Great stay at a good hotel! Instantly upgraded by Mohammed (great travel agent added celebration to booking form!) room was good size for 2 adults and child! view of Empire state building all be it from a small corner window. No tea making facilities in the room but great coffee bar in reception and you can take them to your room. Didnt eat in the Tick Tock Diner, but it was open 24/7. Right across from Penn Station, so great subway access!\r\nHelpful front desk checked opening times for us! Generally clean and good service would revisit and recommend!'

2,'Dog Hotel','This hotel was not very clean. We had to ask the maid to clean the bathroom really well. My biggest problem was the hotel never mentions that they allow dogs to stay there on its website. Nor, did the hotel advise you of this when you checked into it or gave an option of not sleeping on the same floor with dogs. I am a big dog lover but I do not want to stay in a hotel with dogs. Hotels are notorious for not being clean and dogs add their own germs to the environment. My friend has allergies and this was not a good environment for her. A hotel that allows dogs should advertise for all who do not want to or can not stay in that kind of environment. Also, the staff was rude and not very helpfull.'
5,'Elegant foyer sets the tone','The elegant foyer of this hotel is not a facade, it is REAL, gorgeous, and sets the tone for an exceptional hotel experience. From check-in to (and MUST MENTION!!!) concierge service, we felt \'cared for\' and helped during our 4-day stay. The rooms are standard sized, the beds are above average comfortable, the view is always New York -as in \'other buildings\' out every window (what else?) but what made me feel so good was the people who work there. The doorman hailed taxis for us, the restaurant was attentive, and the bar serves a great Manhatten.'
4,'well-managed property','The Marriott Marquis is an above average hotel with no weak points. Given its size and location, it must be one of the chain\'s flagship properties, and therefore get good management.\r\nThe main selling point is obviously the location right on Times Square, ideal for tourists. Fortunately, the rest of the hotel doesn\'t disappoint. The rooms are average-sized, with the standard Marriott decor. They appear to have been refurbished a few years ago; I found the beds quite comfortable, and all systems (lighting, ventilation, plumbing) quiet and functional.\r\nA special mention for the Schindler Miconic elevators, where upon entry of the destination floor, a computer designates the optimal elevator based on a number of factors: an intelligent choice for this type of tall building with high traffic.'
1,'Possible bed bugs -- beware!','The Affinia Manhattan seems like a nice enough hotel, but after waking up with multiple bites on my arms and legs, I\'m beginning to suspect bed bugs. I checked the mattress upon arrival and didn\'t see anything. Unfortunately, the staff had countless empty promises to check and call me. But they didn\'t. Stay at your own risk.'
4,'Clean, comfortable and a convenient location','Stayed for one night before flying out of the US.\r\nArrived a few hours before check-in, but thought I would ask if anything was available. The lady at the front desk not only found me a room for immediate check-in, but gave me a complimentary upgrade as well.\r\nMy room was on the 34th floor. My door was sandwiched between two others in a u-shape, however I never ran into anyone else while I was there. The room itself was of typical size for something in NY, but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean.\r\nThe power points were a little tricky to access, I had to get under the desk and leave my phone/laptop on the floor to charge. The only other negative was that it took a very very long time for the shower water to heat up. I had actually resigned myself to a luke warm shower, then part way through the water heated up enough that I had to turn on the cold tap a fair bit.\r\nLocation is fantastic, close to a couple of major subway stations and walking distance to Times Square. I chose this hotel specifically for the location as I knew I didn\'t have long to fit in all my shopping!\r\nBelow the lobby there is a small shop, mainly touristy trinkets, but conveniently also sells air mail stamps. There is a post box in the lobby, so I was able to send the postcards I had forgotten to write! Connecting to the lobby is the Tick Tock Diner, nothing special but after a long tiring day, was happy for a standard diner type meal simply for the convenience of not having to walk anywhere else.\r\nI would happily stay here again when I\'m next in New York.'
3,'Central Location Yet Can\'t Hear the Noise','I stayed in this hotel earlier this week for 3 nights and I was pleasantly surprised. I travelled solo so as a young female one of my concerns is always safety and for starters, this was not something that was ever an issue here. As other reviews have mentioned, there is always someone before you get to the elevator to check your room key. No key, no room access. \r\nYes there was construction still going on (visible in the lobby) but the hotel was always full of people coming or going (many young people) and I felt a great welcoming atmosphere from the moment I checked in. Speaking of checking in, I was ecstatic when I got to the hotel at 9:30am and they had a room already available for me. \r\nMy room was on the 31st floor and I could not hear any street noise (as was the case when I stayed in NYC during my last visit) although the noise of a constant fan in the room did get a bit annoying when trying to fall asleep.\r\nThe size of the room was small but it worked for me. Maybe if there were 2+ people sharing it, I could see it getting a bit tight. The bathroom was average size and as other read reviews state, there was an issue with the water - not a lot of pressure and either hot or cold - no in between. Again, I didn\'t mind this - I was only there for 3 nights and as long as I could shower, I was happy. \r\nThere was a good selection of movies, music to choose from if someone wanted to stay in and watch some television. I chose to listen to the clock radio every morning when I was getting ready to leave. There was a desk, a dresser and of course a closet equipped with the standard iron & ironing board. \r\nI would definately stay here again, mainly b/c of the location. Right on the subway lines and within walking distance to many of the major shops and attractions. I loved that there was a Starbucks right across the street and the adjoining 24hr diner was very convenient when I didn\'t want to travel far to get a filling yet cheap breakfast.'
4,'Agree with most of what has been said so far...','I came to Chicago with my Mom for the Oprah spectacular in May and we stayed at the Palmer house. I was the first to arrive in Chicago from Atlanta as my Mom was to join me later since she was flying in from Baltimore. I arrived much earlier than check-in time and thought I\'d just take a chance on leaving my bags at the counter so that I could rush to the United Center and pick up my tickets to the show. Being that I am not from Chicago I wanted to leave plenty of time to get to and from where I needed to go. The gentleman at the front allowed me to check in early. I was able to request a top floor since I\'d read to do so to prevent noise. I got on the 19th floor I believe it was room 19-113 lovely room, two beds and two bathrooms (which came in handy so that Mom and I could get ready for the show at the same time). We had a great stay here. \r\nIt took some getting used to for me at first because of the grandeur of the hotel. It\'s very opulent, but I get it, it\'s historic. I\'m used to more modern, chic hotels, but the main lobby does offer this and I think it\'s cool that the downstairs is right off of main streets and you can not beat the accessibility to the best that Chicago has in the way of tourism. The staff gave good old fashion accommodating service. I came in not sure if I would stay again because at first I felt it was over the top, and I left not sure if I would ever be able to stay anywhere but here. It was a great time in Chicago, and a wonderful at the Palmer House. Excellent Staff! \r\nWarning, the Concierge desk does get pretty busy so leave enough time to wait and ask your questions. Also leave a night to eat at the restaurant adjacent to the lobby. Felicia the manager is awesome and a true value to hotel! I hope this was helpful enjoy your visit!'
2,'needs to be renovated','i lived in nyc for 10 years and recently moved but i still have business in nyc and travel back once a month. last week I stayed here for 3 nights - it is a company choosen hotel. it\'s a great location right next to grand central so it\'s perfect for my work or for tourists.\r\ni\'ve stayed here 3 times this year - each time in a different room. this room was the worst of the bunch (I wasn\'t impressed with any room yet). all rooms that i\'ve stayed in were older with a few cosmetic updates such as new bedding, a decent tv and a new sink. all rooms tend to be dark with poor lighting and uncomfrtable pillows in my opinion.\r\nlast week i got stuck with room 2254. the room was basically the same as before with a decent view looking west. the room is older and had a musty smell. the carpet was OLD. it was held down, near the bathroom, with electrical tape. shocking, in my opinion. Not sure why they don\'t replace it instad of using tape to hold the frayed edges down. then the 1st morning I got a shower/ the shower is old & doesn\'t drain so i was stuck standing in dirty water. on my way out to meetings - i asked someone at the front desk to have the tub fixed and was assured that they would. the next morning - it was somewhat better but after 10 minutes the water filled up again. on top of that - the drain plug wasn\'t even attached to the tub but placed on the side of the tub. again, i asked for this to be fixed. the final morning - another shower, the plug still sitting on the side and the tub filled up yet again. i\'m not sure how many times you have to ask for something to be fixed but for the price I (or my company) paid, once should have been enough.\r\noverall, i think the hotel is in need of serious renovation, not just a cosmetic one. next month when i am in town - i am staying at a different company preferred hotel. it just isn\'t worth the price to me.'
3,'More about the location','Older hotel, with tiny rooms, uncomfortable beds, tiny bathroom, noisy air conditioning... but 30 metres from Times Square makes it all worth it. We were there for 5 nights, by the 3rd night my back was sore from the bed. We were on a strict budget so this was the cheapest we could find, but was still expensive for what it is, but you are in Times Square, so you cant complain. I would stay again for a couple of nights but if we were to stay in New York any longer, i would go somewhere else and spend a bit more. The restaurant is quite lovely and i believe they have built or are building a nightclub downstairs.'
2,'Good position-that\'s it','This hotel is in a good-excellent position in midtown, right in front of Madison square garden and Penn station. That\'s whay you pay for, because the room are small, old and they don\'t really give the impression of being clean, even though they are not really dirty. The staff is not really nice (maybe due to work overload) and there are thousands of people staying in this hotel. If you want to stay in midtown-Times sq zone this is the cheapest solution. Next time I am going to NY though I will not be staying here, you can find cheaper and better rooms in many other parts of the city, for example in the Lower east side or in Greenwich village!'
4,'great location','The hotel has a great location in manhattan. With the covered drive way for pick up and drop off of taxis your never have to get wet in the rain. The front desk staff was exceptional in taking care of our needs. The room was updated though a bit small in the bathroom. There is a Starbucks in the hotel. If you are hilton diamond you receive comp wifi and breakfast. That is a great value in nyc.'
3,'Exactly what we needed','Needless to say, I read a lot of the reviews and was willing to take a chance. You get what you pay for and more. We got there around 11 and needed to check our bag. We just paid and took it down to the lower level to store. We needed to use the bathrooms and you needed a key. We checked in around 4:45 and it was about a 30 min wait but we were prepared for that per all the reviews. We were pleasantly surprised when we got to our room. The room was huge with two double beds, large closet and high ceilings. It was outdated and the rugs needed to be cleaned but not as bad as i expected. We first checked for bedbugs and luckily found none. The bathroom was tiny but very clean. You can\'t beat the location - close to Penn Station, Empire State and the Thanksgiving Day Parade route. You also can\'t beat the price - I would recommend upgrading to the Penn 5000 Club. It was worth the $25 more for a better room and free breakfast (begals, pastries, coffee, juice, etc.). Would I stay here again???? It really depends on our NYC trip plans. There are so many better choices but this worked for us this time. I would not recommend it to others as there have been too many other bad experiences. I am very glad that it worked out for us.'
4,'Love its location','We stayed here for 5 days, no dramas. The hotel is located just across the Times Square. If you require basic accommodation just for sleeping in new york city, this is the right hotel for you'
2,'Won\'t go back','After searching multiple sources for a hotel room for under $200/night, I came across this hotel. I did read the reviews here on Trip Advisor but was based on the price and location of the hotel, I went ahead and booked. The only positive I can say about this place is that it\'s in a great location, right next to the subway and in the heart of midtown. Very easy to get anywhere from this hotel. As far as negatives, there are quite a few:\r\n- Check in line was excessively long. They need to improve this process\r\n- I asked for a recently renovated room, which they said they could not accomodate. I got a basic room. The door to the room was FILTHY. I was grossed out having to open it. The room had pealing paint everwhere, including a nice one inch pile of it in the corner. The carpet was stained. The wallpaper was peeling and stained. The remote control didn\'t work (we did ask for a new one and housekeeping did bring it up)\r\n- The bathroom was horrific. An unexplainable blue stain in the tub. I couldn\'t even take a decent shower due to the water being either too hot or too cold. The water pressure was horrible as well.\r\nI knew the risk in coming here. It\'s a shame you can\'t get a decent hotel room in NYC for $200. I guess we got what we paid for.'
5,'Wanting a special treat for my little 81 year old mother, I booked a room on the executive floor at the Hilton Palmer Ho','We were very pleased with the friendly, accommodating staff and our great room. We picked up our Go Chicago Card and our Grayline trolley pass in the gift shop there at the hotel. The location was great for accessing parks, museums, shopping and wonderful dining, either by walking, or nearby trolley and public transportation. We had a great lunch in the Walnut Room at Macy’s, a to-die-for Chicago pizza at Pizanos, and a real treat at the Russian Tea House; all within a very short walk from hotel. We went to see the Jersey Boys which was within a half block of the hotel. We ate at Portilla’s for our Chicago hotdog several blocks from the hotel, but Bus 22 dropped us off within a half block of Palmer House. Mom, my two sister’s and I made lasting memories on our trip.'
5,'Great Hotel','Had a great experience at this hotel. Staff extremely friendly especially John Muriel, Chef. I came across Mr Muriel in the elevator and asked of he knew where we could get some disposable utensils. He took me to restaurant and provided me with all I needed and he did it with a smile on. Front Desk associate also accommodated us in a larger room because we had a rollaway. The staff at the Crowne Plaza Time Square went out of their way to meet all of our need. The only negative thing I can say is not all of the maids replace the dirty glasses in room. Instead they wash them in bathroom sink. This is very unsanitary and worldwide problem in the hotel industry. I suggest hotels replace all glassware with disposable cups. We have brought this problem to the attention of hotel mgmt. in the past but not all maids are following this standard. One other suggestion to management is to power wash the back area of hotel opposite of back entrance where fountain area is located. It was very dirty'
4,'Great place to stay','Spent a week here back in September, and had a fantastic time, lovely hotel and can\'t fault the staff, The first night we were there, the air con packed up at 23:30 and within the hour a new unit had been fitted (service or what)I would reccomend anyone to stay there.'
5,'My 4th stay....highly recommended!','I can\'t fault the New Yorker hotel for location, amenities and service at a great (New York) price. The most recent trip was for my 40th birthday with 3 family members. The 1 br suite was spacious and very clean. I emailed ahead and we were given a corner suite with balcony. The front desk staff were very friendly, ticktock diner waiters were pleasant and housekeeping did an excellent job. I always recommend this hotel to others looking for a well priced hotel in a great location.'
5,'Great hotel in NYC','I have stayed in NYC now 4 times, each time we do better, this is my favorite hotel, clean, great service an right, yes right in times square! Great flatscreen tv, big size bathroom an nice beds! Star bucks in the lobby! Big drawback - the view restaurant soooooo overpriced! Dinner was just fair, buffet was 35 dollars a person, does not include even water, 12 dollars for 2 sodas no refills! 2 coffees 11.00 no refills! Try hard rock or bubba humps always great meal an we paid half the price! I was soooo disappointed in dinner 200 dollars an than waiter added 30 for his tip - for what not filling my sodas!'
4,'Great location','The room was nice enough and was clean enough . I was disappointed that we had such a bad view. The location was very close to Times Square and we walked to the Empire State Bldg. I was not impressed enough however to stay here again.'
4,'Consistently Best Hotel in Manhatten','I am a regular traveller to New York and where possible I prefer to say at the Park Central in Manhatten. I find that it offers an excellent level of service combined with good rooms, and an excellent location and convenient to the places I wish to travel too. The staff are well trained and attentive, and are eager to ensure that the stay there is a memorable experience. I recommend that if you happen to be staying there, ask for Elizabeth on the customer services team as I found her most helpful.\r\nPeter, Ireland.'
3,'Great location, rooms could be cleaner','I travel to NY frequently for business -- this was my first time at this hotel. Overall a decent experience, here is what I liked and did not like,\r\nThe good:\r\n- Location -- really central and super easy to get to subway \r\n- Check in and check out was easy and efficient\r\n- Room was pretty spacious, especially for New York and was remarkably quiet (I was on the 27th floor)\r\nThe bad:\r\n- Room cleanliness was probably a B- , eg there was dust caked in the air conditioning vent and mildew in the shower -- yuck\r\n- NO coffee makers in the room. I did not realize this till I woke up and found to my horror there was no coffee. I called down and had to request one which they brought up maybe 1/2 and hour later\r\n- When I got to my room there was an old beat up extra mini fridge shoved under the desk which I had to move so I could actually use the desk. It was really strange and looked trashy -- can\'t figure out why they would leave that there and was annoyed I had to move it out of the way . I called down and said there was this extra fridge in my room and the concierge was not at all surprised or apologetic but rather seemed surprised that I wanted it out. For the price of this hotel I\'d expect more. \r\nAll in all -- I would probably stay again because I liked the location but they have some areas to improve upon.'
5,'FABULOUS STAY!','What can I say! 42 floors up and a fantastic view from our corner room-Hudson River to the right Times Square to the left Room lovely- huge with 2 big double beds and lovely bathroom. Traffic? What traffic!? \r\nWe could see the long long queues at discount tix but who wanted to stand for hours in 97F for tickets. We went to theatre and got front row balcony for $66 each to see Kelsey Grammer and Douglas Hodge. Absolutely brilliant!!\r\nDrinks were a bit dear but on last day we had a huge turkey club sandwich which did the 2 of us for $11- well it did come with potato waffles too! Delicious!\r\nLifts were great-staff helpful-position excellent - brilliant coffee machine- would love to return!!'
4,'The common areas are outstanding!','The common areas of the hotel are outstanding. The main lobby area is breath-taking. Walking into that room brings you back! Attention to architectural detail is amazing. The hotel staff are wonderful and attentive; everyone was very polite and seemed genuinely concerned with guest satisfaction. \r\nThe downside for me was the room size. I didn\'t spend much time in the room, but what I had was small. The bathroom was tiny and the TV/dresser was somewhat in the way when walking into the room. There was a desk which was key since this was a business trip, but there was no chair to relax in, only a desk chair.\r\nThe bed was SUPER comfortable! Down pillows, etc. The hotel lobby bar was always crowded with a good atmosphere to relax or grab a drink. Overall a very good hotel and a nice stay. Very conveniently located to shopping and to the lake. Close to the CTA trains as well. I will definitely go back.'
4,'très bon hôtel...','l\'hôtel est d\'un bon rapport qualité/prix. chambres confortables. spacieuses. bonne literie. salle de bain 1 peu petite.\r\naccueil correct. buffet de petit déjeuner copieux. (19dollars HT) salle de restaurant attenante. très bonne cuisine. bar ouvert jusqu\'à 2h00.\r\nl\'hôtel est très bien situé, presque vis à vis du Madison Square. 7 Avenue, 34 ème Street.\r\n10mn de Time Square en remontant l\'avenue. Donc, on est presque au milieu de tout.'
1,'Don\'t be mislead by the photos - our stay was such a disspointment!','This 5 night stay in the Hotel Affinia Manhattan with my husband and two children was suppposed to be a special treat for my 40th birthday. It wasn\'t a treat at all. We had a suite on the 11th floor. It was extremely dark and dated. The furniture was shabby and mis-matched and it had the feel of a student bedsit. Everything was in need of updating. The windows were filthy, the air conditioning was noisy, the sofa bed was very uncomfortable, the wi-fi didn\'t work, the shower was tiny and the noise from the fire station was relentless through the night. We felt so mis-lead by the brochure pictures that we complained to our travel agent strongly urging them to reconsider recommending this hotel. We wrote a detailed letter containing photos and because of this we received a partial refund for our stay. Apparently SOME of the rooms are as pictured but obviously not all.'
3,'Great Location!','Our first trip to NYC was great. Edison Hotel was a great location for us to see the city. We could easily catch the subway or walk to Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Several restaurants were nearby as well as the theater district and the heart of Times Square. At night, we always felt like something was happening so we headed to Times Square to check things out. We did not know what to expect in terms of the hotel. The room we had was very small, but we\'ve heard that they are very small in NYC. The service was ok, nothing special. We stayed at this hotel because it was in a good location and affordable. We were so excited so to see the city that we really did not focus too much on the hotel itself. If your hotel stay and service are more important to you, then we would suggest another hotel. We would strongly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a great location to see the city. And the hotel\'s diner was great for coffee and breakfast.'
5,'The Westin New York at Times Square','Excellent hotel, location, and services provided. Very clean and up-to-date kept rooms. Very quiet hotel for the location. Great view from our window, spent three nights at the hotel. Would highly recommend a booking here.'
1,Poorest,'I made a reservatiionon 11/12 for the Palmer House for 11/21. I never received an e-mail only a confirmation number. Big Mistake! My family and friends had a great weekend planned until I called to reconfirm my State St room view. Misha (front desk)told me that I have a reservation but not at her Hilton hotel. My res. is for the Michigan Ave hotel. She said that they had plenty of rooms at the Palmer House with double beds for $129. Not to worry. I paid $148. she said she could book me, but not cancel my res. at the other hilton hotel. I would have to cancel with them. Hopefully I wouldn\'t get charged a cancellation fee I was transfered to Sylvia (Director of Reservations) who just appologized and said they only had rooms at the Palmer House with one king bed. But I told her that I needed a room for 3 adults. They offered a role away bed and that they would lower the price to $134. How confusing since Misha said room rates for 3 were $129 and that they had plenty of rooms with two double beds. After waiting 1.5 hours for Sylvia to call back with info about a room with two double beds I called and spoke with Kelly Walsh (Assit Director) who just apologized and said Sylvia was working on it. It had already been two hours since I first found out that I didn\'t have reservations at the Palmer House with a State St View. Why would I request a State St view from the Michigan Hotel location. My holiday was ruined thanks to Hilton. I ask to be refunded without paying a penalty and Kelly Walsh said that she could not give me a cancelation number but that her name and word would be enough. So I ask why would anyone every stay at any of your hotels again? They couldn\'t find me a room yet they had rooms available. I book another Hotel.'
3,'Close to the Garden','I booked this hotel and bought Knick tickets for my wife’s birthday. We bused in from Baltimore and were dropped off across the street from the hotel. They allowed us to check in early, 12:15, and we stashed our bag and went across the street to Madison Square Garden for the game vs. the Heat. We had booked a 5000 club room with king bed, refrigerator and flat screen TV. $168 a night included coffee and bagels in the a.m. The front desk was friendly; lobby had a lot of action and 2-3 restaurants where you could pick up a snack and a drink. The room was clean, could use some paint, and the late night revelers were somewhat noisy. The location is perfect if you are coming from DC / Baltimore for a play or a game, everything you need is in safe, walking distance.'
1,'Over rated, over priced............over it.','I am pretty sure that if there is a hell, the Hudson Hotel is pretty much a replica of Lucifer\'s lair...........perhaps without the garish green neon lighting.\r\nThe room was so tiny it is beyond ridiculous, the bathroom is a joke, literally impossible to turn around 360 degrees with your arms spread out - oh, I was actually in a \'superior room\' so I dread to think what size shoebox a \'standard room\' would be.. \r\nAnd a hotel that rates itself as highly as this one does should surely provide free wifi access?\r\nDont get me started on the staff, arrogant oiks all of them who clearly believe their own press and strut around full of their own self importance - if you are going to wear a tie, do it up properly.'
2,Shabby!,'The New Yorker was to put it simply, a shabby experience. From the outside signs with paint peeling to the interior old and grubby carpets. The lobby was impressive with beautiful decor, if you ignore the carpets and slightly dated chairs. \r\nThe reception staff were too busy to be friendly, but were helpful...cleaning crew were always polite and friendly, as was the doorman. Rooms were always cleaned to a high standard, but no Tea/coffee facilities was inconvenient at best. Room was tiny with a view of opposite building and very very noisy! Heating system made terrible racket and air con system (at 28 floors up), let in all the street noise.\r\nLuggage storage upon departing should be avoided as it seems to be a chaotic and tedious process.\r\nThis cost 1398 euro for 4 nights.\r\nLocation was great , quick walk to most places, broadway, macys and circle line tours.\r\nWould I stay again? No. Would like to recommend for someone looking for a good location and not looking for luxury, but really, at those prices it wouldnt be my first choice. Not an accurate reflection of the advertisement on the website.'
2,'Run down hotel - Good location - Average Breakfast - Good Staff','If you are used to clean, new hotels then this hotel is NOT for you. We stayed at the newly renovated section of the hotel and the rooms/hallways were still rather shabby and run down. We supposedly had a larger room with two double beds and a small washroom. Actually the room was quite cramped but manageable.\r\nThe hotel felt more like a hostel than a hotel but after one day we sort of got used to it. The staff were pleasant enough. One thing that I thought was strange was how dark the hallways were - it was if all the bulbs were on a dimmer switch.\r\nThe location was ideal and ultimately this is what you are paying for. My main concern were bed bugs which luckily did not appear.\r\nThe fitness room was on the 19\'th floor however the elevator only went up to the 18\'th. From there you had to walk up a shabby set of stairs (kind of creepy) to the gym which had decent enough fitness machines.\r\nUltimately you get what you pay for (150 per night) and if you want a nicer hotel you can either spend an extra 100 dollars per night or stay in Newport, New Jersey at the beautiful Westin Hotel for the same price and take the 10 minute Path train ride into and out of NYC.'
4,'Well placed hotel with good size room','Stayed in the Affinia for 3 nights and booked a suite to have a bit more space - was very pleased with the refurbished room. Only down side was that wi-fi was charged at $14.95 per night whereas as all the other hotels on our 15 days trip had free wi-fi.'
5,'16 years and counting!','It has been 16 years since my first time in Park Central and every time I\'m in town I stay with them. Probably one of the best locations, clean rooms and a staff willing to help. If you have a special request, ask for Elizabeth and I bet she will do everything possible to assist you just like she did to me last time I stayed with them.'
2,'Not worth the $$ spent!','Stayed here Aug 2012 - Weather in Aug is extremely hot & humid ( I would not go again in Aug)\r\nThe hotel looks better in the pictures then it does in person, it looks bit old on the outside, but nicer on the inside. The rooms are a nice size and it was clean.\r\n There wasn’t enough staff at the front counter helping people check-in/checkout there was like 2 people serving and the guest line formed quiet quickly, people were getting frustrated, but they didn’t seem to care. We got there early at 10:30 am and check-in wasn’t until 4pm. The woman said come back at 1pm we should have a room (we came back at 1pm and they said oh our computer system isn’t working wait a while, they didn’t have a room still), then they said come back 2pm, we returned at 4 for our room and got it, but wasted time going back/forth to hotel. They charge a $3.75/bag fee to hold your bags – most likely why they don’t have rooms so they can charge to keep your bags and make some extra cash.\r\nI feel that the cost to stay there is not worth the price – it’s definitely did not look/feel like a $200/night hotel – you basically are paying for the location – and still need to walk many blocks before you get to times square. It’s very close to central park though. You are able to book a shuttle back to the airport thru the hotel concierge – the price is more than what you would pay at the airport. \r\nAlso the concierge service is slow and doesn’t have enough people to serve this large hotel. We had to wait about ½ hr for the guy to return to the concierge desk (he went to lunch and there was no backup person to serve the hotel customers), there was one girl who had to wait over 1hr to pickup her show tickets which was going to start in the next 15 mins – not good service I say.\r\nThe hotel is next to a Starbucks and several food places.\r\nI would say save your money stay somewhere else – I would not stay here again nor recommend it to anyone. For $200/night you expect extra quality and service which we did not receive.'
4,'Great Location, Great Deal','I got a super deal - $105 plus taxes through Priceline. You can\'t beat that on a Saturday night in NYC. \r\nSuper location, and ok service.\r\nReception is up an escalator, which I always think is a bit mad - having to drag your things on one, but receptionist was efficient. No real effort made, but its a busy hotel, and he had probably had enough!\r\nSeemed ok, but as I was walking the corridor (17th fl) I was begining to get a bit worried, v. plain and drag, but actually the room was a pleasant surprise. Decent size (bit rare in big city like NY) and new duvet. V. cosy. \r\nBathroom was a bit small - the walk in closet was just as big, - bit silly really - would rather have had a regular closet and a good sized bathroom. Nonetheless good shower pressure.\r\nExcellent deal - but I don\'t think I would have been thrilled had I paid the $200+ I saw on their website. \r\nI suggest all looking on priceline, as this was a super deal for $105, but for $200+ I just expect more.\r\nOh - also note this is a MASSIVE hotel - so even if you pay the high rates I doubt you would get any kind of decent service.'
4,'Central location','The Affinia Manhattan is extremely well placed for sightseeing and shopping - we could walk to Central Park, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, 5th Ave, Times Square, etc - and we were bang opposite Penn Station, so the airtrain/NJ Transit to and from the airport worked brilliantly.\r\nWe stayed in a one bed suite for four nights; our daughters had the sofa bed and we had the bedroom - but the lack of a window and aircon in the bedroom meant we had to keep the door open. Not a problem for us, but might not work for friends travelling together. Otherwise the room was good, nicely refurbished and the fridge in the kitchen area was very useful.\r\nWe had breakfast in the hotel on the first day ($19 each) but on the other days we went to the Cosmic Cafe on W31st Street, between 6th and 7th Ave (the hotel is on the corner of 7th and W31st) for about $20 for all of us. Wifi is expensive ($15 for 24 hours) so we had a cup of coffee in MacDonalds a couple of hundred yards up 7th Ave....\r\nThe concierge was so helpful - she recommended a good family diner, gave us maps, etc. you can also print boarding passes at the desk.\r\nThe only downside really was the noise as the windows really didn\'t shut out the sound of car hooters which go continually, all night. However, we felt it added to the NY experience!'
5,'First class hotel in NYC','My wife & I have just had a wonderful holiday in NY & stayed in a wonderful hotel. The rooms are very well appointed & have slept in what is probably the most comfortable bed in the world!!!!\r\nThe people who work here are obviously very well engaged - nothing is too much trouble & the food at breakfast is first class.\r\nIf you are looking for a hotel to stay when in NY then look no further - we too are cautious about comments or referrals on line but have faith - this hotel is a real gem!'
3,'OK but can\'t compete with Hilton Garden Inn on Grand','Why is it that the top tier hotels in a chain provide less quality than those in the value segment when they charge about $50 per night more? I couldn\'t get my favourite Hilton Garden Inn 10 E Grand Ave. Chicago, so had to settle for the Palmer House. Yes it\'s a glamourous hotel, but the bathroom is very small (unless you\'re a short supermodel) and the internet is not included in the room rate. So I had to forgo the internet because I refuse to pay extra when it should be included. The king size bed was extremely comfortable as were the pillows. I was here on business, so it was a perfect location only 2 blocks from the office. There are some very fine eateries nearby. I had breakfast the first morning in the lobby restaurant. The continental buffet is good value for the price ($13) but I don\'t know why they can\'t provide you with self service beverages. One needs to wait for interminably slow wait staff. Make sure you have exact cash or charge it to your room. So if you want to have a good breakfast and get on your way, go to the Corner Bakery on the corner of Monroe and Wabash. Noise is a bit of a problem. I was not directly facing the L, but I could hear the trains. I could also hear my next door neighbours talking, and they weren\'t talking loudly. Overall the hotel is fine in a pinch, but if you like Hilton properties, you get better value at the Hilton Garden Inn on Grand Ave.'
4,'Nice Stay','I have stayed here on multiple occasions and this hotel offers a great location in the heart of New York City. I used rewards points to get two rooms for a family birthday and they accommodated us with rooms next to each other. I was a little disappointed with the view given (rewards platinum) and the rooms state they have queen beds but they seemed a little small although comfortable. Staff for the most part was very nice and the hotel has everything you need just bring your wallet as things are expensive.'
3,'location is tops','Myself and my partner had a long weekend at the Hyatt, booked the hotel thru priceline for £87 per night, which is about a fair reflection to be honest, its location would be hard to better, being next door to Grand Central station, indeed you can access the hotel from the concourse of the station.\r\nRooms are clean, bathroom is ok, large screen LCD with the usual channels, however no ESPN!! Don`t expect a view from your room here as it is overlooked on all sides despite being a consdierable size itself! \r\nMy only real complaint was that you can hear the slightest noise from the room next door thru the joining door indeed i had to ring the main desk after being woken at 3 am by two returning guests next door on consecutive nights, however they were alot quieter on the third night.\r\nI can`t comment on the food or the bar scene at the hotel as i didn`t once bother em, i prefer the real New York eating and drinking experience.\r\nOn the whole it was as expected, no better, no worse.\r\nGive Smith & Wollensky`s on 3rd Ave, a wide bearth, my 4th and final visit this trip, it is trading on past glories and is too stuffy for my liking, tip less than 20\% and they won`t even acknowlege you leaving!! a better bet is about 10 blocks north, PJ Clarkes, a really friendly bar, mixed clientele, food available til 3am and the Maryland Crabcakes are exceptional, the olde world bar and the jukebox to match make it a perfect hang out'
4,'Good location and price','We stayed at the Edison June 6 and 7. You can\'t find a\r\nbetter location, and the price was great. When we arrived\r\nin the morning, our room was ready for check in. The\r\nstaff and service were fine. The beds were comfortable,\r\nand even though the building is old the room is fairly\r\nclean except for an unidentified stain on the wall (yuck)\r\nand hair in the bathroom (what is it about hair in the\r\nbathroom-every motel review mentions this........eeeeek).\r\nThe room was quiet and I didn\'t hear sounds from the\r\nstreet or other rooms.....had a non-smoking room\r\nand never smelled smoke...........'
3,'Decent property. Outrageous food prices.','This is a huge mid-town business type hotel. I stayed here for 2 nights based on a promotion to hear a presentation on the Hilton Club.\r\nThis place is always busy and bustling with activity. The mid-town location is probably the best feature of this hotel.\r\nCheck-in was very fast and easy. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. \r\nThe room was a decent size for NYC standards. It seems like it was a renovated room. It had marble bathroom,flat screen TV, and very tasteful furnishings. My room was on 7th floor with only a view of buildings but there was next to no street noise. View wasn\'t a big deal for me since I wasn\'t in the room very much. \r\nHere is why I only gave the property 3 stars.\r\nFirst off, Forget about getting an elevator between 8am and 8pm. There was always a wait. I waited as much as 10 minutes for an elevator. There was a modeling convention in the hotel when I was there and I am sure the hotel was at or near capacity but you figure the engineers would know their hotel would sometimes be filled to capacity and would have planned accordingly. \r\nSecondly, The prices for food and room service are beyond outrageous for this class of hotel. Afterall, I expect high prices at a more upscale 5 star property like a Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental but not at a Hilton.\r\nIt was 26 bucks for 2 eggs sausage and homefries,28 bucks for a hamburger. 19 bucks for a simple BLT sandwich. Something is wrong when 2 people are spending 60 bucks for an barely average basic breakfast. There is no excuse to charge those prices. Hilton seems to like to gouge customers. Also, they charge for internet use which is another form of gouging customers for every dime.\r\nRoom service was even more expensive than the restaurant. \r\nOverall, this is a decent property with nice rooms,friendly staff, average food(surely a very poor value) though if you go remember to bring a fat wallet to eat or better yet don\'t eat there. The only reason I dined there was convenience. If I had more time, I would have never dined there. There are many places close by where you can get a decent breakfast or lunch for 1/4 the prices they charge at the Hilton.'
5,'tout simplement parfait','Idéalement situé,en plein Times Square a côté de plein de lignes de metro. Déco moderne inspirée des années 30, chambres impeccables et grandes, literie parfaite, salle de bain superbe avec des jets de douches génials. Les chambres Deluxes, c\'est à dire étage élevé ont une vue magnifique. On ne prenait pas les petits déj ni les repas à l\'hotel car chers et vous avez le choix aux alentours à tous les prix.On était 3 dans la chambre et c\'était parfait . On a en effet partagé une seule vasque mais superbe en inox avec un plan long pour tout poser. Les lits sont de 120 ou 140 ? en effet un peu serré à deux mais qu\'on on s\'aime ... les américains dorment chacun dans un grand lit. Si vous voulez de la place il faut prendre 2 chambres à 4.On a pas essayé le SPA en supplément.'
4,'Modern & clean but no athmostphere','Clean & nice furniture, everything brand-new. Very modern. \r\nGood location, direct access to Grand Station, tube, shops etc...\r\nProbably the #2 largest hotel in NY - so little chance to make connection with staff (automatic check in/out machines is encouraged like in the airport). No real athmostphere.\r\nInternet not complimentary and rather expensive - outrageous for the room price'
5,'Every thing ya need ya will love it','Just stayed in the new yorker for three nights rooms a little small and dated but who cares you don\'t spend any time in it. Great location would highly recommend this hotel view from our room was awsome , tick tock dinner for breakfast , on site bar for drinks what mote da ya need quality\r\nRob and Ang \r\nbeverley east yorkshire Uk'
2,'Renovation failure','We stayed in a newly renovated king room. While the renovation has made the lobby, corridors and rooms look very cool and modern we experienced ever so many problems with the new decor. Starting with the lobby, the furniture is placed in such a way that when groups gather there the furniture forms a barrier and causes them to block the walkways from the elevators to the escalators. The line for the front desk also gets channeled into the walkways and it can be trying to get through the lobby.\r\nThe corridors are the best part of the renovation. They are full of style and a pleasure to walk through. However, the rooms are truly the biggest problem area. Whoever selected the furnishings picked them on the basis of their cool factor and did not give enough thought to practical matters. Most of the furniture is built atop a wooden base. The base extends up to about 4 inches beyond the sofa, media center or whatever is above it. Why is this a problem? Well, as you walk through the room skirting the furniture, you might misjudge the narrow passages as I did and end up with a severely injured foot on your vacation or business trip. Word to the wise--only walk around the room with shoes on. Other furniture choices were also dumb. There is the elliptical table that takes up lots of room but has no storage and the funky lamp above it that hangs at the height of your head which my daughter kept hitting when she stood up from the sofa.\r\nAs some have mentioned before, the pillows are really uncomfortable and in my particular room the bed sagged badly and produced a very uncomfortable night\'s sleep. The comments about the toilet location are also on target. You have to awkwardly reach backward to get toilet paper. But the bathroom hardware is awfully cool and trendy. \r\nI think I will avoid this uber trendy hotel in the future for someplace more comfortable. It used to be a favorite place for us to stay but that is now history.'
4,'Wunderbare zentrale Lage!','Das Hotel hat eine super Lage, Macy\'s und der Broadway sowie die Lexington Ave lassen sich sehr gut per Fuß erreichen und dem Shopping-Faktor steht nichts im Wege. Ebenfalls sind öffentliche Verkehrsmittel unmittelbar angeschlossen. Die Eingangshalle läßt keinesfalls vermuten, dass es sich hierbei um ein 2 Sterne Hotel handelt. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption sind freundlich, aber es müssen manchmal längere Wartezeiten in Kauf genomen werden. Die Zimmer erinnern allerdings sofort daran, das es sich nur um ein 2 Sterne Haus handelt. Die Größe der Zimmer variiert, aber man hat genug Platz. Ein Einbauschrank (mit Bügelbrett, Bügeleisen, Fön), ein Schreibtisch, ein Stuhl, 2 Sessel und ein kleiner Tisch gehören neben 2 Betten zum Mobiliar. Die Zimmer sind gereinigt, aber eben nur so, wie man es von einem Hotel dieser Kategorie erwarten kann.Kabel liegen offen herum, Steckdosen sind lose und mit kleinen Kindern wirklich sehr gefährlich. Das Bad ist sehr grob gereinigt. Die Toilette war in Ordnung, an der Duschwanne waren Schimmel, Rost und Kalkablagerungen. Das Waschbecken war mit 2 Metallstreben gestützt, an die man keinesfalls ranstoßen durfte. Die Heizung bzw. Klimaanlage machte sovie Lärm, das man dachte,man schläft inmitten einer Baustelle. Für einen Kurztrip zum Shoppen ist das Hotel ideal, da man lediglich dort übernachtet und super Zentral anliegt, für einen längeren Aufenthalt ist es nicht empfehlenswert.'
4,'It\'s a perfect location','It\'s a perfect location, when you reserve, ask for a room with 2 large beds, the romm is large with good furniture, the bath room is comfortable and the matessses were very good !\r\nthe only reproach is the desk, where they are not very kind ! It is impossible to make the check in before 3 pm, when you arrive at 10 am, you must leave your luggage and pay for this'
4,'Ubicacion, la mejor a precio accesible.b','Si vas en invierno a NYC, esta es la mejor ubicacion.El hotel es viejo y sin duda necesita\r\nSer remodelado, lo que creo que no ocurrira.es enorme, ademas de la entrada principal tiene dos laterales que son muy utiles los dias que hay nieve y frio extremo.las habitaciones son chicas, las camas muy comodas, ya estuve alli varias veces y nunca se pudo abrir la ventana, debe estar bloqueada por la calefaccion. No derrochan limpieza, la primera impresion no es buena, pero todo lo olvidas por su excelente ubicacion, todos los subtes estan alli mas ta Penn Station eso esimpagable sobre todo en invierno, la vereda esta calefaccionada y en menos de 2min , de verdad ya estas en el subte, o cruzas la avenida y esta la estacion que por debajo te comunica con mas lineas de subte. Estas en Times Sq, en 15 min desde tu cuarto del hotel.hay cerca de todo, para comer, tiendas, etc..Es cierto que siempre tiene detalles para arreglar, algo oxidado, siempre el equipo de aire con falta de limpieza, o manchas en la pared, pero no es tan importante, por el precio que pagas no se consigue esa ubicacion, hay que reservar la habitacion con tiempo para obtener buen precio. Tiene muchos ascensores asi es que no hay que esperar y se puede dejar el equipaje antes o despues de chequearse , cobran por cada bulto pero es seguro.\r\nLo peor, hay demasiada demora para el check in porque hacen esperar a todos hasta las 3 de la tarde y se juntan mas de 100personas, mejor que te quedes alli desde las 14.30 o vuelvas despues de las 17 porque sino pasaras tu tarde de NYC en la cola de espera. El check out es express por buzon . hay un par de empleadas en el front desk que son muy poco amables ojala no te atiendan !'
3,'Great price and location. The hotel is dated but comfortable and economic','After reading the other reviews I was a little skeptical. I booked a club room and avoided the long check in line by going to VIP check in. Gorgeous lobby. The room was decent with a comfortable king bed, flat screen tv, mini fridge and desk. The water pressure in the shower was awesome! The hotel could use an update, get rid of the carpets and maybe wallpaper the rooms to avoid the walls looking beat up.'
4,'Location, location, location','We stayed at the Park Central for 6 nights whilst in NYC - I must first say that picking a hotel in NYC was one of the scariest and worrying times for me when planning our trip to the ISA.\r\nThanks to reviews from people on Trip Advisor I picked the perfect hotel for us :) :)\r\nThe location was marvelous - 7th Avenue a few blocks one way you\'re in Central Park about 5 blocks the opposite direction and you\'re in Times Square. This position couldn\'t be better - we were central to everything and enjoyed our nightly stroll down to Times Square.\r\nI thought this hotel was managed and run very well for it\'s sheer size. We had a room on the 12th floor not facing Seventh Avenue but we could see Seventh Avenue if we looked out the window. The room itself i thought was quite a nice size. King size bed was super comfy and clean (yes we did check for bed bugs before we brought our luggage into the room).\r\nBathroom was a little outdated but did the job perfectly with a super hot and powerful shower.\r\nStaff at reception were always friendly and always kindly answered our many questions.\r\nWe paid an unbelievable $120.00 a night in the heart of NYC for value for money, service and location we couldn\'t have asked for a better hotel. \r\nWe wouldn\'t hesitate to stay here again.'
4,'Great location, great service, great Hotel','Stayed at Hotel Edison from 6/5/12 to 6/7/12. We got there early and was welcomed by Tony, front desk clerk, room assigned quickly. I\'ve been visiting this hotel for many years. Great location, good service. Always have breakfast at their Cafe. Good service, good food. This is an Art Deco Hotel, old but in excellent conditions. Rooms are comfortable, beds are good and clean.\r\nThe bathroom is a bit small, but has the needed space. Just remenber this is an hotel build long ago, but has been well maintain and has the best staff. We\'ll stay there every time I visit New York, GREAT LOCATION, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT HOTEL'
4,'We love the Edison','Ordinarily, my mother and I stay at the Edison for a mother/daughter week each year. This year, we decided to go all out and spend Spring Break with my husband, two daughters (18 and 25) my mother and I. What a treat! We arrived VERY early, and I voiced my concern about having my 67 year old mother\'s single room on the same floor as my husband and myself. The desk staff went above and beyond and gave us all three rooms on the same floor and side by side. My mother\'s single room was way beyond average. While our other two rooms were just as nice. I can\'t give an opinion about the cafe on site, but there is an OUTSTANDING cafe just on the other side of the Marriott\'s tunnel named Junior\'s! Superior breakfast and (for NYC) a very reasonable cost. As far as dining experiences go, exploring the restraunt row is almost as fun as shopping! Speaking of shopping, China Town is a hoot! Give it a try for faux or more designer bags and jewlery. But I digress...Back to the Edison....There is a quaint little bar in the lobby. It was a cozy atmosphere in which to get a really great cocktail after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. The bar staff was very friendly and knew their way around a Cosmo. As other posters have noted, the Edison is not in any way, shape, or form one of the newer mega-hotels, but it is charming in it\'s own right. I will continue to stay at the Edison on every future stay.'
5,'I love this place I can really recomend to stay at Edison hotel.','Nice place supernice staff i love the room and the location of the hotel. next time we are in new york this is were we want to live.'
3,'Disappointing grande dame with attributes','I love older hotels with character and therefore was looking forward to staying at the Palmer House.\r\nThe Palmer House is in the heart of the loop, which is dark and dreary compared with North Michigan Avenue, where the center of gravity for the leisure traveler is located. The main entrance of the hotel is on a side street off State Street that is dark and less than appealing, especially since Carson\'s department store across the street is now closed and dead. You get the feeling the spot is past its sell by date.\r\nThe hotel must have close to a thousand rooms. The lobby is truly something to see, truly old world gorgeous. Sadly, though it is large, it isn\'t large enough for the traffic the hotel generates, making for a crowded feeling.\r\nMy room, a junior suite, was large, newly renovated in a distinctly upscale look with a most comfortable bed. No complaints, but rather praise, for the room.\r\nThe hotel was loaded with groups (a high school prom, three weddings, plus others), which \r\nI find off-putting as an individual traveler. As if hundreds and hundreds of guests were not making the lobby busy enough, on two or three occasions over two days, cheesy banquet tables were placed in the lobby and then roped off. The look was truly cheesy and the effect was to detract from the beauty and turn the lobby into an obstacle course.\r\nI have stayed at several other 4* hotels in Chicago and when I compare the Palmer House to the group, the Palmer House seems less upmarket and refined. Sadly that is my primary memory of the Palmer House.\r\nIf you have business downtown, the location is ideal. The rooms have been nicely renovated and stack up well to 4* competition and no one has built a lobby that looks as classy in 75 years. The hotel needs to move the entrance to the light of State Street and improve the scene to be truly competitive with other 4* hotels.'
1,'They scam you with your credit card','I stayed at this hotel for the 4th of july, not only was the room terrible, not enough towels, broken phone & broken tv, vending machines took money. The service was terrible i complained & they did nothing!! They over charged my credit card $200.00 for this horriffic stay. Now 3 months later i am still fighting for my money & they keep taking a penny out of my credit card account then a few days later returning the penny, This is there attempt to correct my overcharge!I complained to the BBB & go figure the hotel refused to respond to the BBB. Stay awy from this horrible place'
3,'Fine for a couple of nights','With such a good location and the Hyatt reputation I had high hopes for a hotel called the Grand Hyatt, but was disappointed. The room was recently decorated, but still felt a little basic. I asked for a high floor and got the 24th. But was it dark with a small window and had no view except hotel walls so could have been anywhere. I queried at the desk whether this was normal for the price I paid and they confirmed the room was standard. They would have moved me, but as the room was standard there seemed little point in taking the offer.\r\nBreakfast was not a buffet and it wasn\'t truly \'a la carte\', as they claimed because you could only order fixed menus. Trying to get what I actually wanted felt like an excerpt from the Monty Python \'Spam\' sketch. There was always something you didn\'t want that came with it. And breakfast starts with coffee and orange juice - $12 spent before you feel you\'ve started. Amazingly, a bowl of porridge will cost you another $14 - nearly ten quid! If you have a company budget, very hard to stay in control of cost and very easy to exceed a fixed cost buffet. Plus tips, of course.\r\nThe entrance is very modern and does look grand, but once you get past that it\'s fairly basic. Not even a bathtub in the room - shower only.\r\nBut location is good, New York hotels are all pretty expensive and trouble staying in control of cost is a bit endemic to the New York style of business anyway. Three stars because it\'s at least clean, you can\'t call it bad - just disappointing - and the staff were all very diligent and concerned.\r\nTip - Buy your porridge in one of the cafes opposite from $2 and max $8, depending on how nice you want your cafe. Or have a good value full American.'
3,'are you SURE you need to stay on Times Square?','First let me say this hotel was perfectly acceptable for the price we paid.\r\nThis hotel is an extremely big central hotel right on times square.\r\nWhen you plan a trip to NY you think you want to stay right on times square.\r\nIt might not be such a great idea for everyone in fact. \r\nYou would be much better off staying a few blocks off of times square in a quieter neighborhood.\r\nAll the restaurants on Times Square are huge industrial factories where you have to wait for hours before getting a table. Much better to be in a less busy area and just around the corner from a great family run place.\r\nIn any case you just take a taxi anywhere you want to go, staying right on Times Square is more of an inconvenience than a benefit.\r\nStaying in a nicer neighborhood and visiting Times Square by day would have been a much better choice for us.\r\nThis hotel is a huge industrial hotel (for example, you must always wait in line to be able to speak to someone at the front desk no matter what time it is.. this annoys me already...)\r\nOn the plus side, we staid in the executive floors and the rooms were well appointed (although wc stopped up and overflowed, maintenance brought a plunger within a reasonable delay).\r\nThe executive floor lounge was really nice. You could have a lite breakfast or snack there, people could get out of the room and take their computers there or go watch TV. It was really nice to have this lounge.\r\nNote: they show a swimming pool in the photos; it is microscopic and filled with people who come every day to do laps (no room for hotel guests in the pool). Health club has OK equipment but is in a room with no windows.\r\nIn-hotel dining is outrageously expensive. Go across the street (or rather take a taxi to another neighborhood you\'ll pay half the price for better service and food).'
5,'Great hotel, Great location!!','We stayed at this hotel twice. Before and after a cruise on the eastern coast. I am a Starwood Prefered Guest and used points, so the room did not cost me anything.\r\nWe only stayed one night before boarding our cruise ship. We arrived at the hotel at around 5:00pm and were given a roon quickly. We were placed on the 29th floor. Excellant view in a spacious room. The only thing we did not like was the sink. It is a stainless steel sink which doesn\'t provide much room for your toiletries. However, they do provide a shelf to put things on. \r\nThe flat screen tv\'s, heavenly bed and shower were the rooms biggest assests. \r\nWe did eat breakfast at Sula\'s the next morning, it is located inside the hotel. Very expensive, but you do get a lot of food. I would suggest splitting a meal or go somewhere else. There are several other resturaunts close by that are much cheaper.\r\nAfter our cruise we returned for a three night stay. This time we were given an upgrade to a 43rd fl corner view room. However, since we arrived early (9:30 am) from the ship, the room was not ready. \r\nWe left our bags with the bellman and decided to go for a walk. However, it was raining. No problem! The hotel offered us use of their umbrellas without even asking. Now that\'s great service!\r\nWhen we returned about 1:30 our room was ready. What a fantastic room and view. We did not want to leave. This hotel is in a perfect location. A block from Times Square. A short walk and you are in the middle of everything. Actually the sidewalks are packed, but that\'s what Times Square is all about, right?\r\nWithin the hotel is Chevy\'s mexican food. Very reasonably priced and good food. There are also theaters in the hotel. \r\nWe did go to Shula\'s (famous for their steaks) for dinner. The prices are outrageous! It was about $150 for the two of us and that only included one glass of wine, but did include a couple of sides and desert. The sides are huge and should be shared. The desert was fantastic. Just watch out for the prices.\r\nThe hotel\'s location is key. Right across from the port authority and next to the subway. We took the subway down to battery park to catch the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. If you want to go into the base of the statue, go early as the tickets sell out by 9:00. We then walked to ground zero, to take a moment. We returned to the subway and made our way home. \r\nOh, I forgot to mention John\'s pizza. It is world famous and right around the corner from the hotel. It is so good we ate there twice. \r\nI would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. If I ever return, I will be staying there again!'
1,'Believe what you read','Our travel agent booked this hotel for us ,and stupidly despite what I read on Tripadvisor I didn`t ask for a change. This is really the pits. Dirty,smelly, blood in the bath, stains on the walls , grubby bedding, carpets that reeked of urine. I complained immediately on arriving in my room about the appalling state it was in and the fact that there was blood in the bath. With complete indifference and absolutely no surprise or apology they handed me the keys to a second room. This one reeked of stale urine. It was late at night after a long journey , my wife sat on the bed and cried . She refused to undress and get in the bed. I went downstairs paid for internet connection and booked another hotel losing my money. On checking out they refused to talk to me about the problems I had. Even when I caused a scene. New York is a first class city ,how do they allow third world accomodation in their city. Surely there must be authorities who could close this down. Please don`t ever consider staying here.'
1,Horrible,'This hotel is like staying in a dark cave and sleeping on a futon. I booked this thru priceline so had a rate of $150 per night but it was so not worth even this. Room was tiny, tiny. TV was an old 13 inch model with poor picture. Bathroom was so tiny it was hard to move in. Worst was the bed so near the floor is was difficult to get in or out of.'
3,'Muy bien situado','Aunque las habitaciones del hotel no son una maravilla, lo bueno es que está muy bien situado, muy cerca del Empire State, Flatiron y Times Square. El precio nos pareció razonable y la limpieza tambié estuvo muy bien. Nos gustaría volver allí.'
5,'Renovated, Beautiful, Feel The History!','I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel. I did get it through priceline for under $100. But, I would have been satisfied if I paid anything under $200 for my experience.\r\nWe were here for a romantic getaway. The hotel public spaces are amazing. History all around you and much more interesting than your usual new age/post modern upscale hotel. Google The Empire Room, which is just off the lobby, to fully understand what used to happen at the Palmer. The hotel lobby and bar were buzzing the night we were there. Made for a great place to unwind and enjoy a drink. Nice Christmas Tree in the lobby. $14 for a glass of champagne and $6 for a Miller Lite! Welcome to a hotel bar in Chicago! Can\'t complain though.\r\nI called a couple days ahead of our scheduled stay to request a king and let them know I was proposing marriage to my longtime girlfriend. We were upgraded to the executive level upon check in with no request on my behalf. BTW service and staff at the hotel were great. The room was adequate and functional (room 23-250). Clean, comfortable. King size bed. Nice appointed room. Small bathroom, but nice and clean. Nothing more. More than fine for our wants/needs. The executive level has a public space area for working and hanging out with friends. There is also an area for complimentary snacks an drinks during the day (cookies, soda, water, coffee/tea). And at night it looked like the alcohol came out, but I don\'t know if it was complimentary. Breakfast is also served on the executive level in the morning. We had to pass to catch a flight. But it looked nice.\r\nLocation is great. Shopping, dining, theaters, and business right outside the door. We ate at Italian Village (The Village). Open till midnight during the week which fit our needs just perfect. Great wine, decent food. It\'s about 100 yards down Monroe from the hotel. Macy\'s, Nordstrom Rack, Loehman\'s, Filene\'s Basement all within a short walk for shopping.\r\nThe train is right outside the hotel for the red line (quick 2-3 minutes to River North/Mag Mile) and the Orange Line (25-30 minutes to and from Midway).\r\nI have read reviews on here about small and less than desirable rooms at the Palmer. Our room was more than adequate. Perhaps when the hotel is near capacity you might find yourself in one of these small rooms. But, the hotel seems to have just finished a major renovation from my research. I would just request a large renovated king room and I bet you will be satisfied. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and a great treat if you happen to secure it through priceline/hotwire.'
5,'Fantastic stay','Arrived here from another hotel during the travel disruptions from the volcano. Very helpful and pleasant staff. While rooms are a teeny little bit dated, overall a really great stay. Ate in the restaurant and the staff here were brilliant, and the food just delicious Very close to Central Park. Would definitely stay here again.'
5,Awesome!,'My wife and I stayed for one night in one of the suites to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Never have we felt more special than at this hotel. The main room measured about 50 by 20 and included a wet bar. Talk about space--there were two bathrooms and four closets! From the moment we checked in, every single member of the staff went out of their way to make our stay there the best. And it was.'
4,'would recommend thie edison','would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting new york. the recommendation of a refurbished room was great advise by another user. a little out dated but as long as you don\'t require all the fluff of a upscale hotel you will be satisfied. everything the hotel had to plan for us went smooth and with out a hitch(transportation, tickets, advise...ect.). if you want some good deals definently visit china town, and never give the asking price there, the will barter with you. and the subway is not scary as portrayed, would recommend buying all day ticket.'
5,'excellent location','Location is great. Rooms recently renovated. Comfortable beds. Very useful Kitchen in the room. The only negative was no free WiFi in the rooms , you have to step out the hotel front door to get free Internet'
4,'Einfaches Hotel in bester Lage','Wir waren zum ersten Mal in New York.\r\nUm 14.00 Uhr Ortszeit sind wir im Hotel angekommen. Das Personal an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Um 15.00 Uhr waren unsere Zimmer fertig. Am Empfang befanden sich zu dieser Zeit wenige wartende Gäste. Zu anderen Tageszeiten war es schon manchmal sehr voll. Aber das Hotel hat halt auch viele Zimmer. Die Zimmer waren angenehm groß (für 3 Personen), sauber, das Bad sehr einfach (10. Etage).\r\nDas Reinigungspersonal hat seinen Job gut gemacht. \r\nWas für eine tolle Lage. Kaum traten wir aus dem Hotel heraus, pulsierte das Leben auf der Straße im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes. Das Hotel liegt direkt an der U- Bahnstation. \r\nWir haben in diesem Hotel 5 Nächte unter normalen Verhältnissen verbracht (Ich glaube auch, zu wissen, was der Durchschnittsbürger als normal empfindet).\r\nIn dieser Zeit wurden wir auch Dank der tollen Lage des Hotels mit unendlich vielen Aktivitäten und Eindrücken belohnt (Stadtrundfahrt, Nachtfahrt, Bootsfahrt, Shopping , Wallstreet usw. ) . \r\nEin Kompliment an die New Yorker Polizei. So viele Menschen auf der Straße im Griff zu behalten, aller Achtung, aber es funktioniert. \r\nFazit: Wir haben, bezugnehmend auf die schlechten Bewertungen, mit unseren Zimmern vielleicht Glück gehabt , aber c\'est la vie, so ist das Leben.\r\nDanke NEW York und seine Bewohner, für die schöne Zeit!!!'
4,'Perfect Location','I stayed here with my auntie during a short trip to New York. The hotel is right in the heart of Times Square and a few steps from where the tour buses leave, so you can\'t really go wrong! We stayed in a standard twin room, and although it was next door to the ice maker on our floor (very noisy) you couldn\'t hear anything from the room at all. \r\nCheck-in was smooth and quick. The room was clean with coffee/tea making facilities and good sized bathroom.\r\nOnly slight complaint is that I accidentally left three expensive skirts and a dress in the wardrobe, but the hotel made no effort to contact me about these. I sent an email but got no reply so I never did get to recover them. My fault for forgetting them though I guess!'
4,'A cozy mix of New York chic and Rivendell serene','We came to New York on our honeymoon, and decided on Hudson Hotel, a decision we would not come to regret one iota.\r\nFrom always courteous and skilled employees, to very good breakfast and dinner, the surroundings were most certainly to our liking. The lobby reminded me strongly of my mental images of Tolkien\'s Rivendell, and the empty picture frames of the restaurant came to life with projected TV images, all creating a nice atmosphere.\r\nThe rooms are admittedly very much on the small side, and there is no closetspace for unpacking, forcing you to live out of your suitcase.\r\nComplimentary wireless service is included, but is spotty in some of the rooms, which meant I spent a bit of time in the lobby to get online.\r\nI would happily go back, but not for any longer than five days.'
3,'A 5 passi da Times Square','Siamo stati nell\'albergo una settimana nelle vacanza di Capodanno!! Albergo un po datato, con camere piccole e bagni piccoli! Noi abbiamo trovato la camera pulita e un personale disponibile e gradevole al contrario di alcuni che anno scritto che si sono trovati male!! La lobby abbastanza accogliente, con tanto di sicurezza che controlla gli ingressi agli ascensori! Sei ascensori! Possibilità di usare internet e stampante, centro informazioni turistiche, piccolo negozio di souvenirs e bar per la colazione! Noi non avevamo la colazione compresa quindi siamo sempre andati fuori a farla! Subito fuori dall\'altro lato della strada ce uno Starbucks e su time square sulla 43 possibilità di fare colazione all\'americana all\'Europa Cafe! Insomma hotel con un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo e comodissimo per girare la città! Unica nota: albergo un po datato con camere e bagni molto piccoli!!'
3,'There are much better choices','The best thing I can say about this hotel was the restaurant on premises..fabulous food..enormous portions and excellent prices. Other than that..the hotel itself was rather disappointing in that the room was simply average for the price..with the furnishings merely average and the bathroom painfully lacking in counter space..the shower curtain smelled musty. They were generous with the towels..however the most annoying part were the elevators whereby if you stayed on a lower floor..you had to take one elevator to get to your room..then get in and exit that elevator in order to get another elevator to gain access to the Executive Floors where the continental breakfast and cocktail hour were held. These functions were nice and I must say had a very nice offerring of breakfast items as well as some commanding views of the City.\r\nWe would not stay here again when we discovered many, smaller boutique type hotels with similar rates and far more inviting amenities and charm.'
2,'Wretched. Considering the cost!','I was here for a conference, but stayed two extra days. Although I was a Hilton Honors member, and booked early, I was given a room in \'steerage\' class. \r\nWhen I checked in, I was asked of I would forgo housekeeping for one day (in the name of the \'environment\') for some extra HiltonHonors bonus points. I agreed. Well, we had three days with no housekeeping, and NO bonus points. We never received the promised newspaper. There was usually a maid\'s cart parked outside our door. Which turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we often had to help ourselves to coffee and clean towels.\r\nMy companion left three days before I did. He booked an airport shuttle at the Bell desk. They wouldn\'t allow me to do that. I had to book through the travel desk (it took two tries) and pay twice as much.\r\nIf you want to pay Hilton prices, and receive Motel 6 service.... stay here! Otherwise, keep looking!\r\nOh, well, it is a good location...'
4,'Nice rooms, slow elevators','Kind staff, gorgeous lobby, clean spacious rooms...but elevators somewhat slow. Average wait for us was around 5 minutes for an elevator, which wasnt so bad, but brother reported waiting 20 minutes for an elevator around 11pm while trying to get to the fitness room, and I overheard some people in the elevators also experiencing a similar lengthy wait. Still a lovely hotel which I wouldn\'t mind staying at again, but just be mindful of the elevators and avoid using them during peak hours.'
3,'HIMMEL ODER HÖLLE auf 20 Etagen unter einem Dach','DAS HOTEL IST SO EXTREM WIE NEW YORK SELBST-\r\nIch war 6 mal dort von 2000-2006- Es gibt total neue und total schrottige Zimmer- Einmal hatte ich ein Zimmer so wie auf den Schock Fotos hier und auf Anfrage habe ich SOFORT und ohne discussion ein besseres bekommen.\r\nDie corner Rooms bieten wirklich sensationelle Aussichten \r\nauf Empire state usw aber dort sind die Bäder nicht immer neu-\r\nMein Tip als Paar auf Honeymoon einchecken und ggf SOFORT REKLAMIEREN- das zieht immer\r\nüberignds die LAGE ÜBERTRIFFT ALLES ZENTRALER GEHT WIRKLICH NICHT als gegenüber von Pennstation'
4,'Elegant and functional','Stayed here for a business meeting which was within walking distance of the hotel. The lobby is grand, beautifully restored and impressive. I was on one of the executive level floors (22) and found the express elevator to be a great time-saver. The extras on these floors included evening appetizers and a wonderful morning breakfast! The room itself was quite large and beautifully decorated. Unfortunately, the bathroom was very compact and had bits of wallpaper peeling away. The staff were all friendly, ready with a smile and incredibly helpful. The fee for the gym (while small at $10 per day) seemed a bit silly although the facility itself was fantastic. The spa was fully booked unfortunately, so I didn\'t get to experience a much-needed massage. Overall, while I believe the overall rate to be a bit high, I would stay again.'
5,'Hotel eccellente!!!','Tutto perfetto!Hotel in ottima posizione (con possibilità di raggiungere a piedi i principali luoghi di interesse!), bellissima struttura, camere pulite e confortevoli, servizio ottimo!Ad onor del vero le camere sono un pò piccole, ma nuove e ben arredate (a differenza di quanto sostenuto da altri utenti di tripadvisor, devo dire che, nonostante le dimensioni ristrette della camera, lo spazio è stato ben sfruttato ed è stato ricavato anche un angolo per i bagagli!).Ho gradito molto, poi, la possibilità di fare il check out autonomamente (attraverso il menù della TV!), senza dover passare per la reception (con evidente risparmio di tempo)!!!Assolutamente consigliato!'
5,'fantastic location','I took my daughter to NYC for just a quick weekend to celebrate her golden birthday (11). I picked the Crowne Plaza for location but the price was fantastic too! It took awhile for them to get a room for us at checkin..we had to check back a couple of times but the lady at the desk gave us a great room. We had a corner that overlooked Time Square and it was the best! We did that red bus tour and there was a stop right by us plus everything was in walking distance. Would definitely stay there again.'
1,'Don\'t be fooled by the website! Worst hotel I\'ve ever stayed in!','I saw photos of the website and thought this looked like a nice little boutique style hotel to stay in, right near Central Park. The ONLY good thing about this hotel is the location 2 blocks south of the park. However there are many other hotels in the same area that are a thousand times better like the Sheraton NY. This hotel looks old and is very depressing. The service is the worst I have EVER had and I would tell anyone reading this to run as far as you can from this pit!\r\nThe service at this hotel was so bad, I am having trouble remembering ALL of the problems. Here are a few:\r\n1. Upon check in -no one smiles and the ladies at the front desk are rude. Evelyn was so rude, that my extremely mild-mannered colleague about flew off the handle.\r\n2. Every day after the room was cleaned we had to call to get towels, toilet paper, kleenex and glasses. The only thing they did was make up the bed. And often had to call up to 3 times, waiting around and they never came up with the missing items.\r\n3. Went to change rooms because ours had so many problems and was on one of the lowest floors, which are usually the worst. After being told it was no problem, went downstairs and Evelyn said it would be $3.50 per bag to store our bags until the new room opened up...first of this news. Later when we returned, NO ONE blocked a room for us and stuck talking to the awful Evelyn again, she said they didn\'t really have double beds above the 8th floor - YEAH RIGHT! New room had barely working AC.\r\n4. We were there for a trade show and the staff had never heard of it (the biggest of its kind in the country) and finally we saw a sign about it hidden in the back alley that gave the wrong location for shuttle pickup.\r\n5. HERE\'s the topper....\r\nWe reserved a house car to get to the airport on our final day. They said it was all set for us and they take credit cards. Next morning, we went down and it was not there for 25 minutes. Then the driver who finally showed up got into a car accident on the way. A car hit the side right next to me. The driver NEVER apologized or asked if we were okay. It took over 45 minutes for a replacement to show, who also never apologized. We were almost an hour and half late to the airport, shaken from the accident, and still no apology...and they had the balls to charge us for the trip! Best part - the guy insisted we go inside the airport to get cash because he wouldn\'t take a credit card!! After they assured us they would. Then he finally said he would for a 10\% fee!!!!\r\nOne closing word, if any manager from the hotel reads this - you MUST talk to your staff about service...it is appalling. Also, what is with the elevator assignments ---what is the point? There are only 2 elevators for the lower floors and it doesn\'t know how many people are boarding it per floor, so it doesn\'t help. In fact, every single time I was on there, multiple people couldn\'t get off at their floor and didn\'t know why. The small sign explaining this procedure, that offers no value, was in English and most of the customers are European...think about it!'
1,'Frustrated beyond belief','We had a terrible experience at the Palmer House. Upon check in 1 of our 3 rooms was ready on the 9th floor, we were told the other two would be on the 9th & 13th floors. I double checked to make sure we would not get one of the infamous 10x10 rooms and were assured no we wouldn\'t. After receiving a text that another room was ready we check in to that room, now on the 10th floor and were told the other would be on the 10th floor, I again was assured that the third would be a normal size room and not a cell as they had all the credit card information and were putting a hold on our room to assure it wasn\'t. Having plans for the day we departed and upon getting back at 10 pm, finally got our 3rd room\'s keys... Guess what?? It was a 10x10 room. Calling down to the front desk got zero results, they were sold out, no apology, no reduction in room rate, just a too bad, so sad attitude. We had stayed at the Marriott the night before and regret moving to the Palmer House. I was extremely upset given that we are HHonors members, not sure why, doesn\'t do you any good.'
5,'Beautiful Hotel with great service!!','Loved the Hotel and the staff was great with recommendations, Thanks Again see you soon.'
4,'good location','just literally off times square. Last hotel on our round trip, similar to the milford plaza, bit dated but slightly more updated, flat screen tv and bathroom had been retiled etc.\r\ncomfortable room clean thats all you need in new york somewhere comfortable to sleep. Bit pricey but for the one night worth it to be in that location. Good transportation booking service to airport which gets one worry out of the way.All in all not bad.'
4,'a moin d\'une minute a pied de time square!','J\'ai séjourner la bas en tout 6 jours. c\'est très propre..la douche a un jet super puissant mais peu changer de température subitement pour une dizaine de seconde..insonoriser des voisin mais pas des sirènes des pompiers et police..ni du camion de poubelle qui passe tôt le matin! pas de réfrigérateur ..le personnel courtois , un restaurant au rez de chaussé et un depaneur 24h . le prix est resonnable et l\'emplacement est du plus idéale !'
1,'Stay AWAY!','This hotel is situated in Chicago, very good location, but a pity about the hotel. We were not advised when booking of the 3 day music festival going on during our stay. When we arrived on a Saturday evening, the hotel lobby was PACKED with people, drinking, loud and sitting everywhere. The security didnt seem to know how to handle it. There were crowds carrying beer crates all around the lobby. Having requested rooms near each other as we were 1 family of 6 travelling together, we were advised the only way to have rooms near each other was to upgrade on room to a Queen, free of charge, bt the other was $19 extra per day. We agreed to this as otherwise we would have been separated.We then waited 30 minutes for an elevator (no exaggeration) and when we got to the rooms, the Queen room was very small, and the bed was in no way Queen size. There was a horrible smell of damp in the room, and stains on the carpet.The other room stank of cigaratte smoke, even though it was a no smloking floor. Despite complaints nothing was done. We were also chaged $62 per day parking, and nly discovered from another guest that you could self park for $42 per day! There were empty drink cans and glasses and cigarette butts everywhere, and any journey in the elevators took ages, on average 20minutes. This did NOT improve after the music festival ended.\r\nWe complained to the staff, who although very polite, were completey disinterested, and did nothing to help. On checking out, we were not even asked about our stay. I overheard 2 other guests complaing both about the smell and darkness in their room,and the condition of the lobby. This hotel is NOT worth the extra money for a supposedly 4 star hotel. My advice is to stay away from it. Choose the Ritz Carlton instead, they know how to look after guests.'
4,'Convenient Location','Just 1/2 block from Times Square, good restaurants within walking distance, subways are just 3 blocks away and theatres are 2-3 blocks away. Rooms are okay, nothing fancy, and the rates are okay for NYC. A reasonably priced restaurant is adjacent to the lobby. Staff is friendly.'
4,'Park Central - A Good Stay','My buddy & I spent 6 hrs. @ our local coffee house reviewing hotels on various sites for our trip to NYC. My friend & I booked a 6-day stay (12/17-12/22) at the Park Central; many reviews were great, other were hate, but we\'d give it a shot. \r\nWe arrived, we\'re greeted by Saleem, a friendly counter clerk. He was fast, polite & answered all our questions. We got to our room (#1029), (2) double-beds, facing the dreaded center core of the bldg. (no view which is often the norm in NY from what I\'m told) & the faceplate on the closet safe had been torn off; so couldn\'t use the safe, which we needed. \r\nI called & spoke to a rep, requesting another room due to the safe issue; she said there weren\'t any. My friend called & spoke to a man who understood the problem, he patched us thru to Customer Manager. My friend explained having to use the Concierge safe was impractical. The CM said they did have another room; come down to the desk. We did & Wa-lah, Saleem had us in another room (#1119) in a New York minute. \r\nWe get to our new room; again double beds, slightly larger with a view of the city, a fridge & a safe that worked. We discovered the TV did not work. We called & in 5 minutes a maintenance rep showed up & fixed the problem in a jiffy; back plug was out of the set. Each day our room was cleaned & all our questions were answered by the staff. They were all polite to us. I needed to print some itinerary stuff & they promptly directed us to the Business Center. We\'d leave our room and the housekeepers were all smiles and wished a good day.\r\nThe one draw back is the new elevator system; you enter your floor on a keypad & it assigns an elevator. One problem, it doesn\'t ask the # in your party, so as folks arrive to the elevators, everyone is assigned the same one. You\'d have 20 folks to one elevator which doesn\'t work out well. We had one overloaded and it ground it\'s way to the lobby. They are still working the kinks on this. As we reached the lobby one morning, there were some suits standing & chatting; turns out the elevator company.\r\nHaving experience in Risk Management I later contacted the hotel on my return home and spoke to the manager who works with the elevator service. I identified some flaws in the system; that while it was great to push your floor and be assigned a particular car, everyone was being assigned the same car, out of 4 elevators. Additionally, the same keypad is out in the front lobby, allowing bored kids to push buttons, or adults to push their floor, but then be side tracked and not use the elevator. Once a floor is picked on the keypad, it automatically lights up the button in the elevator. So, if many folks don\'t show up, the remaining passengers are left to stop on floors where no one is getting off.\r\nSince the system doesn\'t ask for # of passengers in your group, the Hotel is overloading the elevator. From a Risk Management point of view, were they prepared to be sued when one elevator, being overweight, snaps free or just shuts down trapping folks. You could hear a pin drop. The rep actually heard what I said, took notes and asked if it was okay to contact me for follow up questions or thoughts. Hey, sure, why not.\r\nThe Park Central is not the Ritz Carlton, which I have stayed in other cities, even here in SF, and was not impressed. Now, the InterContinental impresses me anytime. But anyway, The Park Central is and older hotel, but I found it clean, remodeled on our floors, the Business Center, Gym area and others. The lobby was nice and truly everyone was pleasant to us and accommodated us quickly.\r\nDon\'t eat at the hotel restaurant; THE LINE IS JUST TOO LONG FOR AVERAGE FOOD. Go over to the Brooklyn Diner or Europa down the block, great food and good prices.\r\nAnother tip I tell all; TIP YOUR HOUSEKEEPER DAILY. Don\'t assume you have the same housekeeper each day. Many folks tip the last day or when they pay. You\'re assuming the HK getting all the tip on the last day will share or even if that HK was the one that cleaned your room all week. Plus you assume the Hotel will pass the money along to housekeeping. I was given this tip years ago and it has resulted in; returning in the evening with the bed turned down and chocolates on my pillow, larger towels, a bath robe, better toiletries, extra blanket, flowers on the table, and my belongings always stayed put. I even once found my dirty clothes laundered.\r\nThis trip, we tipped each day, and we\'d return to Thank You notes, wishing us well, thanking us for our generosity & with God Bless, and we got newer larger bath towels (though not necessary as we opted for the clean choice; same linens for stay to reduce water use) These folks don\'t get paid well and they do a lot, so return the favor and ensure your HK get\'s their tip.\r\nAll in all, it was a nice stay at the Park Central. I would recommend it as it\'s close to everything, clean, polite staff, etc.'
4,'Small Room, no view, but great location','We stayed two days at the Affinia Manhattan. To be fair, we booked last minute and booked the least expensive room (Queen room). The room was very small (as are most in NYC). The only window was small and high, which offered no real view. That being said, it was not a bad place to stay for the price. The rooms were clean, as was the rest of the hotel (quite nice for a small boutique hotel). The location was great, near the fur district, and neighborhoods, so you get a feel for the less touristy NYC. Right across the street from Penn Station so it was convenient for getting around by subway and on foot. Would recommend upgrading to a king room....'
5,Faboulous,'Elegance, smooth ambience, professional and warm hospitality. Central and so well connected to the main sites. The rooms are cozy and warm , everything excellent. Two steps away from Columbus Center and Fifth Avenue. The Hall is fantastic and unique.'
4,'Great value for money - excellent location.','The New Yorker really represents great value for money and it\'s location is hard to beat especially for first time visitors to the city. The subway is right outside, Times Square, Empire State Building & Macy\'s are a 5-10 minute walk away & the 24 hour \'Tick Tock\' diner attached to the hotel is handy for breakfast. We had a room on the 36th floor with a view of Madison Square Gardens. The room was fairly small but not bad for New York, the small cupboard was handy for storing cases & came with an iron & ironing board. The bathroom also has a hairdryer which is handy! Check in staff were helpful & efficient. You take your own bags to your room which I liked as you aren\'t then under pressure to tip & you feel more relaxed. The hotel has a fitness centre which could be handy.When we were stranded due to the Volcano the hotel were extremely helpful, they allowed us to keep our bags in our existing room until 4pm until we knew whether or not we would need the room & we extended our stay at the same nightly rate (rather than hiking up the prices). The location is busy with lots going on directly outside the hotel but if you want everything on the doorstep & ask for a room rond the back of the hotel you will enjoy your stay. Would definitely stay here again.'
4,'Wonderful Stay.','We all have different expectations when it comes to hotels. My wife and I stayed at The Park Central in late January. As others have said, the locations was absolutely great. Unlike others, however, our stay was fine. No staff member was rude, the concierge went out of thier way to help us, the room was very clean, and there were never lines for the elevators. I even spoke to the person who was to clean our room and she was very kind. I left a tip every day and our room was cleaned to above most standards. We didn\'t use the restaurant or the bar, so I can\'t comment on them. Overall, no, it isn\'t a five star hotel, but I wasn\'t paying five star prices either. take the comments with a grain of salt and don\'t be affraid to stay at the Park Central. It was a very pleasant stay.'
3,'Not what it was.......','I stayed here recently on business for three nights. Location is great and was perfect location for my business. The room was large for New York with a nice bathroom and tv etc. I was disappointed with room service ad service from staff generally. Would I go back, yes if the price was right if not I would try elsewhere.'
3,'Bien situado','Buenas tardes:\r\nNo es mal hotel para lo que hay en nueva York, pero en España no pasaría de ser un hotel de una o dos estrellas. Sus habitaciones son antiguas y la zona del desayuno es pequeña. \r\nNo obstante, la relación calidad-precio-situación en la ciudad es buena.\r\nSi vuelvo a nueva York, casi seguro que será a este hotel.'
1,'Awful Service after 27hrs of travel','We had a group of seven people stay at Hotel Pennsylvania from for two nights We had two rooms book, 4 people in one room and 3 people in the other room.\r\nWe checked it after 27hrs hours of traveling at 1am and of course were exhausted and the lady at the counter had no idea what she was doing. She was completely confused and so were we. It took well over 30mins to check in. \r\nShe took our passports and had to keep doing the same thing with them because she was distracted and wasn\'t paying attention as she was partly on the phone while checking us in.\r\nIt wasn’t busy; we were the only ones there so she has no excuse for being incompetent. They rooms we booked were not cleaned so they gave us an extra room. (I don’t understand why the room was not ready when we arrived at 1am in the morning, there should have been ample time to get it ready). She didn\'t tell us where to go or what level we were on. We got to the rooms and there was only enough beds for 6 people, not 7. We had to check each room, all in different levels lugging our luggage around to try and find which room had the extra bed hidden. Eventually we gave up and didn\'t want to go complain because she was useless. Three of us just slept in the king bed for both nights. The other thing was our window was open so our room was freezing as it was about to snow the next day.\r\nWe got three keys for one of the rooms and two of them didn\'t work and the door wouldn\'t shut properly so this was another inconvenience.\r\nI also asked the lady at check in if there would be any charge or on hold money when she took our credit card numbers. She said no. One of the cards got charged $40 and has been returned to her now but I was charged $267.70 and it has not been returned. I called the accountants twice now and no one can tell me why I was charged this amount. It\'s a very random number, when we checked out they said there was no extra charges for extra services.\r\nWe were very unhappy with our stay at Hotel Pennsylvania and higher standards were expected of the hotel and hope that no one else has to go through what we did.'
3,'Disappointing visit','Having stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past I was extremely disappointed on this visit after recommending the hotel to friends. The staff were very unhelpful and not very friendly and the rooms appear to be getting smaller. On previous stays I have always had two double beds so I am not sure if I got a different room type but the one bedroom rooms are very small and uncomfortable and if you wanted tea or coffee you had to ask housekeeping to bring you a machine and coffee rather than it just being in the room anyway. The location is great for the hotel and when in new york your not in your room anyway so I suppose its no big deal about the room size it was more the staff issue that put me off.'
1,'I\'ll never go back','We came into NY for the Big East and wanted to stay next to MSG and Penn Station. We got what we asked for up to that point and then it ended.\r\nThe check in took more then 45 minutes. Once we got to our room we were shocked at how dirty and run down the hotel was. The room had pant falling off the walls and ceiling. The furniture was old and falling apart. The bath room was well BAD. I will never stay there again. I felt like warning others that were checking in to run but bite my tongue.'
3,'start spreadin\' the news','We stayed in room 851 from Oct. 29 to Nov. 4, \'09. No major problems. We were in town for the marathon. A few small items. We get it about the lobby remodel being cutting edge and with it, but get rid of the crappy music. This happens a lot: millions put into a remodel and no thought at all into the music. Turn it down and how about some jazz, big band, or oldies?. Next, we had to call three times for a coffee pot and they didn\'t charge us, like they should have. Bathroom mold: just give each housekeeper a bottle of Tylex to spray on the moldy caulking. Reall simple, and it would make a difference. The free apples at the desk were a nice touch. \r\nWe liked the hotel, the elevators, the location, the price. We would stay again, gladly.'
4,'Nice hotel, great location','We stayed here for a long weekend over Easter. The main reason for our stay was shopping. We spent 4 nights all of which were paid for using Priority Club points so it is hard to comment on value for money.\r\nSo the location is fantastic. This is as central as central gets although Times Square is very very busy day and night so expect big crowds.\r\nUpon check in we were given a room on the 21st floor which was an accessible room right next to the lifts. Whilst the room was large, I was not keen on having my headboard next to the lift wall. I then discovered that the room had no safe so returned to reception.\r\nThey explained to me that they had just undergone a refit (as others have said) and that they are waiting on safes for some of the rooms but that this is not a problem and after a couple of minutes of tapping on the computer we were given keys to a room on the 45th floor.\r\nWe did notice later that evening that the queues at the reception desk were huge so it looks like we arrived just in time.\r\nSo the room was an OK size with an OK view (we were at the back of the hotel with views towards the Hudson), a nice bathroom and a large LCD TV. There was the usual coffee machine in the room, the bed was comfy and overall, there was nothing to complain about. This was very much the standard you come to expect from Crowne Plaza around the world.\r\nWe only drank and ate in the bar on the first evening and whilst the drinks were expensive (as you expect them to be in a hotel bar), the bar snacks were reasonable for the quantity and quality delivered.\r\nWe did not eat in the hotel at any other time.\r\nThere is a Starbucks directly across the road (and just up the road and just down the road and just round the corner) as well as loads of places to eat and drink within staggering distance.\r\nThere is also an Irish bar literally next to the hotel front door that seemed to have a permanent happy hour and was welcoming and not bad on price.\r\nSo overall this delivered exactly what I would have expected a Crowne Plaza hotel to deliver. This is a very large (46 floors) modern city hotel in a fantastic location and a great base to explore from.\r\nI would certainly consider using this hotel if I were to return'
4,'Worth the price','I wanted to provide a quick review since I\'ve started using Trip Advisor as part of my travel planning. Hotel is reasonably priced for what you get, and is located between Times Square and Central Park, within walking distance of both. Good cab service in this part of NYC, so we left the car with the valet and the bags with the hotel ($3 per piece) when we arrived early afternoon. Got 50\% show tickets at the TKTS booth in Times Square, and then had a quick bite to eat prior to the matinee. When we arrived back at the hotel around 6pm, our room was ready and we had no problems getting settled in and then having a great dinner using Zagat\'s, Michellen and gayot to find the kind of restaurant you don\'t have back at home. Checkout was 12 noon the next day, so no rush getting out of the hotel for us. Turned out to be a nice visit to NYC, although from the looks of some of the people sitting in the lobby they either had nothing to do until the 4pm check-in time, and even afterwards. NYC is a good place to have some plans before your arrive, since there are hundreds of options once you get there but this hotel does a pretty good job of putting you in the middle of things. Good luck!'
2,'Location great, Hotel reasonable, Staff rude, Prices ridiculous','Business-wise I have several to New York and always stayed in the top range business hotels in the financial district. As we went Xmas shopping this time and it was the first trip for my wife to the B.A. we decided to book a hotel a bit more central and chose to stay in the Crown Plaza at Time Square.\r\nIf only I had read Tripadvisor before booking, as I normally do.....The almost complete lack of reponse by the management about all the negative reviews would would have told me that they just don\'t care what customers think about the hotel and its quality. The stupid tourist will come anway is probably the school of thought here.\r\nWe stayed at the Concierge Tower on the 44th floor and had every morning breakfast at the Longe on th 46th, when we asked for a few slides of bread to toast the staff - irritated while we disturbed them at their coffee - told us that we only had continental breakfast which doesn\'t include bread. Just an example, like we can tell about the horrible attitude of the lady at the bar downstairs, the rude approach at the reception and concierge. Two exemptions: the great Colombian guy that stood outside in the snow arranging taxi\'s for us all the time and Denise the most helpful concierge one can imagine.\r\nWith all the hotels in the neigbourhood as alternatives...... DONT GO HERE!!'
5,'Definitely would stay again.','Beautiful hotel, walking distance to most everything, clean,and fun. We stayed on one off the executive floors, we enjoyed a nice breakfast, and snacks dudring the day, along with happy hour from 5-7pm. Thanks Palmer House!'
4,'Better than I expected.','After reading the reviews I feared the worst. But I can honestly say the hotel exceeded my expectations. Sure, some of the hotel was a bit shabby in places, but the room was clean, fresh towels everyday and the staff were helpful and polite. The location is fantastic, within a five minute walk of Times Square, 5th Ave. and the ESB. We had a fantastic holiday and a pleasant stat here.'
2,'Feil klasse','Hotellet fortjener ikke 4 stjerner, knapt 3. Rommet var lite og for lite for 2 personer i såkalt luksusrom. Rommet mangler f.eks. glass til å drikke av, minibar eller annet utstyr. Badet er miniatyr med et speil på 30x50cm noe som gjør sminke og morgenstell til et sjansespill. Badet virket skittent og slitt. Toalettsetet dinglet. Flott beliggenhet, flott resepsjon og betjening. I norsk forstand minte hotellet om et ungdomsherberge.'
3,'good value... nothing special','I stayed with my boyfriend at this hotel only for one night near Valentine\'s Day to celebrate. It just have a very large/modern feel, and not really any personal warmth. I met him later after he had already checked in, and when I walked into the hotel, no one greeted me or offered any help. It\'s not that I need to be greeted, but it is the little personal touches that makes a hotel stand out. The whole staff seemed busy, pleasant, but never welcoming or warm. It took awhile for me to find the right elevator to our room (because the lobby is huge) and I just felt like I was one of the crowd, not there to have a great experience. After dinner, we came back to the hotel around midnight or 1am, and everything had already shut down in the hotel. For a hotel bar in NY to already be dark at 1am on Thursday, it seemed a little weird. Also, room service wasn\'t available 24 hours so if we wanted food, we\'d have to order elsewhere. They wouldn\'t even deliver a wine bottle or any drinks after the kitchen closed. Last call in NY is 4am and it was just annoying that we couldn\'t get a bottle to the room at 1:30am to continue celebrating the holiday. I know that may not seem like a big deal, but for a NY hotel in the times square area, I feel it is just expected to have 24 hour in-room dining. The room itself was way bigger than I had expected. We had a living room and a bedroom, both a decent size not even by NY standards. However, besides location and room size, there is nothing too special about the hotel. For the room alone, after all the NY taxes, it was roughly around $500 which I feel there are way better hotel experiences in the area for that price range.'
3,'Buena situación, precio razonable para Nueva York, poco mas','Elegí este hotel porque me pareció que era el que tenía los precios más razonables (dentro de lo caro que es un hotel en Manhattan) y porque estaba bien situado. La situación es inmejorable. Está en la séptima avenida, justo delante del Madison Square Garden y a poca distancia de Times Square y muy poquita del Empire State Building.\r\nHacer el check in es un poco pesado porque siempre hay mucha gente haciendo cola y te puedes tirar fácilmente media hora esperando.\r\nEl hotel está un poco ruinoso, y lo que es especialmente llamativo son las puertas, que parecen tapas de ataud!!! es flipante jajaja. Pero bueno, teniendo en cuenta que al final el hotel en una ciudad como Nueva York, solo lo quieres para dormir, tampoco supone un gran trauma. Prefiero sacrificar esas cosillas, mientras esté limpio y bien situado.\r\nNosotros nos alojamos en 2 estancias distintas porque fuimos un día a Niágara, y a la vuelta tuvimos un problemilla con la habitación. Habíamos contratado una habitación doble con 2 camas, y nos encontramos una habitación con una cama individual. Bajé a protestar, y nos cambiaron la habitación sin problemas, pero tuve que estar otra hora en la maldita cola después de haber aguantado media hora para la primera habitación!!!\r\nTeníamos el desayuno incluído, pero la cafetería es bastante lamentable. Es como si fuera una habitación más, pero tiene un par de mesas con ordenador y 3 mesas (nunca supe si había una sala de estas por piso, pero si esta era la única cafetería para todo el edificio, es bastante fuerte). Hay una máquina tipo nespresso (pero no es una nespresso, es una marca lapava) que sirve cafés supercalientes estilo americano, y una tostadora con mundo por delante. Pero bueno, siendo positivos, salías habiendo comido algo, pero no era ningún gran desayuno.\r\nResumiendo, si solo quieres estar por la ciudad y usar el hotel para dormir sin tener que pagar una barbaridad, este hotel te vendrá bien porque está bien situado y no es un robo a mano armada. Pero si prefieres que también disfrutar de la estancia en el hotel, búscate otro lugar y prepárate a tirar de tarjeta.'
5,'super ruidoso','El Hotel esta muy padre, muy moderno, pero el cuarto es super chiquito, muy ruidoso, los ruidos de la calle se filtran todos hacia el cuarto, pero si eso no te importa entonces el hotel esta super bueno, un antro muy inn, el restaurant poca madre, recomendado'
1,Disgusting,'I was attending a coference in another hotel which unfortunately was full and this booking was made for me by the event planners.\r\nI arrived to stay 2 nights Tues 8th and Wed 9th May to be told that I had been booked in for the Wed 9th and Thurs 10th. I assured the unfriendly receptionist the booking was for the nights I stated and gave her the booking form but she said she could give me a room for Tuesday night for $499 or come back tomorrow and stay the two nights the hotel had me booked in for. I was adamant their booking was incorrect. I then had to go and buy an internet access card to print off the rest of the paperwork. After standing in line again for another 30 mins, I handed over the paperwork to be told the booking was for 8th & 9th May 2008. The booking was not going to be changed unless I paid another $150 per night to take it to $499 I had been offered if I wanted to stay. I asked for the manager and the girl disappeared with all the papers. She surfaced 10 mins later and said they would change it as it was their mistake. I was given a key for room 211 - this was the most disgusting room I have ever seen and went straight back down to be moved. The other room was better but still dirty and very tatty. I had to call security to get the window closed at it was stuck half open. On returning to my room on the second day I could not get in as the security latch was on from the inside. Once again I called security who showed up 40 minutes later and told me it was easy to break through the locks......very reassuring. It is the only hotel I have ever stayed at that I locked everything in my suitcase before going out. \r\nAnother person I met had booked in there and been given the key to a room that had not been serviced. The second room he was given was the same and on seeing the third room, left the hotel and went elsewhere.\r\nI understand for many people a hotel is just a base as they are out all day. Paying $350 per night, the hotel should be more than a base and it should offer good security and be clean. The towels and floor mat all had holes in them and were grubby. The soundproofing was terrible and I could clearly hear the person next door in the bathroom.'
1,'very bad service','The agents were not helpful, friendly, or caring. The check in was not welcoming at all. The room smelled bad, and the concierge was interested in his computer more than he was of the people in front of him.'
4,'Super Preis-Leistung!','Das grosse Hotel hat eine tolle zentrale Lage, für die Preisklasse wirklich sehr gut. Es ist ein schönes, klssisch altes Hotel. Alles von Verkehrsmitteln bis Shopping/Erlebnis in der Nähe.\r\nZimmer war einfach, aber sauber und ordentlich. Gute Matratzen und mit guten Schutzbezügen unter dem Laken! Leider waren die Wände zum Nachbarn sehr dünn, so dass alle Geräusche zu hören waren. Das Gute aber: kaum Strassenlärm, obwohl es an der 7th Avenue liegt!\r\nDer Service am Empfang war höflich, wirkte jedoch etwas unstrukturiert, bzw. unorganisiert was bei der wenigen Zahl der Angestellten dort leider ins Gewicht fiel. Zum Glück gab es aber nur eine Schlange der Wartenden (die dafür aber teilweise sehr lang war). Zum Auschecken stand dort zum Glück einfach ein Kasten für den Quick-Checkout zum Einwerfen der Zimmerkarten. Kofferaufbewahrungs Möglichkeit im Keller. Leider kein Service der Flugbestätigung einen Tag vor dem Abflug. (Vielleicht in New York nicht üblich)\r\nInsgesamt ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis aber super. Das Hotel ist auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen.'
4,'Rundum zufrieden!','Das Park Central ist eine empfehlenswerte Adresse in New York. Keine 7 Minuten zum Times Square oder dem Central Park ist die Lage fast optimal. Der Service im Hotel ist gut, die Menschen sind freundlich und hilfsbereit, die Zimmer absolut OK. \r\nWir würden dieses Hotel immer wieder wählen.'
4,'Good Solid Hotel','We stayed at Affinia Manhattan for 7 nights at the end of March/start of April \'09. We actually only stayed 6 nights as our first night we were delayed in LA and didn\'t make it to NY till the next day. \r\nThe hotel was exactly what we were expecting, grand lobby, dated rooms but nice and clean and a decent location for sightseeing for a first time visitor. We had a studio room (room 1918) on the 19th floor which was at the end of a corridor so no neighbours on one side. Room was large, one queen bed, desk and chair, arm chair, dated kitchen and a tiny but completely serviceable bathroom with fantastic water pressure in the shower! Room was very clean and kept clean during our stay.\r\nWe found the staff to all be very friendly and extremely helpful whenever you needed them. \r\nWe ate at Niles restaurant one night and really enjoyed our meal and drinks, we ate up at the bar farly early one night pre-theatre. Food was good and was reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.\r\nOn the whole Affinia Manhattan was what we were expecting and for a great price from Travelzoo ($119 weekend $149 weeknights). It was one of four NYC hotels we stayed in and even though it was older style it still measured up against more pricey accommodations in the Thompson group.\r\nWe would definitely reccommend it to anyone if you can get a good price like we did.'
4,'Nice hotel, busy ,but with a great location.','Location, location, location. \r\nIs all about the location, is a nice hotel for the location, reception always busy, nice bar scene at the lobby, at a corner where you can have a nice times square view.\r\nThe breakfast is nice, but don´t expect too much, you will find nice options of restaurants on a walking distance from the hotel.'
4,'Great Hotel in NYC','Stayed in this hotel from 30th June- 5th July 2012. The lobby is really nice and large. There is a door that goes straight out to 42nd Street. The lifts are fast (but if your room is high up, your ears might pop!!) It appears that lots of floors in the middle of the hotel are used as apartmements or offfices as the lift does not go to many floors. The rooms are nice and big. The TV is very good and it has a TV guide incase you don\'t know what number each channel is on. There are some flims and tv shows on the TV that you can watch at anytime, but they cost ALOT of money, so don\'t bother as you don\'t spend alot of time in your hotel in NYC anyway. The bathroom is nice and the shower is nice and hot. The room is cleaned daily and the cleaners are very good. We didn\'t eat in the hotel as food is REALLY expensive. I would recommend Pershing\'s Square just across the road for breakfast. Overall, the hotel is great, but just be aware of hidden charges. \r\nGOOD:'
4,'Great Stay at the Grand Hyatt','We booked our trip through the hotel website, and received a great rate through a Stay Four Nights package. The rates ranged from $139 to $169 per night. We couldn\'t believe we could get these rates in NYC! \r\nCheck-in was fairly smooth, and we received the room that we had booked. We were a little nervous about the noise after reading the reviews, so we booked a quiet room (rm 2428). The room was great! The view was the back of the hotel and surrounding buildings, which we were willing to sacrifice for a quiet room. We heard next to nothing from our neighbours, and very little street noise. We also requested a fridge, which they delivered a few hours after check-in. As it turned out, the electrical outlet for the fridge didn\'t work (at the time we thought the fridge didn\'t work), so requested a new one in the morning. When we returned in the afternoon, the fridge hadn\'t been replaced, so we called again. The new fridge was there when we returned again at 11:00 pm. I also checked the cleanliness of the bathroom when we arrived (a few negative reviews on bathrooms). The shower curtain was not moldy, my only complaint was a few hairs left in the tub and sink. There was an ironing board, but no iron in our room. It took about 15 minutes for them to get one to us. (Much faster than the fridge!!) Our room was cleaned well everyday.\r\nThe room was really large by NY standards. We stayed at the Doubletree in 07 and found both the room and bathroom to be much larger at the Hyatt. Although the bathroom was smallish, there were some shelves under the pedestal sink to put some stuff.\r\nWe never ate at the hotel since it seemed pricey and there are so many places to eat in NYC. Thanks to reading previous reviews, we were aware of the dining concourse at Grand Central. Also, fellow Canadian Tim Hortons fans, a Tim Hortons opened just down 42nd St.! (1-2 min walk west) Also, there is a Duane Reade across the street with some food and supplies (no produce though). \r\nCheck-out was great as well, we found the woman (Patty) to be extremely friendly and helpful.\r\nOverall, we were very pleased with our stay. It was a very nice hotel, and the price and location were hard to beat!!! Enjoy!'
4,'Very Good Location, Decent Hotel','The hotel itself is not really worth the price you pay, but the location is probably the best in the city. This hotel is connected to Grand Central Station, so it\'s very convenient to jump on the subway and get to anywhere in the city. It\'s only one stop away from Times Square(with a subway shuttle running until midnight) and from there you can get to all the tourist sights in the city. If you don\'t want to take the train, no problem, you can get to quite a few places within 20 minutes. The Empire State Building, Times Square, and Rockefeller Center is about 10 minutes. A walk to the east harbour and the United Nations building is also 10 minutes. A walk to Central Park is about 20 minutes, but you can walk down either 5th Avenue of Madison Avenue and take in the shopping on the way there. And if you want to go to a Yankees game, there a shuttle from Grand Central Station right to the stadium. As for the actual hotel, the lobby is nice and clean, the rooms are actually fairly large for New York, but nothing luxurious, just your basic hotel room. But you don\'t pay for the room, you pay for the location.'
4,'Great location!','We stayed at the Hilton for two (2) nights in June. We loved the location! The Hilton is about five (5) blocks from Central Park, close to the Theater District, and one block from the shopping along 5th Avenue. It made for an easy walk to all of the above. Be aware that this is a large and crowded hotel. The lobby reminded me of a train station with all the comings and goings and the elevators of a cruise ship with the frequent stops. \r\nThe Hilton was clean and the staff was friendly. We payed about $100 dollars a night extra to stay in the executive level rooms so we could have access to the executive lounge. The lounge was overflowing with people for breakfast and evening snacks. We didn\'t bother on the second morning because of a long line to get in the door. The breakfast consisted of mostly breads and cereals, not many choices for those of us on a low carb diet. Evening snacks consisted of california rolls, cheese and crackers, asian dumplings, and the smallest chicken wings I\'ve ever seen. They had four (4) beers on tap and five (5) or six (6) bottles of wine, also on tap. They use the honor system but almost no one was dropping the chits in the box. We suggest saving your $100 and going outside the hotel for meals and snacks, unless your a wine/beer drinker and you don\'t want to drop your chits. \r\nWe ate breakfast on the 2nd morning at the Hilton\'s market cafe. The buffet was $36 per person and there weren\'t too many choices. Definitely not worth the expense. Also, unless your a Hilton Honors Diamond Member, the wireless is $15.00 a day and unlike many other Hilton\'s the business center also charges for internet use. \r\nOverall, we enjoyed the stay and will return. On our next visit, we will reserve a basic room and plan on eating and drinking our meals elsewhere.'
4,'Kleine Zimmer aber schön','Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral an der Penn Station. Zum Times Square läuft man auch nicht lange. U Bahn Station ist direkt vor der Tür. \r\nDie Zimmer sind zwar klein aber sehr sauber und gemütlich. Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 37. Stock und ein super Blick auf Downtown. Zimmer wurde immer gut gereinigt. Ein und Auschecken ging schnell.'
5,'Great stay in the heat of the Summer!','Booked this as a cash and points reward stay (I am a Platinum Priority Club member) and paid an extra $40 per night for a guaranteed Times Square view. Personally I was not that fussed about the view of Times Square but it was a special family trip so I was happy to pay so other family members got a pleasant surprise!\r\nBefore booking I read Tripadvisor (obviously!) and think I should answer one of two of the points other people have raised.\r\nThe reception / lobby is not at street level, you need to go up the escalator. Some people have complained that this is bad for security as anyone could go up the escalators. Two things, they have bell hops on the ground level (there is a back street car entrance) and when was the last time you were stopped from entering a hotel lobby in any other hotel? Seems like a bit of a non issue to me!\r\nSome people have complained about long waits for things like extra pillows / towels etc. This hotel is a big hotel, a really big hotel. It may take a while to get things to your room! This is not an excuse for bad service, just a heads up that this is not a little 30 room Holiday Inn Express were every room is 10 seconds from the front desk!\r\nAs mentioned I got free Wi-Fi as I am a member of the Priority Club. I understand why people want free Wi-Fi (because I do!) but I also sympathise with hotels when you get loads of people trying to stream video and so the network grinds to a halt! In some respects I would rather pay a fee to ensure I got good access.\r\nMany people have mentioned the location - and you would be hard pressed to beat it if you want to be in the heart of Theatreland. Times Square is also the major subway intersection so you can get pretty much anywhere quickly.\r\nIs the hotel perfect? It is not, find me any hotel that is!\r\nWould I pay some of the peak rates ($400+ a night)? Probably not but you need to consider that Manhattan is one of the most expensive cities on earth for real estate!\r\nWould I come back? Absolutely!'
4,'Fantastic stay --- highly recommended.','I was hesitant to stay at this hotel because of the poor reviews, but my stay was far from bad. The Penn 5000 room I stayed in was clean and the breakfast was wonderful. The only thing I would recommend is a larger room for the breakfast -- the room is quite small and it gets crowded. For the money, this is an excellent hotel and is close to everything. I would stay here again!'
5,'amazing hotel!!!!!','Me and my twin sister stayed at the affinia for 3 nights for our 21st birthday and i absolutley loved it. As soon as we got there the staff was willing to take our suitcases for us, reception was very helpful and polite, checking in was quick and easy. we stayed on the 21st floor room 2107 and it was lovely. i was not expecting the rooms to be that big. We had a living area with sofas and a desk, a reasonable sized kitchin, and the bathroom with a bath. the bed room was nice and big with an ensuit bathroom with shower and toilet. The bed was so comfortable, even tho you do here the sound of cars honking there horns which i dont think you can get away from you can def get a good nights sleep. \r\nLocation; as i went mainly for the shopping it was perfect, a 1 min walk from macys and 5 min walk in to times square. Also very close to the empire state building. 5th avenue is only short way. we got a cab there costing about $8.\r\nOur flights were at 21.35 and we had to get out of our rooms at 12 so about 3 o\'clock we asked if we could use a room to shower and they more than happy to let us, which was in a much smaller room that just consisted of a bed and bathroom so we was very lucky to get our room. \r\nGetting to and from the hotel: on the way there me and my sister made a very silly mistake, we were so excited as we walked out of the airport looking for a taxi rank that a man asked if we wanted a taxi and we agreed and got in his which wasn\'t yellow :-( they charged us $75 which was far to much. and on the way back we got in a taxi arranged by the hotel which we shared with another couple, the taxi driver saud it would be $45 (make sure u ask for the flat rate to jfk) he dropped the 1st couple off at there terminal and they gave us $30 off there fare and when we got to our terminal we thought we would give $30 aswell with added tip, and the taxi driver said it wasnt enough and it was $45 each, we argued our point and he went away with $60 so make sure you are aware of how much it is before you go. \r\nif you are travelling with virgin they should give you a call at ur hotel and ask you to go to a new york welcome meeting, which is well worth it and you get $25 off at planet hollywood. \r\nFor sight seeing you should def go to the rockefeller centre, amazing views from the 70th floor, and its better than the empire state building as you fet all round views. \r\ni would def stay here again, and i plan to next year!!!!'
1,'Under Renovation-Don\'t Stay Here!','My family and I loved this hotel. We have stayed at this hotel once a year for the past three years. We always stay in three different rooms. We stayed Labor Day weekend 2011. It was worst experience and we won\'t come back. They ruined this hotel. All four of us had the same experiences in three separate rooms. The lighting in the rooms are atrocious!! They are difficult to manage and difficult to use. In one room there was no separation between the shower and the bathroom floor and the bathroom floor was always flooded after a shower. The maids leave enough towels, shampoo and conditioner and soap for one day. I woke up one morning took my shower and left for the day. When I returned that evening they picked the dirty towels cleaned the room but didn\'t leave me clean towels or soap or shampoo or conditioner. All three rooms! Management told us that we would have to call housekeeping every day if we clean towels and toiletries replace. For a room fee of $500.00 per night that is absolutely unacceptable! One of the rooms also was not cleaned properly. We had breakfast one morning and they staff was not attentive. They had a beautiful bar and they closed it. The hotel lobby is not user friendly. In my opinion this is no longer a grand NYC hotel. This hotel is now an Art Deco hotel that belongs on strip in Miami Beach. We are so disappointed in this hotel. There is no need to stay until renovations are completed. However we wont stay here again.'
3,'NYC rooms are tiny, but these are especially so. Good location.','The bar in this hotel is what keeps it going and presumably attracts customers, but it is expensive. Apparently it\'s quite exclusive unless you\'re a guest at the hotel. We did enjoy some cocktails there and it really does have a great atmosphere.\r\nThe rooms are small and include a small low double bed, a cupboard to hang a few clothes, small bedside tables, a desk and a TV with stand are all squeezed into the tiny wooden floored room. The artwork was nice.\r\nThe bathroom in our room was a small L shape with just a shower. The curtain to which couldn\'t be closed over the glass wall that separated it from the bedroom, this was fine for us as we\'re a couple but it would be more than a little awkward for friends sharing. With it being a small L shape you had to squeeze round the sink (I\'m not large!).\r\nThe bed was small and fairly hard, over the 3 nights we were there I didn\'t get one good night\'s sleep. This was also due to the noise level, we were on the 10th floor overlooking the courtyard. The hotel building has a section open to the street (forms a sort of horseshoe) and the street noise carried up to our room, sirens and rubbish trucks (dustcarts) can be heard throughout the night.\r\nWhen we arrived we had to queue about 15mins to check in in the afternoon, not terrbile.\r\nOverall this hotel was very clean, had a good location for the park and subway and a nice bar. The rooms were smaller than any other I\'ve had in my 3 trips to New York and the bed was uncomfortable. Service was neither good nor bad as we really only saw the staff to check in.'
5,'Outstanding hotel','What a wonderful hotel! Everything was clean!! We loved having the extra space with the one room suite.We traveled with our three sons 2 who are in college and one in middle school. Having the living room area gave them a little privacy at night when they wanted to stay up and watch TV. The queen sized beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. We had 2 full bathrooms which made getting out in the morning a breeze. The kitchenette was also nice to have, especially in the morning when I could make a pot of coffee and the boys could have milk, cereal, juice and doughnuts. There is a nice market practically next door to the front entrance of the hotel where we purchased our food. The convenience of this hotel, with Penn Station Subway right across the street, is unbeatable. We stayed on the 18th floor which kept the noise level from the street down. The staff was always friendly and helpful, never were they rude or put out acting. The housekeeping staff was unusually friendly, one morning we had a late start and the housekeeper very graciously said she\'d come back at our convenience. I also ended up leaving my make up kit behind on the day we left. I discovered that I\'d left it the next morning. I called the Affinia and spoke to Janet in housekeeping. She returned my call that evening saying they\'d found my make up bag and could ship it to me the following Mon. She couldn\'t have been nicer. If we ever get the opportunity to visit NYC again I want to reserve this same hotel.'
4,'Spacious rooms and prime location','We really enjoyed our stay at the Affinia this August, the rooms were clean and as a family of five we found the rooms very spacious. Before our trip we emailed Affinia to ask for a room on one of the top floors, we would definitley recommend this as our room was quiet which enabled us to get a good nights sleep! The location was superb, it was less than a ten minute walk to the empire state building and only a short walk to times sqaure. The concierge staff were very helpful and recommended some great restaurants nearby. We shall definitely be staying here again!'
4,'Gedateerd en smoezelig om te zien, maar schoon, netjes en superlocatie!','Op basis van de gelezen reviews op internet, waren we wat huiverig geworden, maar dat bleek geheel onnodig. Het hotel ligt op een superlocatie, maar oogt wat gedateerd en smoezelig. De lobby is prachtig, de gangen zijn donker en wat luguber, de muren en kamerdeuren zijn afgebladderd, de kamers zijn gedateerd. Pluspunten: de kamer werd elke dag grondig gepoetst, heerlijke bedden, de badkamer was brandschoon, bed werd elke dag verschoond, elke dag 2 schone handdoeken per persoon. Wij waren erg tevreden en hebben een topverblijf gehad.'
3,'Schlechtes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis','Leider entsprach dieses Hotel nicht unseren Erwartungen. Die Lage ist selbstverständlich klsse, aber die Zimmer waren schon etwas verwohnt, klein und mit einer schlechten Aircon ausgestattet, die eines 5 Sterne Hotels in dieser Preisklasse nicht würdig ist. Wir würden dieses Hotel definitiv nicht empfehlen.'
4,'Professional staff and great location','We stayed at this hotel for a week, and we really liked it! The rooms are small, but nice and clean. The concierge helped us with tickets, the transport desk arranged for transportation to JFK, we borrowed an adapter from the front desk, and when our airconditioning started making a funny noise at 11pm we had a janitor come fix it in 10 minutes. Overall the staff and the location makes this hotel very good. Oh, and free and easy accessible Wifi!'

4,'We thought Hudson was great!','My boyfriend and I stayed here with some friends for a weekend of partying and shopping. For our purposes, it was great! If you are a business traveler needing ample workspace or a family with children, I would not stay here. This hotel is for the young and hip looking to have a good time. Yes, the rooms are small....but aren\'t we in NYC? I have stayed in smaller places. I guess everyone is different, but I don\'t mind a small room as long as it is clean and well organized. Our room was VERY clean and the bed was so comfy. We were only there to sleep and take showers. One other warning....If you are staying there with someone you might not feel super-comfortable with, you might want to choose another hotel. There is only a glass wall in between the bathroom and bedroom with a sheer cloth over the glass. For friends, or very close relationships, it is fine. If you have been dating 1 month....maybe not! Also, there is a great sandwich shop....if you take a left out of the hotel and walk to the corner and make a left you will see a sandwich shop with a yellow sign just a couple of doors down on your left. They make the yummiest, freshest sandwiches and soups....it is a hole-in-the wall, but great. We ate there twice. Also, there is a CVS Pharmacy on the corner by the hotel, very nice if you need something. Overall, I would definitely stay at the Hudson again!'
3,'A little disappointing','Stayed at the Hilton New York for 2 nights on our return from Orlando, location is good and the rooms were reasonable but now dated and most probable in need of refurbishment.\r\nThe main issue I have with the hotel is the staff\'s attitude, it is unfriendly, unwelcoming and at times down right rude.'
5,'Uno dei palazzi dei film!','Bello! Pulito! Posizione fantastica proprio di fronte al Madison Square Garden e con fermata della metro proprio sotto l\'hotel. Stanza piccola ma pulita così come il bagno. Promosso a pieni voti.'
2,'Not A Good Value','Checked in on September 5 having booked and prepaid ($353/night per room) two deluxe rooms for a business trip. Upon arrival was told that the system was down and that we would be given a two bedroom suite instead. Turned out the two bedroom suite was two very small bedrooms with full size beds and even smaller bathrooms.  Went back to front desk to change rooms and got two new rooms on the 5th floor. Upon entering one of the rooms, the shower and bathroom had not been cleaned, had hair in the drain and smelled of mildew. Went back to desk to change rooms yet again, then had rooms 531 and 2320. Came to find out that one bathroom (531) was just a shower and not a full bath while the other (2320) had a full bathroom. When we asked the front desk about this we were told that the hotel does not have cookie cutter rooms and that while each room is considered a deluxe room that they can be different. I can not find this fact explained anywhere on the hotel\'s website or on Orbitz and this makes very little sense particularly considering the rooms were pre-paid and booked at the same time and should have been held as two identical rooms.  It seemed that the staff did their best to understand the problem but really did not wish to rectify it or give any financial remediation. Felt exceptionally cheated and that we very much over paid for what we got. I have stayed at The Affinia Shelbourne and had a much better experience and thought that the rooms there were better priced and better maintained.  I would not recommend this hotel unless it was priced dramatically lower.'
3,'Average hotel, excellent location','One night stay during our three nights in NYC. \r\nIf you\'re looking for a hotel that\'s incredibly central, right next to central park, but don\'t mind fairly drab and tired rooms, then this is the one for you. \r\n4pm check-in is unimpressive and charging to store bags is equally unimpressive as most guests have no option. Charging 3x more to store bags on check-out is again, unimpressive. \r\nLocation is superb and we enjoyed walking out of the lobby and being minutes walk from several top attractions and cafés. \r\nOnce you\'ve walked through the impressive, NY-style lobby and got in the lift, it\'s a bit (ironically) downhill from there. The room was in real need of a refurb and smelled slightly damp when we walked in. Wallpaper pealing, carpet coming up in several place and lots of noise from 7th Avenue when the windows were open. Beds were reasonably comfortable.\r\nExactly as described by a previous reviewer, this hotel suffers from the sheer number of guests that it can accommodate. I also waited 10 minutes for a lift down from the 15th floor to the lobby, before eventually being directed to a shabby service lift by cleaning staff. \r\nIn summary - excellent location but poor quality rooms.'
1,Cockroaches,'STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!! We arrived at this hotel and the Individual who booked us in was extremely helpful and so we where excited to go and settle in to get ready to go back out again......the room however was extremely dated and would not even cover a 2 star hotel in the UK. There where marks all over the walls, hair in the bathroom and to top it off several hairs in the bed throw which made me feel instantly sick. The hotel was fully booked and they had no spare rooms so it was a put up and shut up incident! We decided to spend little time in the hotel as possible and just touch base. I did 3 days later out of the 5 day trip drop my make up bag on the floor and went down to retrieve the make up off the floor find a dead cockroach. We managed to somehow how get it into a bin and I went down to reception with the cockroach bin and asked to speak to the manager. He apologised and I refused to go back into the room. He managed to find us a Room and gave us two complementary breakfast\'s (I will get onto that after) We then packed our bags to move and the new room seemed okay............HOWEVER, during the night my mother and I woke up in the middle of the night actually scared because we thought someone was in our room due to the loud bang. This turned out to be a broken central heating system and would do loud banging noises throughout the night? We wanted to bring this to the attention of the staff to look at and the member of staff was extremely rude so I spoke to the manager and they said they would have a look.\r\nWe then went for a complementary breakfast (even though the individual who checked us in advised said not to go due to it not being great. He recommended Juniors which is just around the corner and was indeed fabulous for breakfast) the breakfast was not good and we did not even use the extra free voucher the following day due to the terrible food.)\r\nThen to top it off when we got back the room it had not been cleaned, with no bed\'s made or any clean towels. I rang up house keeping to sort this out and it took 40 minutes to come and sort this (the lady was very nice who came to rectify the problem) \r\nThey had also not fixed the heating and we where woken up several times in the night again.\r\nIt was such a shame about the hotel and I have not written a review previously but my mum and I where so upset I had to let anyone know who was doing research for the best hotel for money.\r\nI will also be letting the holiday company know our concerns about the hotel they are sending guests to.\r\nOn another note we both loved NYC and where worried about not feeling safe but this was not even an issue. Enjoy your holiday but go somewhere else........'
5,'Great room, great view, great value, great location, great customer service!','Within a block of Carnegie Deli, geat bagel place called Fluffy\'s acroos from the deli, great location, and a big beautiful room. The day we left there was a big blow-up bedbug alert outside of the hotel, but our room, bed, and stay was perfect. Teh staff was great, even though we were late checking out, due to a slow cab ride back to the hotel after sight-seeing. The manager was very helpful and there was no extra cost for our tardiness. I will stay at this hotel again. If you are concerend about bugs, check first but I saw none. Barbara K'
2,'Gute Lage!','Ausser der Lage hat das Hotel nicht viel zu bieten. Die Rezeption ist desorientiert und unfreundlich. Sauberkeit der Zimmer lässt zu wünschen übrig. In unserem Zimmer waren Haare im Bett und im Badezimmer!!!!!!!! Und das nicht nur einmal!\r\nDas Web check in vor dem Flug sollte gratis sein, aber leider nicht die Austrian Airlines, also hat man mir 40 Dollar (!!) (auch das ausdrucken einer Bestätigung) verrechnet.\r\nEine gute Lage, aber leider das war´s! \r\nIch würde jemanden, der vor allem Sauberkeit im Hotelzimmer schätzt nicht empfehlen.'
4,'Small room but clean and affordable','The rooms are small but clean and with free low speed internet (premium costs $9 per day) and an excellent diner attached for 24 hour dining. Great menu if on low fat or organic diet.\r\nFor the expedia price of about $200, good value and right across from Madison Square Gardens.\r\nVery good gym but no free weights.'
3,'Lounge on concierge floor is not worth it anymore....','Stayed in this hotel with our 2 teenagers from April first to April 6.2010\r\nHad 2 double rooms concierge level. Confirmation number 61956429\r\nMy girlfriend has been in this hotel several times in the past and was thrilled. I expected as much this time but alot has changed.\r\nNo more fridge in the room unless you rent it with in 30$ charge.\r\nNo morning paper. (expected in a 4 * hotel). \r\nNo robe & slippers ( unless you ask for it)\r\nThe bathtub and the toilets were not properly cleaned. \r\nAnd the MOST DISSAPOINTING in this hotel was the LOUNGE on concierge floor.\r\nBearly nothing to eat except crackers & cheese or a few toast & cookies. No more hot snacks as in the past. (See attached picture) At breakfest time people were staying in line waiting for a place to sit! \r\nWe talked to the manager who told us that a new Director took over a few months ago and for that reason alot of things have changed!\r\nHe also believes that more then a 100$ extra a day to be on concierge level\r\nis still worth it due to the fact that the hotel is located in Times Square.\r\nHe finally gave us a 50$ refund per night. \r\nIt\'s worth speaking out when not as good as expected!'
4,'Perfect for a quick \'tourist\' break','My fiance and I stayed at the Hudson in December \'06 when we went to NY to do Christmas shopping. We checked in late on the Friday night - staff on duty were very nice. I didnt find noise to be excessive at all, despite a very loud bar downstairs. Although I did read the reviews on trip advisor, I was still a little shocked at how tiny the rooms were! It was kind of funny actually, you have to hand it to the designers, they really maximise the available space and it is decorated in a very clever way. My fiance is 6\'2\'\' and he managed to squeeze into the bathroom without too much trouble! There was a bit of a space problem when we brought back our shopping, but a bit of tidying up and re-organizing the suitcases took care of it.\r\nOn the down side, the bed was not too comfy and the heaters were a bit noisy - but it was no big deal. The hotel was so stylishly decorated, I was in awe. Its quite nightclub-like, a really different experience. \r\nThe staff were very nice, contrary to other reviewers experiences. I\'d say that if you are in town for a short break and you don\'t plan on spending much time in your room, yet you want a cool hotel, then the Hudson is an option for you. We did not eat at the hotel at all or drink at the bar, we went out. Coming from London for the weekend we wanted to maximise the NY experience and see different parts of the city.\r\nIt is a short 10-15 minute walk to 5th Avenue shops and 2 minutes to Columbus Circle\'s small indoor shopping mall. Cabs are plentiful outtside the hotel. \r\nIts definitely not for a \'spoil yourself\' weekend away treat , nor for those who like space and quiet, or for business travellers. Also not for children. Its a young, hip hotel, and as functional as a Starck design is intended to be! Very fun experience!'
5,'1st time but not the last','First trip to the BIG Apple - but will not be the last! Location great but beware the hotel is huge and busy so service at reception and breakfast can be a little frustrating! That said, the food is the New York Market was great, the public spaces are lovely and the staff (on the whole) are polite and friendly. Rooms a little small but are clean and tastefully furnished with ice machines on each floor - you will need ice and fluid as the hotel is really warm. Directly opposite Radio City and Moma and a short stroll to 5th Avenue, Times Sq and Central Park.'
4,'Big and beautiful','The hotel lobby is grand and the room was nicely decorated too. For two adults, it would have been nice to have more than just one chair. The L was half a block away but it was quiet with no more than a low rumble heard at night. Convenient location.'
4,Great!,'I have just returned from 5 nights in New York Grand Hyatt. It was amazing! The hotel is huge and the rooms are nice. There was 3 of us sharing a room, there were 2 double beds and plenty of room for us to get ready. The bathroom was also spacious with big mirror to do your make-up in. The lobby is grand and is constantly busy. We had continental breakfast included however we upgraded for 3 dollars and were allowed fruit, cheese and ham. the bagels are amazing and the wee waiter will toast them for u. The hotel is attached onto grand central station which is handy if you want to go travelling around. \r\nIt is centrally located therefore u can walk to all the major shops like macys where we spent the whole day shopping like mad!!\r\nIts graeat and i would recommed a stay here.'
5,'Ideally located, with great facilities, this is your choice!','I have spent two weeks in New York for a conference and stayed in this hotel. The place is awesome! Extremely well located, only walking distance from major touristic attractions in NY, with excellent service and great rooms. If your budget is around this amount, do not miss the opportunity of staying in Grand Hyatt NY! You will not regret it. You will remember it for years!'
3,'I\'ve had better stays here...','I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan one night in March 2009, as I do annually. Great location, very nice staff. 4th floor room; small view of top of the Empire State Building other than that not a great view.\r\nI have had better experiences at the Affinia. \r\nCons: \r\n-In-room Internet access did not work, despite repeated phone discussions with technical service. \r\n-Cable TV reception terrible.\r\n-Smallest hotel shower ever.\r\n-Billing and check in issues; central reservation systems had not placed our reservations into the onsite system. Hotel overcharged our group for additional nights; we had to resend confirmations we received from the hotel prior to checkin.\r\nPros:\r\n+Location: Madison Square Garden and Penn Station\r\n+Overall room size for NYC\r\nHotel rooms (and I believe public areas) are undergoing a major renovation beginning in May, which is good. The place could use some sprucing up.'
1,'Fire on the 11th Floor','We stayed at this hotel from 11-14th July. On the 13th of July there was a fire on the 11th floor around 1.30pm. We were woken by hotel staff to evacuate the floor which was quite frightening. The smoke was so thick you could hardly see. There was no fire alarm, no evacuation signal and no sprinklers on the 11th floor. When I questioned the firemen in attendance about this, they told me to take it up with management.\r\nThe location may be very good but my advice is, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.'
3,'Great location average hotel','I have to say that I was disappointed in the hotel in terms of service. Our room was nice, no view but a corner room big enough for a cot for my teenage son. I can\'t speak for all the rooms, but our was decorated in the atrium style and was quite okay. I didn\'t find the hotel staff overly friendly but perhaps that is because of the hotel\'s size that the service is very impersonal. I stayed at a Starwood luxury property in Washington right after and there was a huge difference in the level of service. If you\'re looking for a business hotel in Times Square, it fits the bill. Next time I\'d be more inclined to stay farther away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square.'
4,'ótima opção','Localização excelente , em plena Times Square, fácil acesso a metro, pontos turisticos, Broadway, quartos muito bons muitos são recentemente reformados de tamanho novaiorquino  mas não são apertados, serviço e atendimento eficientes, restaurante bom , segurança atenta .'
5,'Great hotel, great location, great staff','My company had a meeting and accommodated us all at the Affinia Manhattan. I was pleasantly surprised at the newly renovated and spacious rooms! From check in to check out the service was very friendly and genuine. The function space as well as food and beverage they provided during our meetings were also excellent! You couldn\'t ask for a better location across from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. I definitely plan to return soon...and I\'m bringing my kids next time!'
4,Manager,'We arrived at this hotel very tired because the trip and Drita was very helpfull to give us a early check in. That was difficult because the hotel was completely booked. She is really good and the hotel is very good located.'
3,'Mixed feelings','We booked the Hudson for our honeymoon to NYC. After booking I read reviews on Tripadvisor and started to worry....\r\nOn arrival the front desk staff where fairly helpful, we had a pre-arrangement regarding the deposit that was made between the manager and our travel agent and the receptionist refused to believe me even when I showed her e-mail confirmation and I had to ask her to check with the manager. When she did this everything was fine. \r\nAs a honeymoon couple we got our room upgraded - so everything I\'d read about the rooms being very small wasnt really relevant to us. Our room was still on the small side, but was more than adequate for our needs. The only issue was the lack of lighting - even the light in the bathroom wasnt very good, so putting on your make-up was quite a struggle! \r\nOn our first night we were hit with some strange banging noises coming from the wall (which looked out over the roof of the reception area), it sounded like pipes banging, so we assumed it was from the room above us shower or sink. it stopped after the second night, so we didnt mention it to the staff. \r\nThe best thing about the hotel is its location. Right near central park and columbus circle which is perfect for catching the subway to whereever you need to go really. And round the other corner leads you to Hell\'s Kitchen and lots of resturants if you didnt want to venture too far to eat. \r\nOne afternoon we had a coffee in the library - $15 for two coffees seemed rather extremem to me, as did the $20 something my husband paid for 2 bottles of lager. The resturant wasnt open at the time of our stay, which was a shame as it would have been nice to be able to come down for breakfast a couple of mornings. \r\nAll in all, our stay wasnt spoiled by the hotel, but at the same time we wouldnt say that the hotel added to our experience either. \r\nWe cant wait to go back to NYC, but would definately not be staying here again.'
3,'No esta mal','Nosotros estuvimos en septiembre y estuvimos viendo las criticas del hotel y llegamos con un poco de miedo. Yo no estoy acostumbrada a hoteles de lujo, pero para dormir esta bien. Es bastante antiguo pero nosotros nos encontramos todo bastante limpio, con servicio de habitaciones todos los días, agua caliente, bañera, cama de matrimonio..... lo justo para ir a dormir.\r\nEl check-in lo hicimos en menos de cinco minutos, no había nadie. A lo largo de los días y dependiendo de la hora si que veíamos algo de cola, pero nada exagerado. \r\nLa ubicacion genial.\r\nSi quieres un sitio barato y centrico para dormir lo recomiendo.'
5,'Spacious room with view of the Hudson','We stayed here for 1 night/2 day trip to New York after 12 days in Florida. The hustle and bustle of Times Sq made Orlando look like the relaxing part of our vacation! The Hotel however is great. I had booked a Hudson river 2 queen room for the 4 of us. I had informed the hotel of my wife\'s 40th birthday and not only did they send us some wonderful NY cheesecake to the room but they gave us a corner room on the 41st floor with an amazing view of the Hudson and the surrounding skyscrapers. This made the stay really special - thanks to the hotel. The hotel is a smart, calm oasis in the middle of Times Sq.'
4,'Center of it all','The Marriott Marquis is an attraction within itself in the middle of Times Square in Manhattan. My first visit to the hotel, it was quite overwhelming with almost 2000 rooms and the elevators that you enter after you chose your floor. The amount of meeting space at the Marquis is absolutely huge, considering that it\'s in Manhattan. There\'s ALWAYS something going on: morning, daytime, evening. I\'ve stayed at a lot of hotels in the past, and the lobby being on the 8th floor is a small hassle, since the elevators take forever to arrive to the lobby, and the escalators even longer. The staff is very friendly, and there are employees everywhere that are willing to help.\r\nMy friends and I visit NYC frequently and love trying new hotels in the area, on all different scales. For this big box hotel, we were quite satisfied by the rate we paid, the service we received, and the location at the center of it all. Next time we stay in Times Square, we\'ll have to make it out to a Broadway show! I would definitely stay here again... try the Japanese sushi bar on the lobby floor!'
3,'Better than I was expecting','Right then, after booking this hotel in August for November this gave me plenty of time to read the reviews and to be honest I was dreading it.\r\nTo my delight it couldn\'t of been more opposite,check in was fast and efficient,we were booked into room 987 (remember this) and the room was clean and tidy.\r\nMassive bed!!!\r\nAlso had a view of the empire state.\r\nThe window outside was a little dirty but I could live with that.\r\nBed sheets and towels were changed everyday.\r\nThe bathroom had the odd chipped enamel in the bath and the odd flake of paint on the ceiling but again I could live with that.\r\nThere was no mould or bed bugs anywhere.\r\nSo if you are reading this wondering what to do all I can say is that if you have room 987 then I can\'t see why you would be disappointed.'
1,'Terrible service, hidden charges','We arrived at this hotel a group of friends having been advised that a 2 double bed room would be fine. The beds were actually only 3 quarter beds and so after much discussion they did bring us a camp bed for the room - not what you expect to be sleeping on when you are paying that much. With the exception of Matthew on the front desk and one of the duty managers Krysten everyone else we dealt with didn\'t seem that bothered and treated us like we were a hassle. It was my friends 30th and they were advertising in room massages but when we called we were told they were not available in the rooms. We wanted to use the gym but that was $15 a head per visit and when we came to leave our luggage they charged $3.50 per item. Twice they did not make all the beds up in our room and when we queried it the reason was that we had left personal belongings on the bed and it was their policy not to touch personal belongings (which were PJ\'s and a book!) There was nowhere to just sit in the lobby comfortably unless you bought a drink at the bar. In summary we chose the Hilton because generally have found them good in the UK but I would never stay here again.'
3,'Just OK','I stayed at the Park Central for two weeks on a business trip. It is an OK place but for what it is I felt it was a bit pricey. The staff are friendly(ish) especially the cleaning staff. I stayed in a concierge room and expected a bit more by way of facilities and size. Also on entry the room smelt and after some time I worked out that it was the shower curtain. I asked for it to be changed and that made a world of difference. Another thing is that wifi costs $15 dollars a day!!\r\nOne good thing about the hotel is the location. It is near enough to time square and very close to Central Park. Also I found the bed very comfortable.'
2,'Buena ubicación pero muy viejo','Habitaciones viejas. En la bodega de las maletas hay ratones'
3,'Gran ubicaci\'on y buen servicio','Al parecer, los hoteles de categor\'ia media de Nueva York no tienen nada que ver con los espa;oles. La habitaci\'on es peque;a, apenas caben la cama, dos mesillas, una c\'omoda con la televisi\'on y una silla, pero es muy pr\'actico. En el armario hay una tabla de planchar con plancha, por lo que puedes adecentar un poco la ropa que viene arrugada en la maleta sin necesidad de contratar el servicio fuera. El ba;o es peque;o (ba;era, sanitario y lavabo), pero es muy funcional, y la limpieza y la renovaci\'on de toallas se realiza a diario. No tiene minibar ni ninguna atraccion a mayores. En nuestra habitaci\'on, situada en el piso 33, la vista era bastante buena, teniendo en cuenta que la ventana apenas se abre 15 cent\'imetros. Ve\'iamos la ciudad e incluso el puerto. Pero la ubicaci\'on es excelente. El hotel est\'a a escasos metros del Madison Square Garden, el Empire State, los centros comerciales Macy\'s y a escasos metros de las entradas de la estaci\'on de metro de Pennsylvania (Pensylvannia Station), desde la que hay enlaces a toda la ciudad. Tambi\'en est\'a muy cerca de Times Square y de la Quinta Avenida. No en vano, el New Yorker est\'a situado en la Octava Avenida, Calle 34. \r\nNosotros no ten\'iamos el desayuno incluido, pero todas las ma;anas, justo al lado del restaurante hab\'ia un peque;o mostrador en el que pod\'ias comprar un caf\'e, un zumo, un yogur y alguna pieza de boller\'ia, a un precio no barato pero s\'i razonable. La atenci\'on del personal es bastante buena.'
5,'À conseiller','Un hôtel tout à fait recommandable . Les chambres sont certes de taille modestes, mais confortables et fonctionnelles. La salle de bain est elle aussi acceptable. Le hall art déco est aussi à voir. Le service est variable mais globalement positif.\r\nPar contre l atout indéniable est sa situation, à 10 mn de Time Square et à proximité des lignes bleues, rouges et oranges. Un départ pour Boston se fait au pied de l hôtel .\r\nEn ce qui concerne la restauration , aucun soucis dans ce quartier. On y trouve une multitude de restaurants, de fast food ou autres.\r\nAyant fait plusieurs hôtels à NY, je recommande celui ci'
4,'Fantastic Location but a bit pricey','The first thing I have to say is that the location of this hotel is unbeatable! It simply couldnt be closer to times square whilst still allowing you to sleep. Central park is 10 mins walk, rockerfella 5 mins walk broadway all around you, etc, etc. The hotel is also VERY busy with relentless streams of people when we were there.\r\nOur room unfortunately didnt have a view of times square but still had a view to the hudson river all the same. Our room was reasonably tight in size but very modern throughout. \r\nOne reason we selected this hotel was because it had a gym and pool. The gym is great although undergoing some improvements. The pool however is currently closed for refurbishment which was very frustrating. The other irritations were that it costs $10 per person to use EXCEPT if you join the crowne plaza club for free!\r\nI would recommend this hotel mainly on its great location. I also highly recommend Billy Elliott and catching any sporting event you can at Madison square garden- awesome!!'
5,'Beautiful hotel, wonderful location, kind personnel, the place to be in NYC!','I am a Starwood customer and was treated very well from the time I made the reservation through Starwood until Checkout.. The service was prompt and friendly. Anyone I asked for information and was not sure of an answer found one. The location was superior and convenient for everything that we did. I had a corner deluxe room which was great. It was clean and loved all the windows. It made our trip and experience to remember.'
4,'Perfect Location, Great Staff, Good Room, Right Price','My wife and I stayed at the hotel for most of Thanksgiving Week 2012. The location is perfect for walking all over mid-Manhattan. The staff treated us very well from phone calls before our visit from Atlanta to the moment we departed. Cynthia and Elizabeth took care of us by phone, David beautifully checked us in, and when the room was cold the first night, and the TV remote needed a battery, David corrected the problems. Ellen was the star of the show for us from the desk staff. Unasked, she gave us 2 complimentary breakfasts in the City House dining room for our inconvenience with the temperature and the remote. Nice touch. We met the delightful Winson B. there, our server, who made dining a fun experience. Fine job, staff!\r\nThe room was pleasant, the sheets and bedding very clean and comfortable, and the price for a Manhattan hotel was right. Central Park two blocks north, and Times Square 10 minutes south. \r\nThe hotel is an older building, and there was some stale smell in our hallway. Perhaps some new carpet would do the job.I hope some of the current renovation takes care of this problem, just as former renovation provided the very nice workout room. The lamps in the room needed some dusting. Other than those things it was a very good stay.'
5,'Excellent honeymoon.','Stayed here in May 2011 for our honeymoon for 6 nights.\r\nHotel was great and all members of staff made us feel welcome in helping out with any query! It was our 1st visit to New York and as a holiday in NY is mostly sightseeing I would highly recommend this hotel on location alone.It is situated on 34th street on the corner of 8th avenue. Location wise to those that dont know NY like we didnt it is a fab base to have to explore this great city! The plus points are that the empire state building is on 34th street which is a great sight to see from your hotel and is only 5 mins walk away! Also on 34th is Macy\'s which is great for shopping,not only this but across the road is a 12 screen AMC cinema which is gr8 for a nights entertainment.Food wise the hotel has a Tick tick diner attached to it which was great and huge portions and also all within 1-2 minutes walk you have McDonalds, Wendys, Dunkin donuts, Burger king,Familga Pizza (top!!!) and TGI Fridays. As for general access you also cant go wrong, Penn station and subway station is across the road and you can get any subway line and trains to other city\'s (Boston, Washington etc) We were there 6 nights and only caught the subway twice as if you dont mind walking you really can walk around to most sights, we walked to times sq (10 mins walk) and Central Park 25 mins walk, ok walking wont be for everyone but we found we took more of the city atmosphere walking through the city (and burned of the calories as we really did eat a lot!!)\r\nOk as for the rest of the hotel heres the pointers I would want to know before booking:-\r\nRooms- clean with flatscreen TV (27 channels) daily maid service.Room was quite small but this is normal with NY hotels unless you pay the extra but more than adequate.Another bonus is the hotel has free wifi which as we took the laptop was great for getting the next day planned and checking on google maps how to get there.\r\nService- All staff members polite (even the mean looking security guys) which being a city hotel you are glad they are there even though I must say I always felt safe in NY. The concierge was a great source of info although dont be lazy and book tickets through them as it pays to shop around! They quoted $169 each for Mama Mia Broadway tickets and we got them from TKTS on Broadway for $89 each and that was for tickets 8 rows from the front (TKTS is a must if you want to catch a Broadway show but you can only buy tickets a few hours before the show thats how they are discounted, normally 50\%off!!!)\r\nSo all in all highly recommended if your looking for somewhere not too expensive, clean with great facilities and a fab location to sightsee this is the hotel for you!'
3,'Over-rated and over-priced','I had stayed at this hotel previously a few times. The atmosphere is wonderful and historic in the common areas. My room, on the 8th floor, overlooked a fire escape. Only has wired internet at the cost of $20/day...really? The gym is really nice, an extra $10/day. The room itself was comfortable, but the EL going by early in the AM, made it difficult to sleep later. Staff did not seem very interested in service...from the bar to the front desk. Having stayed in 5 different hotels in the past month, this one was the most expensive and the least value for the money.'
1,'A eviter ! Hotel vieillissant et bruyant !','Je reviens d un séjour d une semaine au Hyatt de New York. Quelle déception ! Cet hotel est devenu vieillissant. Le lobby est triste et bruyant ...un vrai hall de gare. En ce qui concerne les chambres ..a plus de 300 dollars la nuit - c est tout simplement une honte.\r\nLors de notre arrivée, les draps étaient sales, des cheveux plein la salle de bains, les lampes abimées...en un mot un hotel vieillissant. Ceci nous fut vite confirmé puisque le surlendemain de notre arrivée nous avons été réveillé à 7 h du matin par des coups de marteaux dans les murs qui ont durés toute la semaine. En effet, nous avons appris que Hyatt était entrain de rénové les deux étages en dessous de nous. Sympathique me direz vous pour un hotel de ce standing.. Quand au bruit pas de commentaires, entre les portes qui ne cessent de claquer dans les couloirs et le mot dans l ascenseur qui demande aux résidents de l\'hotel de ne pas hurler dans les couloirs apres 21h...vous comprenez vite ou vous etes tombé ! En un mot A EVITER ABSOLUMENT !!'
2,'Less than impressed','My wife and I stayed at this hotel over the weekend, as we were attending a wedding that was taking place in the hotel.\r\nOur experience started off very poorly - we arrived at 3pm, the stated check in time, and were told that our room was not ready (and if this was a 15 minute wait I\'d not complain, but we had to wait over an hour). It was not just us, most of the guests in the lobby were being told the same thing, with the excuse being that the hotel was full last night. Ummmm, aren\'t hotels supposed to be able to plan for that eventuality and staff accordingly? I\'ve checked into sold out hotels many times and never had to wait for my room for this reason. And the front desk staff were very rude about this, and in general - during our visit my room key stopped working and I went down to the front desk to have the issue corrected, and was told by the clerk that I was mistaken as to which room I was staying in and that\'s why the card wasn\'t working (turned out I was right and she was just an idiot).\r\nThe hotel works hard at being hip and modern, and I think they cater to that crowd. I noticed a lot of the other guests were european tourists (with the accompanying hygiene and personal space issues). There isn\'t even a sign out front letting you know where it is, kind of an if you don\'t know we are here, we don\'t want you here kind of thing, very funny and very New York hipster. \r\nNow, onto the room - we paid $250 per night for the privilege of staying in a closet big enough to hold a bed and a bathroom. Now, I get that this is NYC so prices will be up there. Also, if they are catering to the tourist crowd, it makes sense to have small rooms since they will mostly be using the rooms just to sleep and get cleaned up (or not, see the european tourist part). So, if you are looking for a place in the city that provides a room you can relax in, don\'t stay here. If you like effective air conditioning in your room, don\'t stay here. If you are looking to avoid be condescended to by the front desk staff for daring to ask that your room be ready at check in time, or your key stops working, and would like to avoid treated like you should be grateful for being granted the privilege of spending your money in the hotel, don\'t stay here.\r\nIn fact, just don\'t stay here at all.'
4,'Enjoyed Affinia Manhattan!','Stayed 1 night with family. We received a complimentary upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite on the top 28th floor (celebrated a birthday). Yes, you do hear sirens at night but we knew about it beforehand and had brought earplugs. A very spacious, modern suite, great central location and welcoming, attentive and friendly staff made this a very enjoyable stay.\r\nThank you, Affinia!'
4,'Location excellent','We stayed here for a week. We found the staff very helpful the room cleaned daily. The location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and Broadwayb shows.\r\nBreakfast was noy included in our deal and we thought it was alittle expensive but a great selection of food. the bar was lovely for a nightcap.\r\nWe will certainly use this hotel when we visit New York again.'
4,'Location + Fair Price = Good experience','Upon arrival I found the lobby clean and expansive. The check in is tucked away to the right of the main entrance making it difficult to find when standing in awe of simply being in New York (my first visit). I was directed by the concierge desk that I mistakenly approached on where to check in. The process was quick and efficient as with many transactions in the city. I received my keys and headed to the elevators. Be prepared to show your room key each time to head toward the elevators as an attendant is on duty to prevent random tourists from catching a ride up. I was on the 37th floor out of 42. The view was toward downtown and I could see the manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, the new tower, as well as lady liberty on a clear day. The room is very small as are many habitats in New York, yet is comfortable. It had a queen size, comfortable bed. Also a decent closet and dresser to unpack and settle in. I usually live out of my suitcase when I travel but found it necessary to unpack due to lack of space. The bathroom is functional with a pedestal sink, large deep tub, and less than desirable shower head. I traveled alone and felt the room was more than adequate for my needs. It\'s about a 10 min walk to Times Square or Chelsea neighborhood. Directly across the street is Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden. To share the room I would have felt cramped but for the solo traveler it was great!'
2,'Affectionately Named \'Faulty Towers\'','Great location, reasonable hotel.....just a shame about the total lack of service, organisation or help.\r\nStayed here on business and although the interior and rooms are nice (small rooms, but perfectly formed), the hotel service was terrible. When we booked the trip, we struggled to get hold of anyone to organise our stay and events and we should have cancelled at this point - but we had decided to persevere due to the location.\r\nOn arrival we asked for help with business needs/events and received conflicting advice or indeed, total lack of organisation in some respects. They didn\'t even warn us that scaffolding would be up outside the hotel and obscure the hotel i.e. we\'re having an event and it would be useful to inform people! \r\nThey were unable to grasp the \'bill back\' policy for our travel company, which took days and hours of sorting, which despite efforts was only resolved on check-out when they tried to charge my card (again). \r\nToo many other instances of poor organisation and service, that I wouldn\'t stay there again. Hugely disappointing for what should have been a simple stay. \r\nIf you\'re looking for bed and board then the Hudson Hotel is pleasant and has a good location. If you need anything more, forget it. \r\nI think there are plenty of better hotels to stay in.'
3,'Not the best!','Stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early Jan 2007 for 2 nights with my husband. We arrived at the hotel at the time advised to hotel by our travel agent to be greeted in a very unfriendly manner by the receptionist. We had pre-paid for rooms but there was a tense moment when apparently no free rooms could be found; this apparently was our fault as all the other guests have checked in???!! Anyway, we were allocated a room but it was not really of the standard I was anticipating - very small and musty smelling (probably not a room that\'s used often) with a view of the internal courtyard. I imagine we would have got a better room if booked direct with hotel. \r\nFacilities in the room are okay - nice toiletries, tea and coffee facilities (though these were not replaced during our stay) and minibar (water was $3 though I think! Usually free now in most good hotels...) Aside from teh receptionist, other staff encountered were very friendly and exceptionally helpful - as were the locals in general! The hotel has a reputation for its beautiful lobby and it certainly lives up to that particular expectation. It\'s also reputed to be the longest operating hotel in the US... it\'s starting to show its age in some aspects!!\r\nThe location is good however (though not as lively as hotels located around Michigan Avenue); reasonably close to Monroe El stop (we came from airport by train as it\'s so cheap - only $2!) and within walking distance of the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Chicago is a fantastic city - I loved it and will definitely return sooner rather than later, but I\'ll be looking for a different hotel!'
5,'Excellent experience','I stayed here during a business trip but brought my family along. We arrived around 9am fully expecting that our room would not be ready, but they immediately let us in. The room had a terrible smoking smell. I notified the front desk and they immediately gave us a new room. \r\nThe room was very clean, incredibly spacious for NYC standards and had a wonderful view. The housekeeping did a great job with timely room clean up. Also any housekeeping requests like extra coffee and real cream were promptly delivered along with bottled water for the coffee machine. \r\nThe gym on site is very good. Large set of treadmills is overlooking Times Square. It was a very enjoyable work out experience.\r\nThere are two Starbucks shops on site along with stores, many restaurants and lounge areas. The hotel is really a spectacle and of course the rooms are pricier for that reason. There is a Food Emporium behind the hotel on 8th avenue and were able to stock up on snacks, water, fresh fruit without paying a high price at the hotel. \r\nThere are several Subway stations and ACE line is right on the same street as the hotel. Very convenient for exploring other parts of Manhattan or going to work Downtown. \r\nI recommend this hotel for first time visitors especially because of the location and wonderful comfort of this hotel. \r\nI have previously stayed in a Corner King but this time had two double beds. The room with two double beds had a very nice seating area, with two big chairs and a table, in addition to a large desk. The corner king had a sofa and a coffee table next to the corner window.'
5,'Posizione strategica nel cuore di New York','Siamo stati a New York all\'inizio di aprile e abbiamo soggiornato in una camera Atrium Club del Westin. Si tratta di alcune camere che danno accesso ad una serie di privilegi, come l\'ingresso alla sala fitness (ben attrezzata e con bella vista) e all\'Atrium Club Lounge, uno spazio riservato dove è possibile consumare la prima colazione inclusa o l\'aperitivo serale con soft drinks e spuntini (tutto compreso nella tariffa). Inoltre le atrium rooms sono molto ampie, pulite e hanno tutte un iMac con internet free incluso. Devo dire che questa scelta ci ha pienamente soddisfatti e la qualità del cibo offerto nella lounge è molto buona. Per il resto l\'hotel si contraddistingue per la posizione incredibile nel quartiere dei teatri e Times Square e per l\'eccezionale comodità del letto. Di ottima qualità anche i prodotti da bagno e la super doccia a doppio getto. Lo consigliamo'
5,'The New Yorker Well Recommended.','The New Yorker is situated in one of the Hotspots of Nyc,its very convinent and is only minutes away from Times Square,Its also right by the Subway Penn Station which is very handy for getting about. Me and my brother stayed there for seven nights and had no problems,The place was clean and friendly,the only encounter we did have was one of the ladIes at reception was quite moody,but she could of just been havin a bad day.\r\nOur stay was enjoyable,i would say traffic noise wasnt a problem for us as we were situated high up on 27th floor.One thing i would say was the room was smaller than i thought would be ,but everything was fine.I was very suprised to find a birthday card and complimentry chocolate truffels from the staff,which was very thoughtful and a lovely suprise.\r\nOne handy thing they do there is they can hold your luggage for you on your last day and only cost a dollar a bag and you can pick it up when you want.\r\nGenerally all the staff were friendly and polite and i would recommend staying there.\r\nOh also if you get the hotel cab they charge you a set rate to the airport so it works out alot better.'
5,'Trendy & Hip','Hudson hotel, wow, wat een trendy & hip hotel! Super mooi design! Van buiten is het al mooi maar als je dan de roltrap opgaat en je in de lobby uitkomt dan ben je helemaal om! Wat een fijne sfeer, vriendelijk personeel en erg mooie kamers met uitzicht over New York! De kamers zijn wel klein, een grote koffer kan er eigenlijk niet op de grond liggen! Het dakterras is geweldig met een mooi uitzicht over de stad! Perfect hotel op een erg mooie locatie. Om de hoek bij Central Park dus wat wil je nog meer. Zekers te weten een aanrader mocht je in New York verblijven.'
5,wonderful,'The service was excellent , they dont let just anyone into the hotel \r\nSecurity is great dont let the kids wonder around . \r\nThe price is a bit pricey but when u stay in time square u cant expect anything low \r\nit was a wonderuful place to stay being in the center of attention .\r\nRooms were clean and the beds are very comfortable\r\nloved my stay as well as my trip.'
4,'Great Location','I stayed here in Dec 2010 with my Boyfriend. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance from times square, macys, madison square gardens etc. The rooms are very small but i dont think that matters when in NYC as you arent in much. Had a great time in new york, will be returning soon and will stay in this hotel again. The tick tock dinner attached to the hotel is great, lovely food, great service.'
4,'Mitten in Manhatten','Mehrfacher Besuch dieses Hotels z. t. fuer Business aber auch Privat. \r\nGrosses impossantes elegantes Hotel mit einer tollen Empangshalle.\r\nEs liegt direkt neben dem Grand Central Bahnhof. Von daher ein sehr guter Ausgangspunkt sowohl fuer Business als auch fuer Private Reisen.\r\nEbenfalls nur ein kurzes Stueck von der 5 th Avenue. \r\nAuch ein guter Ausgangspunkt fuer Besichtigungen.\r\nDas Hotel bietet sehr gute Restaurants inkl. einem reichhaltigem Fruehstuecksbuffet. Ebenso eine gemuetliche Bar...sowie eine kleine Shopping Arkade uvm.\r\nDie Zimmer sind angenehm eingerichtet in neutralen Toenen und sauber. \r\nDie Betten sind komfortabel mit genug Kissen und Decken.\r\nDer Service hier ist sehr gut und hilfsbereit.'
5,'Fantastic location & great hotel','We started our USA vacation with New York and this hotel and what a wonderful start it was. Our flight landed early in the morning and though the checkin time was 3 PM, the front office staff let us checkin at 11 AM without any extra charges. \r\nThe location is fantastic, a short stroll to Central Park and a subway station within 5 mins walk. The room was quite large by New York hotel standards, well appointed, very comfy beds. Bathroom was kind of small but then this is NY !!\r\nThe hotel is oldish and has a slightly dated look but everything is kept in ship-shape order. All staff we dealt with were very helpful. The breakfast buffet was wonderful.\r\nWe were there on a weekend and there was a kind of flea market going on the road outside the hotel which we really enjoyed visiting. Starbucks is right across and several other nice restaurants at walking distance.\r\nOverall a great hotel in a great location.'
2,'Construction noise is miserable','I had stayed here before when in town for business and always been pretty happy. This was a bad experience. I was awakened both mornings by 7 am with incredibly loud construction directly over my head. I called the second morning to say isn\'t there some way you can put this off until 8? Basic answer: Nope, your bad luck to stay under our construction. They were very nice about the fact that they were unwilling to do anything to make the noise stop, and offered me a discount (useless on a business trip) or some points. I took the points (would rather be able to sleep until 8 am), and later the same day needed to extend my NY trip by a day. Hotel sold out. I thought, well, supposedly they were sorry that they made it impossible for me to sleep after 7 am, I bet they can find me a room - that\'s something that would actually be helpful and not even cost them anything. Nope, we don\'t have a single room in the entire hotel anywhere that you can stay in, and anyway we gave you points. Last trip to the Grand Hyatt - my semi-regular business trips to NY are shifting hotels.'
4,'Bello, pulito, comodo. Fantastico!','Sono stato all\'Hudson per le vacanze di natale 2007/2008 e devo dire che è stato un soggiorno splendido. \r\nL\'aspetto relativamente negativo è che le stanze sono un po\' piccole, ma assolutamente nella media degli Hotel di New York, e in ogni caso sono delle stanze pulitissime è molto molto carine e moderne. Il bagno è spazioso ed ha la vasca. \r\nAssolutamente da frerquentare la lobby dell\'hotel, il bar molto posh) e il ristorante, davvero buono.\r\nLo consiglio a chiunque.\r\nUn consiglio fatevi dare una camera ad un piano alto. Sia per la vista, sia per che nelle stanze basse - dicono - si possa sentire il rumore del bar della lobby sempre in festa. Io ero al 14esimo e dormivo sogni tranquilli.'
5,'Great Location!!','If you can afford it, stay here!! The rooms are pretty expensive ($270+ a night) but it\'s worth it to able to walk out of your hotel right into Times Square!! This hotel is near top notch restaurants, the theatre district, and the subway is not a far walk at all. The rooms are of average size. It\'s a huge place and pretty busy. The staff was always very helpful. The restaurant in the hotel is pretty expensive so I would try some of the local cuisine if you are up for walking before I spend my money here. I hope to go back soon!!'
4,'Decent, clean, good value','This is an older hotel in the Garment district, about a 10 minute walk from Times Square. The Lobby and other common areas are clean and elegant, elevators are fast and frequent. There are some neat deco details throughout the hotel, most original, it looked like. The suite we had featured a living area with a mini-fridge and sofa bed and a bedroom with 2 double beds. All beds, including the sofa bed, were very comfortable with tempur-pedic type mattresses. The bedroom and living area were both small, but fine for a short stay. There was a large entry way with a 2 closets, one of them quite large. Our room had a great view of the Empire State building and also had a large terrace, (which had no furniture, so you couldn\'t really use it) The only negative was the bathroom, which was very small, though clean. We were told the room was a renovated room, though I would call it more of a redecoration than a renovation as there were definite signs of age in the bath area. \r\nContinental breakfast is available for the concierge/corporate level rooms and has a good variety of cereals, pastries and fruit and the view from the dining area is fabulous, though seating is limited. The Tick-Tock diner in the lobby of the hotel was actually quite good and reasonably priced. Across the street is a Starbucks and in the other direction, a good restaurant, Lucy\'s, which features Mexican and has good Margaritas, though they don\'t allow kids after 5 PM. \r\nHotel is very close to Penn Station, less than a 3 minute walk. You can leave your luggage for $1/bag after you check out. Staff were great, from check-in to housekeeping.'
4,'Would stay here again.','Great Midtown location. Checking in and out was a breeze and the staff was very polite. We stayed on the 21st floor and the elevators were speedy. The size of the room was what we expected for NYC...very small. However, it was clean with contemporary furniture and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom needs to be updated. Although it was clean, paint was chipping away in spots and floor tile caulk looked a little dirty from what I imagine is just normal buildup. Overall, I would stay here again.'
4,'Good value for money with great location','Convenient, central location. Fast (5 min.) check in and out. Hotel fitness center adequate (2 good ellipticals, 4 treadmills, 2 bikes and a universal) but if you\'ve got more time to work out maybe try their discount at a full scale club next door. My room had a good, comfortable king sized mattress, everything in working order, looked recently renovated except bathroom which was clean and functional but original tile and fixtures. Overall found the hotel good value for the money and fine for a business trip.'
5,'Ultimo dell\'anno a New York','Già stato nel 2008 quando erano in corso lavori di ristrutturazione sono ritornato perchè penso che sia uno degli Hotel più funzionali di NY, posizione eccellente,personale eccellente,camere piccole ma pulite, adotto il sistema che le camere servono per dormire quindi le dimensioni bastano l\'indispensabile.Inoltre da non scartare, essendo l\'alberhgo grande difficie non trovale posto.In ultimo la forma architettonica ti ricorda la NT degli anni trenta ed anche questo non è male, se poi ti trovi al 38° avrai una vista inimmaginabile sulla statua della Libertà, cosa avuta nel 2008 ma non nel 2010. inoltre puoi andare a vedere una bella partita di basket nel sottostante Madison Square Garden\r\nDelfo'
4,'magnifica ubicacion','estuvimos 5 dias alojados en el hyatt,la ubicacion es perfecta al lado mismos del grand central y 5 minutos andando de times square y rockefeller center,el hotel es inmenso con un hall espectacular pero eso no quita para que traten bien, en recepcion si no sabes ingles pregunta por Leo que si lo habla,las habitaciones estan bien pero el baño me parecio pequeño,lo mejor de todo ha sido el colchon de lo mejor que he visto, el desayuno es caro nosotros no lo contratamos y acertamos porque en el hall hay a modo de un supermarket donde puedes desayunar,ya que tienen de todo'
4,'Family time in NYC','After spending a lot of time checking out hotel websites we decided on the Affiina Manhattan. The reviews, location, room sizes and price seemed to fit what we required for our family with two kids under nine. It was a good choice. We booked directly with the hotel..the best rate we could find. Check in was smooth. The room was an excellent size and recentlly decorated. Two very comfortable queen beds with plenty of room to move around, a plus for four people. The bathroom was very large with great water pressure. Tub had bit of scrapes on it, but no big deal. The room was clean. We were on the 7th floor and I would have to say that you do know you are in New York City, because you can certainly hear the street noises into the night. There is a window air conditioner which allows a bit more street noise into the room. Not really sure if a higher floor would make a difference. If you were a light sleeper, it could be an issue. For us it was not a big deal as everyone was tired by the end of the day and it really wasn\'t always apparent. \r\nA nice sized flat screen tv was mounted on the wall. \r\nWe are two blocks from Macy\'s and a few more after that and you are at Times Square. A couple of blocks from the subway. If we wanted to get to Central Park, the subway is the best bet. You can walk it, but after going a few times it can seem a long way when your days are full of walking. Central Park was a favourite with our kids as there is a great park there. \r\nThis hotel did not disappoint. It was great for our family.'
1,'I Hate This Hotel!','I\'ve stayed at this hotel numerous times over the past 15 years. Why? Because my company refuses to book another hotel.\r\nHere\'s what\'s wrong:\r\nToo expensive for what you get relative to other midtown hotels.\r\nAlmost always have to endure noisy construction going on in a room near yours.\r\nAt least 1 lamp and/or appliance not working.\r\nRidiculously long lines at all hours at the front desk.\r\nFinally, as if that isn\'t enough reasons to avoid this place..\r\nBED BUGS.'
2,'Just OK is not enough for a luxury hotel - and the Hyatt is not even ok.','Picked the hotel because close to business location for the day and usually Hyatt delivers modern value. Just coming from a business trip to China and staying in 4 & 5 star hotels there; the contrast coudn\'t be greater. This is Hyatt has sure nothing Grand.\r\nCheckin was done in person and after waiting in line for (it felt like) an eternity, the VERY friendly and helpful lady checked me in and answered questions I had for my stay and the area. She was GREAT and very friendly. Truely mae me feel welcome. Only issue were all the people in line behind me who didn\'t get to check in because of the limited staff.\r\nThe room itself ( premium???) is sparse. no work desk; no bathrope, no slipper. No ammenities like nail file or cotton buds. No stocked minibar or complimentary drinking water... \r\nBut... they charge over $30 for internet access. Per device! per day! Having 3 mobile devices this alone would be a deal killer for my next NYC stay. Loud in the room, noise form the hallway is like the doors are made from paper.\r\nremote for the radio next to the bed? didn\'t work .. (so I took the battery out in the morning and put the remote (and battery) on the nightstand for the maid to fix. Found it at the same place in the evening... still not working.\r\nThe two glasses provided in the room? Not even looking clean... \r\nBut getting better... tonight (at 10 pm) they turned of the water supply for urgent repairs. \r\nNo offer to change rooms... some some bottled water to brush teeth was offered. What to do after the workout .... ? get to bed without a shower...? And not be able to flush the toilett until the morning...? come on... you can\'t rent such a room (and sure not on these rates).\r\nThere are definetly MUCH better options in NY; especially if paying over $300 per night and booking in advance. And for sure the last time I picked the Hyatt here.'
5,'fantastic location','fantastic location at times square, superb size room with air conditioning. good view over the city.'
5,'The reviews are so wrong!!!','I was so afraid when booking the Crown Plaza after I read the reviews. I called and upgraded our room to club level and requested a broadway view. We arrived At 12:30pm and went straight to our room and the checkin was a breeze the staff was very friendly. We had room 4402. It was a corner room with the entire room almost being windows. one side faced the Hudson river and the other side was Time Square. The only problem was our view was slightly obstructed on the time square side due to a brick wall. But overall it was a fantastic room. Very large and more space than we needed. It was very clean and the towels were very large unlike what I had read in an earlier review. My friend forgot her toothbrush and we called the front desk and in less than 2 minutes someone was knocking on our door with the toothbrush and toothpaste. We had access to the Club lounge for breakfast and evening drinks and snacks and both were very good. Breakfast is not hot food just muffins, ceral and bagels. But was perfect for us. I would definitly stay here again!!! it is so close to everything and is very nice. I would recommend upgrading to the club level.'
1,maroooooo,'posizione ottima...l\'unica cosa positiva....abbiamo soggiornato all\'hotel 4 giorni per fortuna l\'hotel non rispecchia per niente la descrizione...le camere non sono assolutamente quelle che si vedono nelle foto.....buie e maleodoranti come tutto l\'hotel c\'è moquet dappertutto quindi c\'è quell\'odore sgradevole di polvere ovunque...oltretutto come se non bastasse una sera c\'è stato un\'incendio ad uno dei piani hanno fatto evaquare....io ero appena uscita dalla doccia quindi con capelli bagnati e ci hanno fatto rientrare in camera dopo quasi 5 ore.....stavamo tutti buttati nella hall sembrava il viaggio della speranza.....\r\ncmq..fortunatamente siamo stati poco perche fuori c\'è altro da vedere...new york è fantastica......'
4,'Ottima posizione, se in promozione ottimo affare','Posizione ottima per visitare la parte alta della città a piedi, ma vicino a due linee della metro per potersi spostare comodamente. Ad un paio di isolati da central park. \r\nStruttura moderna e pulita, servizio e accoglienza al banco non molto accogliente, camera sufficientemente spaziosa e letto comodo, stanza abbastanza insonorizzata.\r\n Niente wifi gratis (ma dall\'atrio ci si riesce a connettere alla rete di uno starbucks confinante con i muri dell\'hotel), niente colazione e deposito bagagli a 3/4$ dollari al giorno per bagaglio (se arrivate prima del checkin è l\'unica soluzione). \r\nSul loro sito ho visto che le tariffe sono spesso in promozione, provate a dare un\'occhiata.'
4,'Amazing, comfortable beds','This is my second time staying at Grand Hyatt in midtown Manhattan. The location is amazing - right above Grand Central. The room is nice enough. But I especially like the bed. It is so comfortable.'

1,ew,'We walked into the room and we so grossed out we immediately got on the phone and tried to book another hotel. Due to the fact that we had amazing Tarzan tickets we were unable to get out of there that night, but we left promptly at 8am the next morning. The hotel is in such a need of renovation its pathetic. The yellow glue is showing through the probably 20 year old wallpaper. The sheets are clean, but there are so old they are yellow. 30 minutes of wireless internet costs $3.95, the Hilton has it for $9.25 for 24 hours. Upon arrival we found someone elses hair on the bathroom floor. The floor hasnt been swept in a long time, and I didnt want to sit on any of the furniture it was so unclean. The Hilton is $30 more. GO THERE....NOW!! We did!'
4,'Great hotel.....but don\'t book excursions.','The beds are amazing. The location for a tourist is first class. It\'s clean and the staff are helpful. I went with my wife and two teenagers and enjoyed saying here. Just two things to watch out for are the minibar which for a can of coke costs around $8 (£5/6) and there is no price list in the room. The other thing is excursions booked through the concierge desk. The key point here is that they are a third party outsourced service not directly linked to the hotel. So if something goes wrong, the hotel cannot directly instruct them or refund moneys, etc. We booked two family tickets to the Harry Potter and Pompeii exhibitions on Times Square and was told they were discounted because the hotel was running a promotion. Turns out they were $80 more expensive than the door price and made getting a refund very difficult and were very rude. Use the concierge only for a good recommend (Westway Diner was great for breakfast with the locals), just don\'t part with any money.'
4,'Loved it, but pricey.','Lovely hotel, spotless clean, great size rooms. \r\nNice bar, small convieniece store, atm downstairs.\r\nNice friendly staff throughout.\r\nWe were on honeymoon and they sent us up a lovely fruit basket and bottle of champers :) \r\nUsed the business centre for 5 mins once and it cost $10 \r\nAlso it was extra to use pool which we didn\'t so I can\'t really comment.\r\nWould stay again!'
3,'Executive Floor Service','I had the pleasure of meeting Ernest. He was very kind. After the first day of visiting the breakfast area, he would have my choice of breakfast ready when he saw me approaching. He was more than accommodating and he went beyond his normal duties to be sure that I got everything I needed before leaving. He was very pleasant and his professionalism cannot be measured with words. He really made the stay at Palmer House a pleasure. -Ms Monique Hicks'
4,'Location and Service','Steps from Central Park, Carnegie Hall, City Center, great restaurants, shopping. \r\nRight at check in you\'ll feel welcome by Guest Services managers. Ricky Alvarez helped me getting an early check in and later in the day helped me with a problem with my computer. People like that are definitely a great asset to any hotel, compensating for other things a property migh lack in other areas.\r\nThere are a few problems with this property like: Lack of pressure on the showers, dated forniture, the elevators are very slow in the morning, loud maids in the morning, old carpeting, funny smell in some of the rooms (I had to go to a nearby Duane Reade to buy air freshener).\r\nOverall, it\'s location and customer service are good enough reasons to stay there.'
5,'Fantastic Hudosn','The Hudson is a fantastic hotel in a great location near to Central Park and walking distance of some excellent restaurants. It is stylish, trendy although one downside is the size of the bedrooms - very very small but compact! The Rooftop garden is fabulous with beautiful furnishings and a great view across the City. The bars were busy and very trendy - overall we enjoyed our second trip to this hotel and would certainly go again.'
3,'Pésimo servicio, excelente ubicación','Fuimos a NY para asistir a un congreso y nos alojaron en el Marriott Marquis (2 habitaciones dobles y dos individiuales). La ubicación del hotel y las instalaciones son excelentes, pero el servicio que se da al cliente es pésimo.\r\nEl primer día nos ofrecieron un cambio gratuito a una habitación con vistas, que se realizaría al día siguiente. En el momento de hacer el cambio nos dicen que tiene coste, así que hablamos con la supervisora, que nos mantiene la oferta gratuita y nos pide que nos cambiemos por la tarde, ya que las habitaciones no están listas. Llega la tarde y tenemos el mismo problema que por la mañana: nos dicen que tenemos que pagar, así que volvemos a reclamar hasta que al final nos cambian las habitaciones, pero una de ellas tiene una sola cama en vez de dos. Volvemos a reclamar y nos dicen que no les quedan habitaciones de dos camas con vistas, con lo cual al final cambiamos las dos habitaciones individuales y las otras dos las dejamos como están.\r\nAdemás de esto, realizan un cargo de unos 740 euros en la tarjeta de crédito de dos de los asistentes sin motivo alguno (el hotel ya estaba pagado). Vamos a reclamar y nos dicen que el cargo es incorrecto y, sin darnos más explicaciones, se llevan las tarjetas para devolvernos el dinero, tardando más de 40 minutos en devolvernoslas. Llamo al banco y me dicen que el cargo sigue ahí, teniendo que arreglar el problema yo mismo por teléfono, con el coste que supone llamar en itinerancia desde USA a España.\r\nEl día en que nos volvemos a España en el taxi nos meten nuestras maletas y la de otra persona. Eso para nosotros no supone ningún perjuicio, pero me imagino la faena que le habrán hecho al huésped que dejaron sin equipaje.\r\nEn definitiva, un hotel muy bonito y con una buena situación, pero con el peor servicio que he recibido nunca.'
4,'situation formidable','situation formidable sur times square \r\nAyant deja été à l edison qui est juste à coté , je peux vous dire que c est un autre monde , un autre confort , et ne parlons pas de la propreté ... \r\nNous étions au 41 eme etage , rien entendu de la ville , pas l impression d être en plein centre . Chambe spacieuse pour un couple et deux enfants , propre , et vue sur hudson river. superbe salle de fitness, et personnel attentif .\r\nA conseiller'
2,Deceiving,'My first impression when i came into palmers was  this is beautiful i am going to have a great stay That feeling died when i got to my smaller than average room and minimalistic bathroom. Since i was there for business, i needed internet, Which wasn t complimentary and my port was out of service the second day. No complimentary breakfast and each time i called for assistance, i was put on hold for 5 minutes At least since they were busy. \r\nGreat looking lobby And location but that is it'
4,'Broadway show and weekend in NYC','I will start by saying we had a great time. It was the perfect location. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Everything was extremely expensive, but we knew to expect this, after all you are in the middle of time square. Buffet breakfast was $30 per person, plus tax and tip. In all fairness they had everything you could expect from a breakfast buffet. Eggs were made to order and fruit was deliciously fresh, and they had all the other breakfast fixings. We had dinner at the broadway lounge. Again expensive, but we were overlookingg time square and the mahi mahi, the strip steak and the margarita\'s were really good, We also had dinner at the view and it was a waste of money. Don\'t bother. We had eaten here many years ago, and remembered a totaly different experience. This is going to be a whole seperate review.\r\nBack to the marquis, customer service was just OK, check in went smooth and after requesting a room with a view and holding a $20 bill in my hand, so they would know that I would tip them, they gave us one (room 2037). I think it is the place to stay if you are spending a weekend in NYC and catching a broadway show. Just dont expect all of the special treatment or amenities that would normaly come with this price. You are paying for the location and the view from your rooms.'
4,'Posizione perfetta','Il suggerimento e\' di prendere una camera all esecutive color se intra nel vostro budget . Alla fine conviene: colazione inclusa, aperitivo dalle 5 alle 7 molto buono con stuzzichi cinesi, camere spaziose, bagno microscopico ma lindo, molto essenziale. Tutto ripagato dalla posizione perfetta e dal funzionamento impeccabile dei servizi. Hotel molto fidato. Ho dimenticato iPhone e telefonino alla partenza e sono rientrata allarmantissima, era tutto già nella stanza della Security ....con qualche doverosa domanda, mi e stato tutto consegnato...'
1,'It\'s what you get for the price we paid','____________________________________________________________________\r\n----------Advantages------------\r\nGreat location. \r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\n--------Disadvantages----------\r\nTaken from the website, Inside our property, you\'ll find beautifully renovated rooms, with new furniture and carpeting, a comfortable work desk with reading lamp, flat screen color televisions, AM/FM clock radios, telephones with voice mail, individual air conditioning and climate control.\r\nThat description was far from the many rooms that Hotel Pennsylvania has to offer. That description fits for only 1\% of the hotel rooms, which will cost hundreds more. Misleading, of course. \r\nWe booked a total of 3 rooms, each having appliances. I had no fridge, the other had a tiny fridge, and the other had a larger fridge. The floors where extremely dirty, you can definitely see how terrible the room/cleaning services are just by looking at the floor and the bathroom. As soon as I entered the room, a stench of foul odor and the dirty environment really steps you back, even my wife called me cheap. Well I didn\'t expect the rooms to look like this, especially since they are apparently the Most popular hotel and Visitor friendly. All three rooms where dirty, mine being the dirtiest :(\r\nThe line up in the check-in was loooooong. The line up was close to reaching the entrance doors and they only had 2-3 services checking them in. I had to wait an hour! The bell man was RUDE RUDE RUDE. We bought a 12pack Green Tea Lipton icetea because it\'s expensive to buy it from coffee shops and all. We told him to take everything in the back trunk, and that included our drinks. Guess what? He opened it and said, I might just get myself one. in front of my kids. They told me soon afterward, and I just told them \'ok that\'s his tip.\' While I was lining up to check-in, my cousin (who was with me on another car) told me he came up to him asking for a tip, he was persistent too. I was mad at him of course. But I didn\'t see him again unfortunately. We paid him $10 and a drink just for him to bring them in the lobby. Yes, the lobby which we could have done effortlessly and for free... but he didn\'t tell us that we have to get another bell man inside to bring it upstairs to our rooms. At least the other bell man we got was nicer. Horrible services and staff!\r\nI don\'t believe there was a pool, if there was, I surely wouldn\'t want to go. \r\nThe lobby looked pretty nice for what is a \'1-star hotel\', but after going up, the elevator was much like a time portal bringing you back to the WW1 theme. Ugly ugly ugly. The doors for the rooms had some weird design as if it was purely designed for stopping 30mm bullets.... The framing was made out of wood and was rotting. The paint on the wall was chipping. The window was stuck. The bathtub\'s paint was also peeling off. The ceiling paint was peeling off, and every so often some will fall on you. Door knob for bathroom was sticky. Soap was opened and used. Toilet was tainted yellow. Mirror was dirty. Bathroom lighting kept blinking. Floors where dirty, dusty, and stained. Last but not least - it stunk. Go figure. \r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\nAnyways, the location was great, facing Madison Square Garden and a few blocks away from Empire State Building. I would NEVER recommend this hotel, especially since it\'s expensive but yet \'cheap\' in NY. I will pay more next time to get a better and comfortable stay in some other hotel. \r\nSTAY AWAY!!!'
4,'Great place at a great price!','We had a large, clean spacious room ! We were very happy with what we got for the price. It is an older hotel so dont expect the room to be anything fancy. The location is great and it has a coffee shop and restaurants right in the building for convenience. Customer service was not the greatest, just dont loose your room key(long lines), or call for any type of service(no answer) and you\'ll be fine!'
4,'New Yoker Hotel - recent review','We were not sure what to expect having read many mixed reviews on the New Yorker Hotel but we were delighted with our room on the 19th floot. Spacious with two double beds and an en suite at either end of the room. The TV was excellant and easy to use. The room was clean with a daily maid service.\r\nThe elevators were plentifull with 5 serving the first 20 floors. They were speedy and reliable - just 19 seconds from the lobby to the 19th.\r\nLocation is fantastic. Just a short to walk to Macy\'s and Daffy\'s. Madison Square garden is very close with the Empire state buliding only another 5 min stroll.Times square is also wthin easy walking distance.\r\nThe Tick Tock diner annexed to the hotel is busy especially in the mornings and we had to queue once to get in but the service is quick but not always polite.Food quality was ok but more expensive than expected.The Coopers Tavern annexed on the other side is more up market with very good food but again not that cheap. The beer was expensive at 8 dollars a glass.\r\nHotel staff were all polite and professional and willing to help in any way.\r\nThere were rennovations going on in the main lobby and therefore a shortage of sitting which was a nuisance when waiting to get picked up for a our return to the airport.\r\nIf I were to return to New York I would certainly consider staying at the New Yorker again.'
4,'Location hard to beat','Was recommended this hotel by friends and although at time of booking were able to find cheaper accomodation, have no regrets whatsoever. Hotel in ideal location across from madison Square garden, a ten min walk from time square and Empire state. Bus from across the road brings you to Battery city park for ferries to statue of liberty and Ellis Island. Room spacious, kitchenette with full size fridge, huge bed, pillow menu, although ensuite a bit on small side. All spotlessly clean. Reception staff, doormen, conceirge all excellent. Nothing too much bother. Gave helpful info on restaurants and visiting tourist sites. We\'ll be back.'
5,'Great, friendly hotel','We stayed for 11 nights in a 1 bed apartment (using sofa bed in lounge for 2 children). The room was spacious, really well decorated and furnished with a very useful little kitchen. Service in the hotel was really friendly and helpful, especially the front desk. Great hotel that we\'ll be using again.'
4,'Great Place to Stay','We stayed there on 7/24/07 - 7/28/07 - about a week after the steam pipe explosion. It is very well located because it is right at Grand Central Station. When you walk outside there are lots of people around and you do feel safe. We also saw quite a few police officers which was good. Right up the street is the soup man restaurant or the Soup Nazi as Seinfeld called him. They do have great crab bisque. There is a great japanese restaurant about 3 blocks away called Riki which had amazing sushi & the best fried rice at reasonable prices.\r\nBack to the hotel - we found the rooms to be upscale, well kept, and clean. Our bath was also clean. The lobby is nice and the gym was also. The gym was free which is unusual for most upper class hotels. We paid about $211 per night plus tax which is very good in NYC. We felt that it was a good rate for the hotel & location. The concierge was helpful finding places for us - told us about Riki. They were very busy so sometimes you had to wait a little bit before you got help. We would definitely stay there again. \r\nYou are 4-5 blocks from Times Square and you can catch the S train shuttle which only goes from Times Square - Grand Central Station and back. Very convienant to use the subway & bus. We bought a week pass for $24 each and you can use it for unlimited subway & bus rides. Well worth it and saved us plenty.'
1,'Worst hotel I have ever stayed in... AVOID!','We had originally booked to stay the Penn Hotel for 4 nights but had to leave after the 1st night. The room was tiny, out-dated and filthy. Bed was barely made. Staff were rude, slow and not very helpful. Although they did waive the $50 early check-out fee.\r\nThe location was good, but it definitely didn\'t out-weigh all the negatives.'
4,'What You\'d Expect','There was nothing really negative about this property - Its pretty much what you\'d expect from the Hyatt - no real wow factor.\r\nThe room had modern decor, very hip colors and style. We had a dbl bed and a sofa with a nice size table. The room was clean and the bed was very comfy. The staff was pretty much average in that we had no problems but no one went out of there way or anything. I think you would be happy with your stay here. Close to Bryant Park. Make sure you stroll over for bite or coffee - very pretty. About 10-15 min walk to Times Square'
4,'Great location','We were very happy with our stay at The New Yorker. The location is great! Penn Station is down the street. It is very close to Times Square. We walked there and felt safe day and night. The Empire State building is a few blocks away and we could see it from our room. We had a view room\r\nwith 2 beds. The size of the room was good. The bathroom was small and could use some work but it was clean. The front desk staff was very helpful. If you are driving there it is hard to find a space to park for valet. We had to drive around 5 times before a space was available. We would stay here again.'
4,'Classy place, great location!','We stayed here in September for one night. We picked it based on location and availablity (walkable to Soldier Field, Grant Park, shopping, etc.).The hotel is gorgeous inside, and you instantly feel like you\'re in for a treat. Our room was large enough for the two of us with a king bed and updated bathroom. We stayed on one of the executive levels, which had a different elevator and lounge where breakfast was provided. We went on a Sunday morning around 9:45, and the place was totally crowded. We managed to get in to sneak a banana and some coffee and took it to our room to enjoy, since there was nowhere to sit. This along with the long wait we had to check in dinged the Palmer House from 5 stars to 4 for us, but we would gladly stay here again!'
3,'Great location and price','You get what you pay for. It\'s a great location, 3 or 4 minute walk to times square. Subway is across the street and down the street. It\'s an old hotel so don\'t expect anything fancy. Small rooms and bathrooms but clean. We had our room cleaned every day. Staff were very nice and helpful. Accommodating. Very busy hotel. We had a great time. The bed and pillow was comfy for me but may not be for everyone. Even got us a cab.'
2,'Worst Hilton I\'ve been in my life','To start with service was abysmal, very common in the US. \r\nWhen will waiters understand that I do not care what their name is, I am not their pal and they are here to serve me an not sell a service, the minimum I expect from a staff is to be called sir (a good waiter is someone you do not notice).\r\nThe hotel is perfectly located, the room was quite nice, I had lounge access, which to be honest was one of the best one I was able to sample (European lounges do not seems to be so nice). \r\nOne issue is that the Lounge is big and only 2 computers to connect to internet were available.\r\nNow going down to the service:\r\nchecking out and leaving suitcases to store, they keep talking together and do not even look at you? sorry no tip.\r\nat the bar, 5 TV showing basket ball, one showing golf, one of the person wanted as well to watch basket ball, I complained, but program was changed, I hope the waiter got the tip from the other client (because he did not get anything from me).\r\nOtherwise the location is very good, ant it seems that you got the best Kebap cart down the place, people queuing all night long.\r\nIf the staff was not so arrogant will have ranked the place higher.\r\ntill now the best staff I had in New-York were part time workers (students) from Africa.'
5,'Great hotel for this family of 5 visiting NYC','My family of 5 (mom, dad, 2 teenage girls, tween boy) stayed in a 1 bedroom suite for 3 days on the 42nd floor. The room was terrific! Great linens, comfy beds, plenty of room, walk-in closet (handy for changing in when you have both genders), extra sink, pull out sofa, great water pressure in shower, and CLEAN! All the things you like to have in a hotel room. At check-in, they offered free wi-fi during our entire stay in exchange for giving up one day\'s maid service. Awesome!! Who needs maid service every day of their stay? Wi-fi in your room is usually an extra $15 per day. Many guests hang out in the lobby to get the free wi-fi, but we didn\'t have to! Breakfast was included as well as appetizers & softdrinks from 5-7 pm each evening. Very nice amenity. The location was awesome, too. Very convenient to subway, Times Square, shopping, etc. Hotel staff was friendly, pleasant and helpful. I would DEFINITELY stay here again.'
5,'service and location','I am a frequent guest at that hotel. Service at front desk is excellent. I would like to recommend especially Ms. Vicky and Ms. Hagar. They are very professional, helpful and efficient.\r\nI will certainly be a future guest.'
1,'Never Again','While conveniently located, this hotel is nothing like the photos on the web. I booked through a reputable online discount site and had to request a room change 3 times before I was even willing to stay the night. I found the hallways and rooms shabby and depressing. Two of the rooms I was given appeared not to have been upgraded for over 50 years and the housekeeping standards are very low. The staff ranged from helpful to clueless to surly. I would never return to this hotel, and not only would I never send a friend there, I have been telling friends to avoid it.'
2,'Remarkably Bad, Even by New York Standards','I am a frequent business traveler to New York, and have grown accustomed to poor quality accomodations at less expensive (meaning sub-$300) hotels. I stayed at the Hilton New York with my wife and baby, for a combination business trip and mini-vacation. I selected this hotel because the SIFMA conference, the reason for my business trip, was located there.\r\nThe facilities were quite mediocre, trending towards poor. The room was musty, and the ventilation system was difficult to control, leading to alternations from too hot and damp to too cold and damp. I\'m told that upper floors have been renovated, but my 27th floor room was definitely behind the times. Bathroom and bed were adequate.\r\nI had been lead to believe that internet service was included with my room reservation, but the front desk wasn\'t interested in my opinion. I heard two other travelers complain about the same thing. Network cost $15-20 per day for varying levels of access. Each device had to be paid for separately. And the $20 High Speed option was greatly inferior to my cable modem at home. We just used our cell phones instead.\r\nThe housekeeping staff were the worst I have ever had in a 4 star hotel. They did not change the sheets when they said they would, did not reliably remove dishes, and sometimes removed dirty items without replacing them. About the only thing they could be counted on for was clean towels. That, and leaving the window open. Given that it was 80 degrees and thunder storming, that probably contributed to the room being damp.\r\nMid-town is always a boring location for a vacation (unless you want to spend all your time at Broadway shows), and I knew that when I picked the hotel.\r\nI think some guests were staying on cheap packages. If you can get in here for $200 a night, and know what to expect, then you might be happy. But if you are paying the $300 rack rate, you can definitely do better elsewhere.\r\nI\'m going back to the Hampton Inn Time Square North next time I have to stay in midtown.'
3,'Good location, but got tired of the crowds','I recently stayed at the Marriott Marquis with some friends. On the plus side, the location is fantastic (right on Times Square), there\'s a Starbucks in the lobby (for that morning caffeine blast), and the rooms are perfectly pleasant (nothing extraordinary, but clean and comfortable).\r\nOn the down side, it\'s seriously crowded. Throngs of people in every corner of the public spaces. The elevator system is ridiculous, in that you input your floor number on a keypad, then you are assigned an elevator; the problem is that there\'s no way for the system to tell how many people are requesting a given floor. On more than one occasion, my group had to redo the request two or three times before we could fit onto one of the crowded cars. It\'s a small thing, but it was annoying. \r\nAs a bit of advice, do not purchase show tickets from the kiosk in the hotel lobby. We were somewhat pressed for time and were exhausted after a long day exploring the city, so we we bought tickets there. Yes, we knew there would be a fee, probably more than we\'d consider fair, but we were not expecting an almost 50\% markup over the face price of the ticket. Since you are not allowed to see the tickets until two hours before the show begins, it\'s too late to change your plans. This was our mistake, one we will not repeat, but it was a serious irritation.'
5,'no complaints at pennsylvania','I stayed with my husband during the second week in June. The check in process only took 15 min. The staff answered all our questions patiently. After we checked in I asked for a fridge and they brought it immediately! IT is walking distance from all the major attractions. Penn station is across the street, fast foods and excellent restaurants around the corner. The housekeeping staff went out of their way to meet our every needs! We felt safe,the security guards would ask the guests to show our keys before entering the elevators. Our rooms were cleaned every day. we asked for a superior double bed room, and it was lovely!'
5,'Another Great Stay!','This is my second stay at this hotel and couldn\'t have been more pleased! I wrote a glowing review earlier for my wonderful stay back in January for the soap opera star Tamara Braun\'s event and I\'m back to gush some more! I have also posted the candid shots for this hotel, took some more and hopefully can post some more if they turn out. I very much enjoyed my stay! My friends and I were in NY May 20th-22nd for the Daytime Emmy Awards and to see some of the soap stars who were having events that weekend at this hotel! Basically everything went well. We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers Friday and the Marriott Marquis on Saturday and loved the Marriott much more. Firstly the Marquis\'s rooms were bigger, about our average sized hotel room across the US, but for NY standards large. The elevators were a problem, but considering they had tons of servicemen, including armed and naval, 23,000 kids and adults from the united nations organization, us soap opera fans and stars, and the average tourist and business traveler that is a whole lot of people staying in one place at one time. No wonder the elevator went down during the peak hrs. Afterwards they were back up and there was no problem. The new system is very easy to use and I was even showing others, who weren\'t sure, how the new system worked. When you first enter the elevator section you still had to choose left or right. Again all elevators went to floors 1-8. The left the elevators took you to floors 27 or 28 and above and the elevators on the right took you to floors 27 or 28 and below. This time instead of just pressing the up button and playing pot luck with the elevators, you punch in the number of the floor you want to go to and the key pad will bring up the elevator number and arrow pointing you in the direction of the elevator that will be taking you to your floor. They have signs posted everywhere and people at times assigned to help puzzled visitors with the new system. Most people tended to ignore the signs and employees who were there to help until they were confronted with the problem, but that I\'ve learned is in our nature. We don\'t seem to stop to read signs, maps, etc... unless we have to anymore. Sort of gets taken for granted. Anyways, any wait time for the elevators were negligible for us since we were confronted with the same problems with the elevators at the Sheraton on Friday and we weren\'t going to let elevators ruin our trip. All in all even when the elevators went down during their peak time the Marriott Marquis handled it well. Our room at 1056 didn\'t have much of a view, but the beds were wonderfully soft, the lights were working well, and there was space to move around in! The coffee machine and condiments weren\'t stashed in the bathroom and the water pressure was good compared to what may be found at other hotels. We went to the Rick Hearst event held at the Sky Lobby on the 16th floor. We hung out on the 8th floor where you check in and most of the restaurants at the hotel are located. The ladie\'s room on the 8th floor had a line at times and so I went and used the escalators down to the 4th floor and used the ones there. There was no lines and no wait and would highly recommend doing this for others who might not want to wait if there is a line. Also some reviewers had posted about keeping their room keys with them was really helpful and it is. I believe it was sometime after midnight and one in our party went downstairs to smoke outside the hotel and security apparently tightens after a certain time during the evening because they needed to see that she had a room key before she could get back in. We again skipped the View restaurant which opens at 4pm or so at least the sign broadcasted from the 3rd floor que where later people would be waiting in line for an elevator to take them to the restaurant. We went instead to Virgils and ate before my friend and I went over to the theatre where Denzel Washington was doing Julius Cesar. Apparently after the show he comes out to sign autographs and take pictures with his fans. Very important to have a playbill of the show for this. Anyways, check-out of the Marriott Marquis was fast via the express check out button on the telephone in the room. You leave your name and room number and all we had to do was to go to the 8th floor to turn in the room keys. The whole weekend was great and it was partly due to the Marriott Marquis! When next I\'m in NY I am more that willing to stay here again and would highly recommend it to others!:)'
5,'Great Hotel','Stayed here for 5 nights with my wife as a birthday/anniversary holiday. We had a large room on the 25th floor with the biggest bed I have ever slept in, plus a choice of pillows. \r\nBathroom was small but had everything including a very powerful shower. There was also a small kitchen with cooker, fridge, coffee maker etc but we only used the fridge for cool drinks. Neither of us wanted to cook on holiday, even breakfast. There was also a small store room for suitcases etc, good sized wardrobe, plenty of drawer of drawer space, TV etc. Decor was perhaps a little tired but we only slep there so it was perfectly acceptable.\r\nThe hotel is very well situated, opposite Madison Square Gardens. There is a great bar/ restaurant across the road - Harringtons. And a great bar called Seven a few doors down from it. Both well worth a visit.\r\nStaff were very courteous and helpful. Only slight drawback was a fire station on 31st and a police station on 32nd, so sirens went all night but then this is New York.\r\nAll in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.'
4,'Worth Staying Again','It is located on 42nd street next to Lexington avenue.We could see most of important places in Manhattan within 15/20 minute walk in all directions.It is just above Grand Central Station.The room was quite big from New york standard.The bathroom was also of a decent size.Though we had a room on 34th floor but still we could hardly see the sky ie typical New york. A 24 hour market shop in the lobby was a great idea.The club lounge was very good. The front desk and concierge staff was very helpful. On our last day our flight was in the evening and we wanted to check out at 2 instead of 11 which thew allowed us graciously. While booking the room online we found that a club category room was costing 100$ per day extra.In club room we got free breakfast for 2 people worth atleast 60$,free internet worth 10$,free tea/coffee/snacks/bottle water/fruit throught the day.It is worth paying 100$ extra and get a bigger room on higher floor.We will definately like to stay here again.'
1,'Staff needs customer service training','After saying I\'d never stay at this hotel again when I stayed here for a conference over 25 years again, I gave it another chance because it\'s in a good location. Big mistake! Then as now the staff do not understand that they have guests who have traveled a long way to be there and who stay up late at night to enjoy the city. The housekeeping staff were talking loudly in the hallway outside our room more than once over our four day stay. Apparently do not disturb means nothing to them. We arrived mid morning and our room was not available. This is understandable though unusual these days. The front desk clerk told us it would be ready by 1pm.. When we came back at one the new clerk told us they only guarantee 3pm arrival and not to expect anything better. I can see why. There is no sense of urgency in the work of the housekeeping staff. Every time we encountered them they were visiting with other workers and cleaning and talking were mutually exclusive activities.\r\nOur room on the 15th floor had nice finishes in the bathroom but a badly stained couch. Our niece\'s room which was on a Hilton Honors floor was very dated. The tile grout in the bathroom was awful. I could not have stayed in that room. Even though we are Hilton Honors members, I\'m glad I wasn\'t on that floor.\r\nI know better to stay there on our next trip to New York.'
5,'Tolles Hotel über den Dächern von NY am Times Square','Geniales Hotel, auch wenn ich während eines Blizzards in dem Hotel gestrandet gewesen bin. Das Zimmer war einfach Wahnsinn, das Service trotz des Wetters und der wenigen Angestellten trotzdem wunderbar.\r\nIch kehre definitiv in dieses Hotel ein, wenn ich wieder in NY sein werde.'
5,'Awesome place to stay','This hotel was amazing – My sister and I just really wanted to catch a play and enjoy NYC. We decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza and are so glad we chose this hotel. It is not only right in the middle of Times Square but it is so close to everything that we wanted to do! \r\nWe loved the rooms, great size, clean and spacious for the night. The service was fantastic – We can’t believe how professional all the staff was and how right at home we felt. Special thanks to Caren at the Front Desk for being so accommodating and making our sisters weekend special!'
4,'Buona Scelta','Posizione ottima, camera grande per gli standard di Manhattan e buon servizio'
4,'Nice hotel, convenient location, expensive drinks','Stayed here for 4 nights on a trip for sisters honeymoon, got upgraded room which was good. Room large, bed awesome, our shower was a standard one and a bit weak. Right by Times Square, quite noisy even though we were 15 floors up but to be expected and reminded you that you were in NYC! Concierge unhelpful and 1 gentlemen plain rude. Bar nice but $9 for a bottle of beer. Nice coffee machine in room, recommend perching square by grand central station for breakfast, and Emmett O\'Lunneys for a beer. Tip - if you smile outside hotel don\'t take a pack with you as constantly approached for cigarettes!, just take the one you want and leave rest inside.'
4,'Toplage In New York','Ob man Richtung Süden (Chelsea, Soho, Meatpacking District), Norden (Central Park, Harlem, Bronx) oder nach Westen oder Osten will, die Lage des Hotels im Grand Central mit diversen U-Bahnen ist erstklassig. Das Hotel ist stark von Gruppen und Kongressen frequentiert, deshalb ist es in der Lobby (oder auch am check-in) meist laut und sehr busy! Die Zimmer sind sauber & angenehm groß, die Betten ein Traum, die Bäder klein und etwas veraltet (laute Druckspülung am WC!). Durch dir verspiegelte und dunkel verglaste Fassade ist es im Zimmer ohne Kunstlicht nicht zu machen. Alles in allem stimmt das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis.'
5,'Wonderful stay at Park Central','Great location, helpful staff, clean rooms. Only problem we had was that our request for room with Times Square view was not available, but we could have changed rooms the day after our arrival. Our room was on 19th Floor, with very little street noise and we were very happy with it.\r\nThe staff were very helpful, I was so pleasantly surprised because of reviews we had read before our stay - opting to stay at the hotel because of location, when it turned out to be a wonderful experience all round.\r\nThe Grayline bus also has a stop very near to the hotel.\r\nLoved our time in New York - will stay at Park Central again, and recommend to our friends..'
4,'Clean and quick','Good location, clean and ccomfortable. Check in was immediate (at 11 am) and the staff friendly. Pleanty of coffee shops near by and one block from the subway.'
1,'Pretentious Joke','I have had the good fortune to travel around the world and experience many different types of accommodations. I am very easy to accommodate and realize that running hotels can be a challenge. Overall, I\'m a pretty flexible guy and simply enjoy different hotel experiences.....until now. This hotel is without question the most arrogant and pretentious bait and switch that I have ever experienced. The micro rooms defy explanation. I would just encourage you to read the other descriptions in this section and beware that they are so small you literally cannot take 2 steps in any direction without hitting a wall (I\'m truly not joking). Above all, the service is arrogant, pretentious and borders on offensive with social wannabe\'s in thier 20\'s pretending to be so cool that you and your $300+++ room rate are not worthy of their time. My associates all agreed that this was truly the worst we had experienced in our many years of combined travel. By the way, we tried to give the hotel feedback on their site, but the contact us page does not work. How ironic and true to the entire experience. Beware and stay away from this joke of a hotel.'
4,'Great location and will definately return','We have just returned home from a great holiday in New York. From the minute we checked in the staff were all friendly and very helpful. Our room was on the 37th floor and would ask for it again, the view was amazing especially at night when the Empire State was lit! We had a quad room for three of us and was quite spacious. The bathroom was a little dated but very functionable, the shower was very powerful. We were within walking distance to practically everything, Macys was just around the corner! the only niggle i have is that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. although starbucks was just across the road. I would definately return.'
3,'Un po\' delusa...','Forse sarò stata sfortunata in questo caso, ma a parte la posizione ottima per chi si deve muovera a piedi (due passi da Central Park, due passi da Time Square ecc.) tutto il resto mi ha un po\' delusa. Camera piccola, e vista sull\'interno della struttura, nonostante avessimo chiesto specificatamente altro. Personale scortese e poco disponibile ad aiutarci, colazione non inclusa, nonostante l\'avessimo richiesta tramite la nostra agenzia. Rapporto qualità/prezzo a mio avviso non soddisfacente! Spero sia stato solo una caso di coincidenze poco fortuite, certo non è stato il massimo per la mia prima volta a New York.'
3,'A bit lost in a great location','I spent 4 days in NYC for New Year\'s and booked this hotel at the very last minute through Priceline, for about €230 a night. \r\nI had a quick read through Tripadvisor before setting off, and this is probably the most accurately commented hotel of any of those I\'ve stayed in.\r\nThe location of the hotel is excellent, more or less on Central Park, and only 100m from the Columbus Circle subway, which is on the vital red line. You\'re never far from anything when staying here.\r\nAnd the unusual style of the hotel is quite nice too. The lobby is very impressive, and the low-lighting throughout does add a certain ambience that you don\'t normally get in hotels. It does feel like you\'re in a member\'s club rather than a hotel. Heating was at full tilt, and seeing as we were in minus temperatures outside, it was always nice to step inside.\r\nCheck in was very straightforward. \r\nThe rooms are tiny. If anything over the bare minimum required by a traveller is provided, we\'re talking about in inches rather than feet. Don\'t let this put you off though - apart from the lack of a bath, there isn\'t anything you can\'t do in one of these rooms that you might do in a suite. \r\nSo all in all, that\'s quite good so far, and given the price for the time of year, I really wouldn\'t complain.\r\nInstead, I\'d recommend. \r\nPeople staying in the hotel over the week seemed almost all to fall in the economy to mid-range traveller brackets. And I\'d imagine that most of these folks took one look at the price list and never spent a single cent on the premises. \r\nI risked a bottle of beer one evening and got stung for $9. Which, like everything in the hotel, just isn\'t worth it.\r\nAnd due to the way the hotel is arranged, it is possible to enter and exit your room without crossing the lobby or encountering a member of staff. \r\nSo with residents not spending any money, and residents not meeting or even visiting the communal areas, there is no hotel experience here for most guests. It\'s just a well-positioned, small room in New York.\r\nWhy a hotel would take this strategy is beyond me. There is a potential four-figure audience for facilities staying each night, but they\'re all down the road in Starbucks, or another eatery.\r\nThe premium they\'re earning on each item is surely dwarfed by the earnings they\'re losing by outpricing their core audience.'
4,'Decent Hotel, but Extra for Gym was NOT worth it','I\'ve stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in the Loop several times, for business and just for weekend getaways. It\'s in a convenient location for the Art Inst. & concerts in Millenium Park. Plus, I find the beds comfy, I like the lobby, and it\'s usually very clean. I never pay more than $100/night on hotwire for this hotel (even in July). There is such as wide range of room types in this large hotel; my secret for getting a good-sized room is to ask for 2 beds. Twice at check-in I asked for a room with 2 baths (great if you\'re traveling with a family) - once they didn\'t charge me extra, and once they did, $19. \r\nAfter reading on TA that the gym was great, I paid $10 this past weekend to use it. It\'s an okay space, but not great. Equipment was standard and mostly in good working order. But there is only room for one person at a time to do floor/core exercises on a mat. It was FREEZINGLY air-conditioned - to the point where as I started working up a sweat, my glasses fogged up! People were wearing the little towels as sweaters! Also, really too loud pop music piped in - I asked attendant to turn it down, but she didn\'t. And there was no view at all. The Conrad Hotel does have a super-gorgeous workout facility with amazing views of the lake, and they don\'t charge extra for it (but of course the Conrad comes at luxury prices too). But I wouldn\'t pay extra for the gym at the Palmer House again.'
5,'Loved the Affinia New York','We have just returned from New York and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan hotel. As the trip was a birthday suprise the hotel was chosen on my behalf, but I couldn\'t have done a better job myself. As our cab dropped us off outside I was instantly impressed with the location on 7th ave opposite Madison Sq Gardens and just down the road from Times Sq, and the Empire State Building and really close to a number of subway stations to enable you to get around. Upon arrival the helpful and very friendly staff helped us with our bags in to the gorgeous Art Deco reception to check in. As it was my first time in New York we wanted a good view from our room and asked the receptionist, he then instantly upgraded us to a one bedroon suite on the 25th floor for no extra charge. When we arrived in our room we found it clean and tidy and was very spacious with a separate livingroom and a kitchen area equiped with cooker and fridge freezer with ice. The bed was nice and comfy and there was a pillow menu so you could choose the type of pillow you liked best. The bathroom was equiped with shower and bath. But best of all was the view from the suites four windows, as we were overlooking the empire state building and midtown manhattan and could see all the way to the east river accross the far side of town. Overall I loved New York and was very impressed with the Affinia Manhattan and will deffinately stay here again. The convinient location, the lovely room and the excellent friendly staff helped in making a great trip to New York.'
4,'Average expected more to be honest','In a city where space comes at a premium the rooms are very well sized.\r\nIts clean, and just like a hilton. But thats it really. Theres nothing special about the hotel other than the fact its REALLY HIGH UP. \r\nI suppose no one goes to NYC to stay in the hotel'
5,'Huge room!!! Great location!!!','Stayed her for 3 days over labor day weekend. Room was biggest I\'d ever stayed in, in NYC. Staff was so friendly. Airline screwed up flight home and we decided to stay another night, they honored price we found online. Will stay here next trip to the big apple if at all possible!'
4,'Felt like I was on my honeymoon all over again!','Let\'s see, the check-in process was great! We were upgraded from a double to a King size room on the fifteenth floor, free of charge. How about for an anniversary present! The hotel is beautiful and very romantic. As others have stated, the bathrooms are less than roomy. The location is perfect, because it is centrally located by everything. My stay was during the July 4th weekend, therefore the hotel was busy. In all honesty, the staff were great and extremely friendly. We plan on returning next year for the Taste of Chicago again! Just a friendly hint, the rooms are small unless you request a queen or king size bed.'
1,'A palace price for a motel service, message sent to the hotel.','To whom it may concern,\r\nFor your information we would like to thank you for the worst stay we never had in North America for years. We are totally unhappy with our stay in your hotel for the following reasons.\r\n- Queeing for every single request, for an approximative answer, most of the time, it\'s not me but the other desk or person The most wellknown word in your hotel : Sorry Sir ! Cann\'t help it.\r\n- Arriving at 1pm, we were told we were pre-checked and have to come bac after 4pm for comple check-in at 4pm. The luggage were store at $1.50 each but paid $3.75 each.\r\n- 1st time we opened the bedroom‘s door : it smelled like something\'s is rottening in.\r\n- The safe was out of order.\r\n- The bedsheets looked clean but stained on several places in both beds.\r\n- The bedroom was as damp as a swamp, after 3 weeks in Florida we clearly can identify what means « damp ».\r\n- The AC didn\'t blow cool and dry air, but a very luke warm and damp one. I opened the top and saw that some water’s leaking from the tap and corroding the pipes. At home all of our belongings were damp and smelling rotten. My wife spent her weekend washing and ironing.\r\n- Towels : 3 for 4 every single day, after requesting an extra one to your agent, Sorry Sir...I\'ll report it and send you one! Never received and nothing improved.\r\nAfter having noticed these failures we asked and requested to your front desk agent another bedroom, the answer was exactly what we expected from : You just paid for a superior room located between the 3rd and 17th floor. We won\'t do nothing because the hotel is sold out. If you want a different room at a higher floor, the only difference is the coffee machine and the rate.\r\n- About the Internet access at $ 14.20 which is a real shop lifting. I subscribe to 2 days + 1 day = $ 42.60, final invoice $ 96.-.\r\n A $ 54... connection was added to it. We\'ve got one pc and nothing else. After arguiing and showing our good faith your agent accepted to reduce the bill of $ 28.40 and keeping the other figures in, what a thieve ! We finally paid for what we used, 3 days. Tourists are just suckers !!! « Sorry Sir, New-York City is very expensive ! »\r\n - But least but not last on wednesday my wife and my daughter were having itchings in their head that were checked in the first coming pharmacy-> HOUSE LICE. Without adding any bed bugs.\r\nWe were suprised to see that inflatable rat in front of the hotel every single day of our stay informing us and your guests about bed bugs infections in your place. After chatting with the person in charge of the inflated rat, we were informed about house lice, stange for an establishment of your quality, sold in Europ as a 4*.'
2,'Better than expected','This hotel would not be my first choice but I did not find it to be as bad as many previous reviewers. My room, 965, was small but it was not disgusting in any way. It was clean. The king size mattress seemed fairly new and was comfortable. The curtains on window were new looking and also clean. The bathroom was clean, no mold, with a clean shower curtain and plenty of towels. I was curious about the history of the hotel and how it ended up in its current condition. It was the world\'s largest hotel when it opened in 1919 and the first to have a bathroom in every room. Built by a man named Statler but his chain was purchased by Hilton so this was the Statler Hilton at one time. The current owner(s) purchased it to demolish it and build an office tower. Historical groups have tried to block this unsuccessfully. The latest plan(fall 2011) from the current owner is to refurbish the hotel due to the current economic conditions not making an office tower feasible.\r\nThe location is wonderful. It is probably the lowest priced hotel in the area. I found the check in staff and housekeeping staff efficient and friendly. If I couldn\'t find something else affordable in the area I would consider staying again.'
3,'Bien ordinaire','Très très ordinaire sauf l\'emplacement (Près de l\'Empire State Building, Macy\'s et Madison Garden et à 15 minutes à pied de Times Square). Cahmbre de bain minuscule et vieillotte, (Même pas de place pour mettre ses produits), chambre petite. Service à l\'arrivée exécrable et personnes n\'a pu trouver des coupes à nous passer (vin champagne etc.) à la limite des verres en verre...non juste en plastique. En tout cas, nous avions demander un frigo qu\'il a fallu redemander, pas de cafetière, et malgré la demande d\'une chambre avec vue...chambre avec vue sur le mur de briques d\'à côté. Nous avions également demnader 2 chambres près l\'une de l\'autre et nous avons étét localisés sur 2 étages différents. Très ordinaire pour le prix.'
5,'Excellent Value For Money','Ignore all the poor reviews on this hotel. We had a double double room which was clean and spacious for 4 adults. The foyer of the hotel is lovely. We found the staff helpful throughout our stay. The gym was a good size and well equipped compared to other hotels previously stayed in. The main selling point to the hotel is of course the location. It couldnt\' be better if you tried. Just a couple of minutes walk to Central Park and a short walk to Times Square with the entrance to the tube next to the hotel.Would definitely recommend this hotel for a leisure stay!!'
4,'Nice location, not bad for NYC.','Nice location. Very central. Easy to get anywhere. Room was nice size and in decent shape. Huge hotel and a bit pricey but hey its NYC. would consider again but may do better at a boutique hotel for the $. Overall clean, nice staff and easy stay. \r\nWould do it again.'
5,fantastique,'j\'ai séjourné avec ma fille de 15 ans 5 nuits dans cet hôtel conseillé par mon agence.\r\nnous avons été ravies par cet hôtel,la chambre avec 2 lits king size alors qu\'on avait payé pour 1 lit double,la wifi nous a été offerte à l’arrivée mais étant donné ce qu\'on avait lu sur votre site nous n\'avions pas pris d\'ordinateur! très grande chambre au décor moderne,dressing avec table et fer à repasser,propreté impeccable,serviettes à volonté changées tous les jours,calme malgré un emplacement exceptionnel,nous avons pu tout visiter à pieds:ONU,TIMES SQUARE,EMPIRE STATE,et même Central Park,\r\nJe vous le recommande vivement.'
5,'In the Heart of Time Square --- Perfect location !','Yes, we were right in the heart of busy Time Square. It was easy to walk to various sights & to take the Hop on Hop Off Bus that was available at the corner of our hotel. There were several theatres next door & near by this hotel.\r\nThe Marriott itself was beautiful & clean. The helpful staff made our 3 night stay very enjoyable. As suggested by others on this Tripadvisor site, we ask for an upper floor room overlooking Time Square. It was quiet & large. I have to sing the praises of this Marriott --- we could not have had a better stay !'
2,'Very noisy and no hot water','Very noisy, major construction going on at MSG kept us awake most of the night. No hot water for all evening, they gave us a breakfast voucher to make up for it, but the breakfast at Tic Toc Diner was bad - half done French Toast and weak coffee. Lots of bums in the area I guess because of the train station. Very small room, fine for 1 person but too small for a couple. Not recommended.'
4,'First trip to New York','My daughter and I decided on a mother-daughter trip to New York and because I have Mariott honored guest points, we decided to stay at the Marriott Marquis on Time Square. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. For the price we were paying, I expected the hotel to be a bit more classy. The room we were in needed remodeling. The beds were comfy and the location was great. The hotel room itself was just OK. If you are first timer to New York, I would suggest you take the double decker bus around Manhattan to get familiar with the city. Also don\'t miss Chinatown and the designer purses that are behind closed doors. Also take the Staten Island Ferry (its free) to see a beautiful skyline. The half price tickets for broadway show is located in this hotel, lines start forming about 1.5 hours before the ticket offices opens.'
4,Comfortable,'The Affinia Manhattan is more like an apartment rather than a hotel. You just get that homely feeling as soon as you walk into the lobby.\r\nThe hotel is in a very good location at the south end of midtown & right across the road from Madison Square Garden & Penn station.\r\nThe room we stayed in was very clean & had a small kitchen which came in very handy. The room was very comfortable & there was a pretty good restuarant & bar downstairs next to the lobby.\r\nJust like most hotels in NYC, it is a bit pricey for what you are getting.'
3,Average,'The New Yorker hotel was ideally located on 6th avenue & easy to find from the airport. Staff were helpful & room service were efficient. I did find the room to be a lot smaller then the photo indicated & the bathroom very dated. Water pressure was average. I also suffered from an ongoing rash due to the detergent used on the bed sheets. For NY Accomdation prices, you got exacty what you paid for.'
5,'Hotel Staff','I would simply like to say a big thank you on behalf of my wife and I to the staff at Crowne Plaza for making our first visit to America so very welcoming.\r\nServers Keon and Richie were so friendly and Keon who served us when we arrived so very tired from Los Angeles was so understanding and helpful that he deserves a special mention.\r\nI have to mention the beautiful ladies in the lobby namely Michelle, Miliha, Edith and Brunilda who with their combined efficiency and good humour made for a very pleasant stay.\r\nOur sincere thanks to everyone.\r\nBest wishes\r\nDavid Newman'
4,'Perfekte Lage','Das New Yorker Hotel liegt in Midtown Manhattan, gar nicht weit von Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue und zahlreichen Broadway Theater. Times Square ist auch nur ca. 8 blocks entfernt. Also, man kann von diesem Hotel aus einiges zu Fuss erreichen, sehr praktisch. In der Naehe vom New Yorker gibt es sehr viele Cafes und Restaurants. Ich wuerde emphehlen auf der 9 Avenue ein Cafe zu suchen, da gibt\'s weniger Touristen und ist auch noch guenstiger. Also, man kann von diesem Hotel aus einiges zu Fuss erreichen, sehr praktisch. Das Hotel an sich ist gut. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, die Zimmer gepflegt, aber etwas klein. Wir hatten auch eine gute Aussicht von unserem Zimmer. Ich wuerde dieses Hotel auf jeden Fall empfehlen!'
3,'la mejor ubicación en Manhattan con lo peor de la cadena Hilton.','sin duda la mejor ubicación en Manhattan: a una cuadra de la 5ta av., a 5 de times square, a menos de 10 cuadras de Central Park y con un Deli espectacular a 2 cuadras para comer bien y barato.\r\nhabitaciones: por ser NY mas que correctas en su amplitud, aunque muy limitada la reposición de los artículos para el baño, como así también casi nulo el aseo de las mismas.\r\nMala predispocisión del servicio de concierge y ni que hablar lo insoportable que se torna que cada vez que pasas por el lobby te quieran vender el club hilton!!!!\r\notro tema son los ascensores ya que al haber múltiples eventos se tornan casi inaccesibles.\r\nNo obstante, si como yo van con niños pequeños, es una buena opción dado su ubicación.'
2,'Over-rated, over-priced and under-sized','The location may be good but that\'s about it. What a pretentious over-hyped ripoff. This place might seem appealing to someone who\'s used to sleeping in closets. For $ 350.00 PLUS we had a room with no view that might have been 160 sq. ft. if that. No coffee maker. A glass wall on the shower so you could see through to someone on the toilet from the bed? What the heck is that all about? I\'ve been in airplane bathrooms that were bigger and the glass wall was creepy.. \r\nWhen I asked the too cute and too smarmy clerk at the front desk if we could change rooms, she told me that I was \'registered for a queen standard and that\'s what I was given\' and \'if I\'d like to explore upgrade options, blah blah blah...\'. The hotel temperature was in the mid 70\'s. Same in the room. Set the A/C unit a little lower in the room? It goes on and off every five minutes, and the A/C unit is located directly behind the headboard! It\'s just nuts...\r\nSkip this joint completely unless your some desperate foreign traveller with no other options and no regard for comfort and value.'
1,'This Hotel is a Dump','Please go somewhere else the rooms are the worse i have ever seen.'
3,'Good location','we stayed in the new yorker hotel june 2012. when we checked in, there was no great welcome for us from the staff. our room was on the 24th floor with no view- disapointing ! interior of hotel and rooms nice and location was great! the diner located inside the hotel called the \'tick tock\', even if you are starving, i\'d advise you to stay away. the bathrooms in the diner were filthy and the food was awful.'
5,'In the adversity of Superstorm Sandy -- Westin brightly shined','We checked in the Friday before Superstorm Sandy hit NY. The location is ideal for the numerous Theaters around Times Square. We spent Saturday and Sunday shopping and walking around Central Park which is a quick subway ride from the Westin\'s lobby door. \r\nThen Sandy roared in on Monday. Our kudos and accolades to the Westin management and staff for keeping guests informed and safe. We received daily written updates from the GM under our room door on what to expect the next day. Fortunately, the hotel did not lose power and was not damaged. It served breakfast in the ballrooms and accommodated overflow guests from other hotels that needed to be evacuated. We could not leave NYC for several days after our original departure date and we appreciated the flexibility that we were given.'
4,'In the Middle','This hotel is in the MIDDLE of everything. If you want to stay in Times Square, this is your hotel. I stayed here with my husband while he was here on business as this was the hotel they picked. However, we moved as soon as the business portion was over. We love the various sections of NYC and Times Square is overwhelmingly busy. The room we stayed in was $800/night. Sure it had a great view, sure it was a nice room but never would it be worth that. The hotel is an older building as far as I could tell but once inside you would never have guessed. Everyone we had contact with were very helpful and nice. My husband had a meeting on the day of check out and we were easily granted late checkout. We had an event at the Intrepid and it is an easy walk, especially through Hell\'s Kitchen which has incredible places to eat. Would I stay here again? Only on business and someone else\'s dime.'
5,'Vista mozzafiato su Time Square','Il Crowne Plaza è un Hotel di lusso, stanze spaziose letti king size (molto comodi).\r\nAbbiamo alloggiato a Marzo 2012, camera al 24mo piano con vista su Time Square e devo dire che di notte specialmente è un gran colpo d\'occhio.\r\nInutile dire che l\'hotel si trova nel cuore di NY.\r\nPreso una stanza a prezzo veramente conveniente, consigliatissimo per chi vuole vivere New York di notte.\r\nColazione non compresa nel prezzo ma di ottima qualità, caffè espresso molto simile a quello italiano.'
4,'Good for a short stay','It\'s not what i expected, if you aré going for a short trip is good, 2 or 3 nights, nice personal'
4,'Excellent Staff Care','Despite our travel agent arranging a 6 night booking for May 2012 at the Millennium Broadway New York Hotel in mid November, and paying for it in full in February, this incompetent hotel still managed to double book our room, and on arrival and without any prior notice, we were sent off to the Park Central with a letter telling the Park Central to send them a bill for our accommodation.. Obviously disappointed, confused as to why this had happened, a little angry, and very tired after our flight from UK, Ellen on the Reception desk took control. She was welcoming, efficient, friendly, calming and totally understanding of our predicament, and found us a room. The only available room was disappointing being on a low floor at the end of a long corridor and dark and noisy, so Ellen said she\'d do everything possible to improve the situation. True to her word, the next day we ended up in a much better room on 23rd floor which was perfect for our first New York break. During our stay, Ellen made sure everything was OK for us, and telephoned our room on our departure day to wish us well. She undoubtedly rescued our holiday after the mix up and disappointment at Millennium Broadway. \r\nAs far as the hotel generally was concerned, all the staff we had dealings with were exceptionally friendly, the room was quite small but clean and had everything we needed, with a very comfortable bed, and was serviced regularly and thoroughly. The concierge desk was particularly knowledgeable, informative, patient and helpful. Foodwise, we used only the small breakfast bar, which was quite adequate for us and reasonably priced, and we did have one very enjoyable evening in the bar.\r\nWith the dreadful treatment offered by the Millennium Broadway, whose staff just wanted to get us off the premises, the staff at Park Central were a complete contrast - especially Ellen - being friendly and welcoming at all times. We enjoyed our stay there very much and would definitely return.'
2,'The horror... the horror....','There are only two ways I would ever stay in this hotel again: it\'s gutted to the studs and thoroughly renovated, or it\'s demolished and rebuilt. The only thing stopping me from rating this hotel one star is its fantastic location in midtown Manhattan, right across from Penn Station and within walking distance of Times Square and the Empire State Building. I must also admit that there were no bedbugs, the elevators were fast, and I liked the lobby coffee shop. On the other hand, my room was tiny, dirty, and dim. I could barely fit in the shower stall (and I weigh ~160 pounds). My view was of someone else\'s window. It was a relief to leave.'
5,'Plein centre de manhattan','Hotel très bien situé en plein centre de Manhattan, sur Broadway . Nous y avons passé 7 nuits avec nos trois enfants. Seul problème à notre arrivée : il a fallu négocier 10 minutes pour avoir 2 chambres au même étage, alors que la demande avait été faite lors de notre réservation 4 mois plus tôt. Les chambres sont spacieuses, les salles de bains aussi (comparativement à nos 2 précédents séjours dans d\'autres hôtels). Elles sont bien équipées (coffre fort, table à repasser et fer, machine à café, tout les produits nécessaires dans la salle de bains.) Nous avions une chambre d\'angle, avec de grandes baies vitrées, un lit king size (literie très confortable) Nos enfants avaient une chambre à 2 lits (un peu juste cependant pour les 2 enfants dormant dans le même lit car 120 de large). Elles sont bien insonnorisées (aucun bruit, alors que notre chambre donnait sur broadway et que nous n\'étions qu\'au 21ème étage). Le personnel est très aimable, que ce soit à la réception, au restaurant ou au bar. Les femmes de chambres sont très discrètes mais efficaces. Le petit déjeuner buffet est excellent ( mention spéciale pour le jus d\'orange) Il est cher, mais il est très copieux. Ce qui nous permettait de ne pas nous arréter le midi pour manger. Il est possible de manger tard au bar, ce qui est très pratique après le spectacle. Le métro est pratiquement au pied de l hôtel, mais on peut faire énormément de choses à pied compte tenu de sa situation très centrale. Même si tout n\'est pas parfait (wifi payante, pas de frigo dans la chambre, pas de peignoir ni de chaussons), je recommande sans hésitation cet hôtel.'
3,'great location','this hotel is all about location. It\'s a short walk to many theaters, restaurants, and is right in Times Square. Good location for family with teens. The room is plain, but comfortable. Plumbing in bathroom is showing its age.'
4,'LOVED IT','stayed here on a booking off of expedia for Thanksgiving, loved the view (17th floor) of times square. place was really clean, staff very friendly and knowledgable-will go out of the way to help you, rooms clean and beds comfortabe, and location was great, 1/2 block from times square. will stay there again next year over new years eve. only negative thing was their restaraunt downstairs was really high on price, small portions but was good eating. overall great place and highly recommend it'
5,'Great location, beautiful renovated rooms','This hotel is right in the heart of Time Square, a perfect location for site-seeing and the theater, and has excellent subway access and service. They have recently renovated many of the rooms. The rooms are fairly large and bright, with great views of Times Square.\r\nThe 24 hour fitness center is large and well equipped, with many new machines.'
2,'Cost of telephone call,receipt of parcel and mold','I stayed in the Westin hotel for 5 days during October The hotel is in a good location and the staff are excellent \r\nThe stay was marred by the following event\r\nI made a telephone call from my room to a company 180 miles away ,the call lasted about 5 minutes I was charged $19.65 for the call compare this too.\r\nThe cost of charged by the company to send the parcel 180 miles to me weighing 4 Lbs by overnight carrier was $16\r\nAdditionally the hotel were going to charge $5 to receive the parcel \r\nOther There was as other people have commented evidence of mold around the bath and the grouting has been painted black which does not inspire\r\nIn summery the hotel has the potential to be a good base but is marred by examples above'
5,'A Guest Since 1985','My last visit to The Edison was in Dec - Jan of 07-08. I always travel right after Christmas through New Years. My visits are always enjoyable and the rooms are always very suitable. I began staying at The Edison in 1985, escorting High School student Theatre Trips. I now am a school principal and travel alone and frequently. The hotel staff is and has always been very nice, polite, and helpful. Yes, the location is great, but there is something even greater about staying in a historic building, a part of old New York. I have stayed at the Marriott, The Millenium, The Four Seasons, and others. For the dollar, The Edison is real value. I visit to be in the city, to see the city, and to be part of New York. Staying at THe Edison is just part of being in New York. Even though I have stayed in other hotels, I choose The Edison. It is comfortable, it is familiar, and it grounds me.\r\nRussell Johnson'
5,'Great location and room','Stayed here for a long weekend in June. The location is in the middle of everything that is going on in Times Square and our 2 theatres were both within walking distance. The staff was very friendly and quick to serve. The room size was great and the beds terrific. Noise from the outside was almost nonexistent in our 36th floor room. A must is the View restaurant/lounge on the 48th floor. Some hints to people in a hurry: elevators can take up to 10 minutes to catch during busy times and the cab stand can be crowded also. Just allow enough time or simply walk out on to Broadway to catch a cab.'
3,'fancy but very small rooms','Was looking to stay at this hotel for a few nights as my cousin was getting married and having his functions at this same hotel. The room itself is fancy if not very tiny even for NYC, i suppose i would recommend this property for anyone that was looking for someplace hip and convenient to central park. It is relatively pricey even when using priceline, though perhaps not since this is NYC during a busy month. The atmosphere is chic and the place was clean and adequately furnished.'
3,'Excellent location','i agree that the rooms are old, but i had no problem during my stay.\r\nThis hotel has a excellent location. In front of Penn Station and Madson Square garden. There was a good shower, bathtub and was so quiet to sleep. It\'s not the best place, but for me was what i needed.'
2,'Waste of money!','Service/staff was terrible. Least helpful staff possible. Conceirge was gone early in the night. No one could help with dinner suggestions. The only suggestion was to use a computer by the front desk.\r\nOur room was DISGUSTING!! Small, humid, a/c wasn\'t working, bathroom had mold on tile and shower curtain. Smelled moldy. The bathroom had hair all over the floor, toilet and shower. Two of the three lights in the room were broken. The ONLY good thing about this hotel was the location. \r\nWe had to argue for over a half hour about getting a new room. After the typical excuses, like no rooms available, we put up enough fuss to get a new room (front desk lady said she had to steal it from someone else and that she would be in trouble- so if we were fine with that we could have the room)\r\nI would never come back or recommend this place. Horrible.'
3,'Great Location, Average Hotel','I have walked by this hotel during many visits to NYC and when my husband had to attend a work meeting in the area, we decided to give this place a try, since a government rate was available during our stay. You cannot beat the location, especially if you are in NYC to see some shows. You can easily walk to Broadway theaters and many restaurants. \r\nAs Platinum Rewards Members, we had free wi-fi, which usually worked okay (but slowly) during the day, but was iffy in the evening hours with problems connecting. I would not have been happy if we had to pay for this. I don\'t think there is any excuse these days for a big hotel chain like Marriott to have so many internet problems in so many of their hotels. We also had access to the Concierge Lounge, which was an absolute zoo during breakfast and evening snack hours. It would be nice if this hotel set up a separate lounge for Gold/Platinum members. No free alcohol either; even the wine was $10 a glass! I would not be paying extra for a room with access to the Concierge Lounge.\r\nOur room was fine, large with a nice view of Times Square. We did not get an upgrade. We did not hear any street noise in our room. We had a car and parking was $55.00 a day. The gym was one of the largest I have seen in a Marriott with a lot of treadmills and elliptical machines. My husband used it several times and was very impressed. I had to use the business center to make some copies and send a FAX and the woman working in the morning was extremely helpful and friendly, even though the room was full of people asking her for help. When I came back in the afternoon to send another FAX, the two women working had just the opposite attitude.\r\nI don\'t understand the complaints about the elevators. The system works well and avoids long waits and huge mobs trying to cram into one small elevator.\r\nIf I got a good price, I would probably stay at this location again.'
1,'Hotel limite !!','Nous avons séjournés 8 jours dans cet hôtel et l\'unique point positif est sa situation géographique...Pour le reste, il ne faut s\'attendre à rien de très sérieux... le rapport qualité- prix ( certes pas très cher ) ne mérite pas une telle prestation pour le prix proposé.\r\nEn effet, je ne suis pas très difficile envers mon épouse , en ce qui concerne les hôtels au confort  restreint...mais là, c\'était un peu abusé tout de même....\r\nL\'hotel dispose, je pense, de certaines chambres rénovées, et l\'attribution de ces dernières se fait  à la roulette russe...Ceux qui ont un peu de chance laissent , à mon avis, un avis positif sur les sites tel que tripadvisor....ou autres...\r\nCar, il faut bien l\'avouer, j\'ai fait comme tout le monde....ma décision de prendre cet hôtel pour notre semaine à New York a été fondée sur quelques avis positifs dans l\'ensemble...et je me disais...oui ne sois pas trop difficile...c\'est juste pour dormir...un hôtel reste un hôtel...car la plupart des autres hôtels sont moins bien situés...alors ...on verra....\r\nEh bien , certes nous avons tout de même passé un agréable séjour, mais il faut quand meme bien dire que dans la chambre, c\'était très humide ( surtout la moquette) , climatisation insalubre avec moisissures et rouille, poils dans les draps lorsqu\'on est arrivé, salle de bain spartiate mais à peu prés fonctionnelle ....Bref nous n\'avons rien dit à la réception car je me suis dit que cela ne servirai à rien....je savais que je laisserai un avis pour les prochain touristes....\r\nEn résumé, pour le même prix, dans le même secteur, on peut trouver beaucoup plus propre et plus sérieux....je vous aurai prévenu...'
5,'Great Hotel.','Stayed here 2/10 til 5/10.My girfriend and I. Bedroom was very large, Bed was huge and very comfortable. Yes the bathroom is small but living in London it was no surpise. Full kitchen with large oven and micowave)not theat we used it)\r\nRoom was on the 25th floor, still a lot of road noise tho, had a great views from all windows, 5 minute walk to macys, Deli next door and Bar across the road.\r\nRestaurant wasnt busy when we went, very good service and great food for the price.\r\nWould stay there again.'
4,'excellente situation','très bien situé, à quelques mètres de Times square, à deux pas d\'un métro, Central park en 10/15 minutes à pied.... \r\nles chambres sont confortables, bonne literie. Chambre avec vue sur l\'hudson. En revanche, c\'est relativement bruyant. Le fait d\'être en pleine ville d\'abord, NY oblige, puis système de ventilation bruyant malgré l\'arrêt de la clim. L\'isolation avec les autres chambres et le couloir pas top non plus. Bref, il faut prévoir les boules quies. Salle de bains très correcte (avec baignoire), accessoires de toilette fournis mais pas de kit de couture par exemple (même en demandant à la réception !). Petit déjeuner très cher et pas top quand pas compris.'
3,'Lacks attention to detail.','We stayed two nights after getting a decent rate from Priceline. Good points: The lobby is spectacular; the (replacement) room was nicely appointed; the bed was singularly fantastic. Not-so-good points: No obvious place to stop at the main entrance; outrageous parking charges (self-park $36/day; valet $51/day); lousy hotel access from self-park; overcharging our account (which was corrected); unknowledgeable valet and door people. Our first room had a strong musty smell with a deodorizer/chemical finish, so we called guest services immediately for a room change, which took an inordinately long time. Returning from self-park after 10:00 p.m., the valet entrance was locked and we had to walk around the corner to the main entry in the rain. We avoided the concierge, as there was only one person and never less than three people waiting for his time. We wouldn\'t stay again, as too many little oversights affected us negatively. Insufficient consideration for the purported quality of hotel.'
5,'Can\'t go wrong staying at Hilton!','The best thing of staying at Hilton starts with the reservation process: Quick and easy.\r\nI opted for a pre-paid deal with no refunds.\r\nCheck-in took less than 2 minutes.\r\nRoom at 14th floor with a nice view and nice furniture. Coffee maker was not working but as soon as I let them know it was promptly changed.\r\nI give a 10 + for this hotel, not only because of comfort and great staff but also because the location can\'t be better (walking distance after a Broadway show and to plenty of restaurants and bars).\r\nI have been to this hotel many times and I can\'t imagine myself in NYC without staying at Hilton. \r\nToiletries are of good brands. I would suggest Hilton provide cotton swabs as well (as almost all good hotels do). A plastic envelope containing 4 cotton swabs daily would be good (this is only a suggestion to improve comfort).'
5,'Exceeded our expectations!','We booked this hotel last Thanksgiving after seeing the parade on TV. Luckily my husband and I had accumulated Starwood points and had plenty to cover a 5 night stay. \r\nI had read previous reports stating front desk staff was rude, but we did not encounter that at all. At check-in we were upgraded to a higher floor for Starwood members which gave us a higher floor with free internet access. I was thrilled with the free internet! We had room 3733 looking down on Times Square and we could see the top on the Empire State Building. Wonderful view. Better yet, we had no idea until days later, the day of the Macys parade, that we could see the parade with a great vew, from our room!!! We felt so fortunate. \r\nThe maid service came every day while we were out sightseeing and visiting family. We never saw them but they did a great job. We were very happy with our room, it had plenty of space for us and our small children, ages 5 & 7. The only downside was the douible bed, queen would have been better but its a very minor complaint. Be careful with the wet bar. Our kids were enthralled with the $5 candy bars and took them out a few times to beg us for them. They were on a sensor so we almost were charged for $30 of candy. My husband called the front desk and they gave us no trouble and removed the charges. Thumbs up!\r\nThe hotel is really more of a place to sleep and shower, maybe have some downtime. Its not resort like with lots of areas to hang out. But thats NYC. \r\nWe did go to the GOURMET NEW YORK place accross the street 2 times for breakfast, which was great but the coffee was not! Skip the coffee and go next door to Starbucks. The california omelette was yummy. We had lunch our last day at Schnippers Quality Kitchen about 2 blocks over and it was fantastic. Its family owned and operated, not a chain. Great burgers and hot dogs! They had sandwiches too. Loved it. \r\nOne last thing, the Westin website stated they gave little gifts to the kids at check -in. They had run out so they offered to send up free cookies and milk for the kids one night. We really liked that little touch.\r\nWe will definitely stay at this hotel again, and would recommend to anyone.'
4,'Wonderful,Lively & Vibrant Location.','Though the hotel was a 30 mins drive from JFK,the location was as lively & Vibrant as I had heard of.Times square,TKTS,The theatre district,Rockfellers,5th Av....& much more was all so accesible from the hotel.The rooms though small were done up nicely.The room service was good.It was a overall a good stay...I would stay there again.'
3,'Antiguo, pero buena ubicacion','Lo mejor del hotel es la ubicacion, esta a pocas cuadras de times square, se puede llegar caminando.\r\nEsta en el medio de todo, para ir hacia el sur, como para ir hacia el norte.\r\nEl hotel en si no es lujoso, es mas bien antiguo. En mi baño habia pintura del techo descascarada. Pero por el precio que estan los hoteles en ny esta muy bien. No tiene desayuno, ni tiene wifi gratuito. \r\nEs un hotel solo para dormir, no tiene nada para disfrutar.'
3,'small rooms, great location','The reviews of Hudson Hotel you find on Tripavisor are basically correct: rooms are small, hotel design is not such a big thing, good location (expecially if you ride the Subway) is absolutely the plus.\r\nMy wife and I needed a clean double room and Hudson satisfied our request. We hoped the rooms were bigger than it seemed from the user pictures... and they were not! (actually New York hotel rooms aren\'t quite large, Hudson was in average, after all).\r\nThe hotel designer is Philip Starck and his best things are the bar and the lobby (not the rooms). If you like Gossip Girl you\'ll be happy to know that a few scenes were shot at Hudson. Is that enough for their room price? You decide.\r\nThe staff. They were kind, but somehow they lost our luggage after the check out: we spent 1/2 hour waiting for them to find it. But I still believe it was just a mistake, and mistakes happen. So, don\'t worry too much about the staff.\r\nThree years ago I spent my New York days at the Fitzpatricks (on Lexington): it was a smaller hotel, less glossy, and with larger rooms... I liked it more.'
3,'Edison Hotel a Solid Choice for NYC!','Four of us stayed five nights at the Edison, in room 1100 and 1110. Overall it was an excellent value for NYC. Pros: 1) location-1/2 block from Times Square, easy access to the subway (especially the A line to JFK), tour buses, Central Park; 2) room was comfortable (not beautiful, but comfy) and clean; 3) service was friendly and excellent; 4) easy check in/out. Cons: 1) furniture is tacky and need replacement. All in all, it was a great choice and value. Food recommendations: breakfast at PAX on 7th Avenue (1/2 block north of Times Square) for great prices on homemade food; and the wonderful restaurants on 9th Avenue (two blocks west of the hotel), including The Hummus Kitchen, Mee Chinese, and Terraza Toscana. All had delicious food, good prices and great service.'
3,'Convenient and good price','I agree with most of the other reviewers. This hotel is old so rooms are very small, and bathrooms are small with no counter space. I don\'t think my room had a refrigerator or coffee machine because there was no place to put it. I was there on business and the desk was very, very small. It\'s beauty is that is is a short walk from Penn Station, and very convenient to everything. Oh, and it does not have room service, so if you plan to eat in your room you have to bring it in yourself, or order from one of the restaurants that delivers and meet them in the lobby to get it. But bed was comfortable, and the room was clean, and it was very reasonable for NYC. I\'d stay there again.'
2,'Hotel Pennsylvania, no te dejes caer!','Por primera vez en N York, conocimos el Pennsylvania por fotos en internet, nos pareció mucho 300 U$ por noche y cuando entramos a la habitación nos pareció más caro todavía. La higiene no muy buena, los marcos de las puertas oxidados, las alfombras avejentadas, las cortinas descolgadas, en fin... deja mucho que desear. Una pena, ya que la ubicación es inmejorable.'
5,'EXQUISITE was/is The Palmer House!','We had just read The Devil in the White City (Erik Larson) and were interested in the history of Chicago and it\'s buildings. We decided to stay at The Palmer House and what a good call. As well as enjoying the extremely friendly staff and our beautiful room we loved partaking of the \'Lunch and History Tour\' with Mr. Ken Price, hotel historian. Fabulous meal and Mr. Price entertained us royally with his knowledge and humour. The stories from this hotel are colourful and many. This event was the highlight of our whole wonderful stay in Chicago. We fell totally in love with The Palmer House Hilton and it\'s past.'
3,'good hotel downtown new york','ottima la posizione \r\nla pulizia non è il massimo\r\nil personale non è il massimo\r\nè un hotel da prendere in considerazione solo se si trova un\' offerta se no il rapporto qualità prezzo non vale'
1,'Disgusting Hotel','The price is good for New York and it is in a great location.\r\nHowever, the bad reviews and nasty photos on this site regarding the Hotel Pennsylvania are no joke. This is easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed in my life. The first room they put us was nothing short of disgusting. After traveling 40 hours from Australia to New York it was heart breaking opening the door to our room. It stank of something I have never smelled before in my life. There were wires hanging out from the wall. The carpet was dirty and had stains all over it. The bed sheets were too small for the bed and had multiple cigarette burns in them. The shower leaked. \r\nWe complained and got a different room. This room was better than the first one but had many of the same problems. We complained again and got a different room that was once again only marginally better. We settled with this room simply because we were tired of complaining and arguing with staff. \r\nFor two laid back Aussies who rarely get into disagreements with people, my wife and I had to battle staff to get any kind of service. We dealt with a total of eleven staff members in one way or the other. One was very friendly and helpful. Another was not very helpful but was at least polite. The other nine were rude, unhelpful, inefficient and disinterested.\r\nWe met other tourists around New York who were paying only a little bit more for their accommodation and said their hotels had none of the problems we were having. For our next visit to this fabulous city I’m going to dig much harder for better accommodation for around this price. I know for a fact that it exists.'
1,'I would never stay here again','Do not stay in this old and dingy midtown Manhattan Hotel. The rooms are old and small. My room key malfunctioned 5 times and all the front desk would do is give me a new key. My room phone never worked. They also charge $3.50 told hold on to bags at their conceirge service. \r\nI am going back to the hampton inn across the street ....'
5,'Great Hotel - Worries about complaints totally unfounded','Shortly before travelling to NY I looked on this website for updated reviews for the Edison Hotel. I was horrified to see people complaining about the smells, cockroaches in the rooms, lack of towels, ramshackle furniture etc. As I had booked this break 10 months earlier it was going to cost me an additional £750 to change hotels. To say the least I was not looking forward to this part of our tour.\r\nI was therefore pleasantly surprised when we arrived on 17th September for 4 nights. Apart from the great location, the room was plenty big enough, the bathroom although small was adequate and while\r\nit was old it was spotlessly clean with masses of hot water. Towels (yet another complaint) were changed daily and were plentiful.\r\nAdditional pillows were provided within minutes of our request. The staff were helpful and I particularly liked it when the bell captain told the taxi driver how much we should expect to be paying so there was no fear of being ‘ripped off’.\r\nAt one end of the street you could pick up the Greyline coach for the\r\nUptown Loops and at the other end of the street you could pick up the\r\ncoach for the other Loops. \r\nThe diner attached to the hotel was excellent value and a satisfying breakfast of eggs, toast and coffee could be had for around $5.\r\nWould definitely stay here again.'
2,'Great location, not so great service','This hotel has the perfect location, it\'s literally round the corner from Times Square so right in the thick of things, in easy walking distance of the majority of New Yorks greatest attractions, however that seemed to be where the positives ended. My friend who booked the trip called the hotel before we arrived to find out of there was any other information we needed to know before arriving to be told no everything is ready. When we got there they tried to tell us we had not paid for the room when we had paid in the previous January. They then asked for a credit card for security details without making us aware they actually wanted to put a hold on 100 dollars of our spending money. We had to agree to this to be able to stay in the room but under the agreement that this would be released upon check out so we were able to spend the full amount we had saved. Check out comes around, told the money was back with us automatically, tried to spend and card was declined! Went back to speak to the hotel and suddenly the money will take 2-3 working days to go back on the card! The staff were not helpful and got angry with us when we tried to explain that the communication between staff and customers was appalling. Add into the mix that there was no hot water on the first night, their suitcase scales werent working and we didn\'t have the best stay! Make sure u ask all the above details before staying here!!'
5,'Marriott Marquis New York Location Location Location','My wife and I stayed at The Marriott Marquis Time Square in April 2007, (sorry about the delay in posting) and we both loved it. We stayed in a corner room (4221) over looking Times Square.\r\nWe had been a little nervous about the lift (elevator) system, but following a few tips that had been posted TripAdviser found them to be very easy to call and swift in their response.\r\nThe room was of a very good size and well appointed, as I would expect from a Marriott Hotel (I am a Marriott Rewards member).\r\nThe view from the hotel onto Times Square was almost worth every cent we paid for the room. Being able to walk to the theatre (we saw Jersey Boys and Lion King (again)) really made the room cost worthwhile. The fact that we could walk out one of the three entrances of the Marriott Marquis Time Square and be on our way site seeing was great and a bonus.\r\nI found the concierge desk very helpful. We enquired about going down to the ferry landing to book early tickets to go to the Statue of Liberty. We were told that it would possibly be a waste of time, not because you could not get ticket, you could, but because a storm was approaching New York and the ferries would probably not be sailing the next day. Following the concierge’s advice we slept in rather than getting up at 5:30am and discovered that New York was at the beginning of what turned out to be the wettest day in century with matching winds. The ferries did not sail.\r\nWe had a Birthday dinner in the revolving restaurant located in The Marriott Marquis Time Square and found it quite acceptable, probably not fine dinning but very acceptable for all that. Being a Birthday Dinner price was not a consideration but I thought that the price list was very much mainstream pricing for New York. The wine list was also very acceptable without being extensive.\r\nService from all the Hotel staff was very friendly. \r\nI have two criticisms of the Marriott Marquis Times Square.\r\nI had ordered Birthday flowers for my wife to be in the room when we arrived, unfortunately they were not, and but equally I was not charged for them. \r\nSecondly, in a lighter vein American Hotels need to find a stronger coffee for their percolators in the rooms for Australians as the American blends just are not strong enough. We found that even in the coffee shops we need to order extra shots in our coffee when ordering'
5,'Great Hotel! Would stay again!','Spent 4 days in NYC. The Westin is great! The room is nice, the bed is heavenly. Since we spent all of our time in the city, I can\'t comment on the food, the services or extras, but it\'s centrally located and close to everything. We were able to get great seats to Wicked from Melanie, who manages the Westin\'s theater desk. They were pricey, but it beat standing in line at TKTS for 2 hours. \r\nWe would use the Westin again!\r\nBTW, I recommend HURA, a sushi place just up 43rd from Westin near 7th.'
4,'An oasis of relaxed luxury!','Our first getaway in years, we\'re so glad we chose the Palmer House! It was relaxing, elegant, close to everything we planned to do and not extremely overpriced. We chose the historical package that included a behind the scenes tour of the hotel and a look into the history of the hotel and it\'s founders. What a treat! We highly recommend it! The room was clean and well appointed, with only the need for an update of the TV (to a wall mounted flat screen, to give more space in the room) and a chest of drawers relocated to the corner of the room. We enjoyed breakfast at the in-house restaurant each morning - wonderful oatmeal! Concierge was very helpful and pleasant.'
3,'Emplacement de choix mais personnel à revoir','Comment trouver mieux qu\'en face le Madison Square Garden, à 2 avenue de la 5ème et à 2 pas de chez Macy\'s ? Le Pennsylvania hôtel est sans doute le seul à offrir cet emplacement de rêve. Vous sortez et vous avez Penn Station (le carrefour de toutes les stations de métro et des gares).\r\nEn revanche, niveau service, ça laisse à désirer. Aucune attention, à peine aimable et pas vraiment utile. Les chambres sont de confort minimum.\r\nEn bref, c\'est bien si vous souhaitez surtout y dormir et n\'attendez rien d\'autre.'
5,'First time was great. Many more nights booked.','This is a great find close to all transportation across the street from Madison Square Garden. We had great views in a spacious suite. The staff was friendly, upbeat and professional. It also is nice that it is within a few blocks of my office. I have quite a few more nights over the next three months. booked. The windowed kitchen and full size appliances. The beakfasts were fine and the fresh juice and coffee were tops.'
3,'Ubicación muy buena, hotel pasable','La ubicación es muy buena, justo en frente del Madison Square Garden y la estación de tren y metro.\r\nEs un hotel para parar lo justo y necesario, darte una ducha , dormir un poco y seguir recorriendo la ciudad.\r\nSin comodidades,muy ajetreado y algo viejo...pero si vas a Nueva York no es para quedarte en el hotel...no?'
4,'Great NYC Value','Perfect for a girls night out! Came on the Train to Penn Station, walked out between Penn Station and Madison Square Garden up 1/2 a block and there it was! Easy to find, Great location especially when coming off the train with luggage. The hotel is nice, spacious and very reasonably priced.\r\nThere were 4 of us. We had a one bedroom suite, with 2 bathrooms, pull out couch in living room, galley kitchen. Plenty of room to sleep, freshen up before dinner with 2 bathrooms and have Happy Hour after a day of shopping in the Village. \r\nCheck in desk and concierge very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean. They upgraded us from 1 to 2 bathrooms without us asking. \r\nWould Definitely stay again and would recommend!'
4,'Nice stay on business trip','For a business trip, the location at Grand Central is perfect as you can reach everything quickly by subway.\r\nThe renovated rooms are clean and stylish, although a bit on the small side, but which hotel room isn\'t in NYC?! I espeacially liked the fact that you get replenished a medium sized tooth paste every day. :)\r\nI did not have breakfast there, but with my Hyatt Gold Club card, I could get two bottles of water at the shop each night, so that was nice!'
1,'This was the worst hotel I have ever been...','This was the worst hotel I have ever been at. The rooms are small and outdated, the bathrooms are dirty and small. The walls on the rooms have dirt and grim all over it. We up graded our room which was the Penn 5000 club, which gave us a not so better room and continental breakfast which was a bagal and Orange juice. Honestly we got treated better by the homeless guy down the street then they did. Do not stay there unless you want to throw away money.'

5,'My New Home Away from Home in NY!','What a great accidental find......I read a review that really peaked my curiosity. The review mentioned several staff members, but one stuck out, Ricky (Alvarez). When I arrived I told them I read about this hotel on Trip advisor and I wanted to meet and experience the EXCELLENT service the review spoke about. Ricky did not disappoint and exceeded his reviews as Guest Relations staff. Ricky took care of every detail of my stay personally as though I were the only guest on property. I especially loved the fact of the follow-up call within 10 minutes of checking into my room to see if everything was satisfactory. \r\nIn his absence, Leah provided an equally stellar performance in guest satisfaction. I would be remiss if I did not mention the \r\nattention & expert care that Manotte took with my room. And last but not least, for a New York hotel with 25 floors of guest rooms, the elevator system was amazing. I never waited more than 1 minute when I called for the elevator car. I won\'t say anything else, you must experience this hotel for yourself for both business and personal family travel. In this current world of hospitality and guest services.....the Park Central was a hidden treasure I am glad I found and have already made my reservations for my upcoming business trip. BJ Colwell'
4,'Great Location, Nice Hotel','They say that location is everything, and that\'s definitely the case with the Edison Hotel just off Times Square in New York City. Literally steps away from the Red Steps and the Broadway TKTS booth, the hotel\'s site on West 47th Street is about as convenient as you can get to the center of the Times Square action. So it was a pleasant surprise to find that a moderately-priced (for NYC) property could also be such a pleasant place to stay.\r\nWe were refered to the Edison by family who had stayed there previously (and who we were meeting in NYC at the hotel for a family celebration). They called it adequate. But the lobby was lovely with its Art Deco theme, and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby was bustling when we checked in, but the wait was not long and our room was ready even though we checked in prior to 3PM.\r\nYes, the Edison is an older hotel, and some of the rooms (including ours on the 16th floor) are very small and somewhat tired. However, we\'re aware that the hotel is in the midst of room renovations, and that they simply had not reached our floor yet. Regardless, the room was more than adequate for our needs.\r\nOne very positive aspect of this room (the first of two we stayed in during this visit) was the shower in the bathroom. Our experience with hotel showers is generally not good, and we didn\'t expect much this time, but were very pleasantly surprised with the excellent water pressure, as well as the height of the shower on the tub wall. My wife and I are both tall, and the shower was a wonderful treat after a day of walking the streets of New York.\r\nWe had our 16th floor room for one night, and then checked out so that we could re-check in under a different reservation when the rest of our family joined us. Our second room was on the 5th floor and was much larger, and had obviously been renovated. Shower was just as good there, too, though!\r\nAnother observation about the Edison is that the elevators were speedy--there are plenty of them, and we rarely had to wait more than a few seconds for one of them to arrive. \r\nWe\'ll definitely consider the Edison again when visiting New York.'
4,'Ottima posizione e camera confortevole','L\'hotel Park Central si trova in ottima posizione, tra la 7 th e la 56 St, di fronte al Carnegie Hall, a tre blocchi da Central Park (300 m. circa) e a pochi passi da Times Square. Il vantaggio è dovuto al fatto di trovarsi nel cuore di Midtown ma di non subirne il caos.\r\nAll\'angolo e nelle vicinanze ci sono diverse fermate della metropolitana. Comodo anche per chi arriva dall\'aeroporto JFK usando la metropolitana (linea Blu E fermata 7th).\r\n La camera assegnataci era ampia, confortevole con comodo letto King Size (più grande del matrimoniale).'
3,'Deixou a desejar','Hotel com serviço incompatível com sua classificação. Erros no check in; problemas com roupas de cama; serviço horrível do bar e do restaurante do hotel. Espera muito mais de um hotel da rede Hyatt!'
3,'Lovely lobby ,but a bit disappointing','We just came back from a three night stay at this hotel and while parts of the hotel are very impressive the overall impression was not so positive.\r\nI had read some of the reviews and was therefore prepared for a small room. Luckily our room was at the end of the hall and therefore much bigger than expected.The bathroom however was extremely small and in need of a very extreme makeover.I have to agree with one of the other reviews that the hotel is indeed cheap. You get charged excessively to use the internet, to drink the bottled water in the room and then they add a $4 dollar surcharge to any room service. The restaurants didn\'t look that inviting and the bar was nondescript.\r\nOne thing that drove me crazy was that our room was never cleaned before 3-4 in the afternoon and sometimes we would come back to the room and have to leave again because they were finally cleaning it. This kind of service is typically done as early in the day as possible, not in the late afternoon. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel is the consierge staff. They were incredibly helpful and always professional. The lobby is indeed beautiful as are the ballroom and some of the other function rooms. The hotel is very centrally located but I probably wouldn\'t stay here again.'
3,'Good points, bad points','I stayed here two nights for a conference, and got a great rate o by booking at the last minute. The room was large, as was the bed (although somewhat furrowed) and the television. But the lighting, as noted by another reviewer, is extremely difficult to figure out, and the thermostat would only go on or off, I was unable to change the high temperature.. The bathroom was fine except the shower had low pressure. The lobby is impressive in a cold, ultra modern way, but the carpets in the elevator and halls were grungy looking. Wifi is $17 per 24 hours, outrageous. Okay, it\'s New York, but it bugs me that cheaper hotels give you free wifi while the Marriotts and Hyatts hit you with a fee. \r\nI ordered a Sunday Times for the following morning, but nothing showed up by 8:30 am, and when I asked the guy in charge, he was quite unpleasant and said there were none left. I like the little cafe, and they have good espresso and very nice berries and yoghurt, but they insisted on charging me a buck for a cup of hot water for tea. The location is great, right next to Grand Central, and they have staff hanging out just to helpl. The check out woman was nice too. When I complained about the NY Times incident and the shower and the weird thermostat, I got a $50 rebate. So be a squeaky wheel, is my advice.'
5,'Refurbished Successfully!','Just back from a 5 day trip to NYC.\r\n Stayed here a few years ago and it was rather tired looking what a difference the multi million dollar\r\ninvestement has made. The original art deco style has been restored to great effect. The rooms are fresh and clean. The lobby area is as another reviewer said secure which is reassuring given how busy the hotel is. The staff at the Information Desk are very helpful and friendly.\r\nThis hotel is so well located for visitors to NYC, fantastic Macys is just a step away, Empire State Building, NY subway station on your doorstep. Tick Tock Diner open 24hours which is great if you arrive late and dont want to go out looking for a decent place to grab something to eat.\r\nHave no hesitation in recomending the New Yorker .'
4,'Beste Lage','Als New York Fan habe ich erstmals das Hilton in der 6th Avenue aufgesucht. Die Lage ist fantastisch, nahe am Central Park und nur wenige Minuten zum Times Square und dem Theater-Viertel. Das Haus ist sauber, das Personal freundlich, leider sind die Bediensteten zwischenzeitig derart gehetzt, dass man keinen ordentlichen Service (Auskünfte, frische Bettwäsche etc.) erhält. Alles in allem hat das Hotel jedoch gepasst, und ich würde wieder dorthin gehen.'
2,'No free internet after paying thro\' nose','This is a mediocre hotel charging few hundred dollar per night and no free internet! Rooms are claustrophobic matchbox holes. Location is great though! Don\'t stay unless you have business in Manhattan'
2,'Great price but still not worth it','Arrived on a HOT Saturday morning & room wasn\'t ready which was okay so pre-registered & stored luggage for $3.75/bag - what a rip off. After making it to the room we realized A/C wasn\'t working properly. We requested for room change & abruptly told only room available in entire hotel had 2 double beds so we stayed in room. Next day same thing, requested A/C to be serviced with no improvement. When we travel to NYC again, we won\'t be staying here.'

5,'Just perfect for the occasion...','Our experience during a 2-night stay in early December was delightful. Upon hearing that we were celebrating a 50th birthday, the friendly concierge upgraded us to a suite and sent champagne to the room, compliments of the Marriott Marquis. You can\'t beat the location, the beds are a dream, and the rooms are spacious. Yes, this is an expensive hotel. But for the special occasion it was just perfect!'
2,'Ancient and run down, but location is awesome.','This hotel is very old so it\'s been worn down by all New York tourists for about 100 years. The rooms are very big considering that it\'s New York but it\'s kinda dark inside & filthy. Location is very good because it\'s right next to Madison Square Garden and 34th street so there\'s tons of thing to do, plus it\'s NY so there\'s no reason to be in your room anyway. Price is average going rate of about $200 a night for 2 full beds but the remember it\'s not as sparkling clean as you want it to be.'
5,'Fantastic Hotel!!!!','My partner and I were going to New York for the first time and chose the Affinia for it\'s \'New York\' appearance. We received information from our travel agent that there was some rennovation work taking place in the lobby, concerned we contacted the hotel Manager. He was so helpful and informative, putting us at ease that we would not be affected by the work and we were moved rooms as to be as far away from the lobby as possible. Once we arrived at the hotel every member of staff we encountered was polite, friendly and very informative. I wish I had all there names to compliment them individually. I have one though which is Jorge in the restaurant who gave great service and was very informative about the Ciy and what it had to offer. The hotel went the extra mile in many ways, the holiday was a birthday celebration and we were delighted and surprised to get a bottle of wine and muffins in the room. \r\nThe rooms are modern and very clean. The bed is probably the most comfortable I\'ve ever slept in. Amazing from start to finish.\r\nI would highly reccommend the Affinia hotel and will be returning when I next visit NYC.'
4,'Loved the hotel and location','We just returned from a 4 night girl\'s weekend in NYC and were able to get the hotel for $125/night ($150 w/tax) through Priceline. We checked in very late on Thursday night and had no problem getting a room with 2 beds. We were on the 34th floor facing south and could see the river through the buildings to our west. The room was great, plenty of towels and space for 3 shopping fiends.\r\nThe 34th floor was great as you could catch one of two groups of elevators and never have to wait. The ice-machine was full and right by the service area so if you needed more soap/towels, you could have picked them up yourself too.\r\nThe only negatives were no coffee the first morning (we called, they brought it promptly and called back to make sure we had it), then no coffee set-ups the next day. After that we left a note and had plenty. We were also charged for a lint roller on our bill (only charge since we had pre-paid) and when I went downstairs the last morning they immediately took it off, even saying we don\'t offer lint rollers (so WHY was it on there?). Not a big deal, but for $8.50 + tax, worth getting taken off.\r\nThe concierge desk was wonderful. We asked for a casual close-by Japanese place the first night as our feet were completely worn out. The man there guided us to one less than 2 blocks away that was absolutely fabulous. We also found a liquor store, a breakfast spot and a restaurant in Chinatown through them - very happy with all of their recommendations!\r\nIf you go soon and are looking for a show, we highly recommend The Pajama Game with Harry Connick Jr. Not hotel related, but a definite see!'
4,'Very nice place','I was very worried after reading the reviews for this hotel after getting it on my priceline bid. That all changed once we arrived, the guy at the front desk was very helpful and pretty much let us pick our room. We ended up with a room that had double beds and more room than I have ever seen in a hotel room. The kids were able to actually run around in the room. The beds were OK but we are just used to our bed at home I guess. I am not a big fan of down pillows. The room was very clean and outside of a very strong smell of what I can only describe as some sort of cleaning agent, I have no complaints. I think charging for internet that you can get for free pretty much everywhere is a bit much but it looks to be the norm in high end hotels in town. Parking is a bit steep at 38 a night but again I have seen worse downtown. The location is perfect if you want to go for a walk. We walked to the park (two blocks away) and had dinner at Bennigans. There are not any rooms with a view because this hotel is surrounded by other building but you know that going into it. Over all I think for what we paid (100$) it was a great hotel with tons of charm and history.'
4,'Girls getaway at the Westin','I just got back last night from a girls trip to NYC. There were 9 of us total - 5 sisters, a cousin and our daughters (who are in their 20\'s). We had a wonderful trip.\r\nThe hotel is perfectly located. We all enjoyed staying so close to Times Square -where so much hectic craziness was happening.\r\nPros - we booked this hotel for its location, and the fact that we could get 2 double beds in each room. We had rooms on the 24th floor, and the hotel must have been relatively empty because we were able to get all 3 rooms right next to each other. The room was very comfortable, with super comfy beds, comforters, coffee-making facility, and 2 free bottles of water per day. The bathroom was nicely sized, supplied with soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, hairdryer, etc. Plenty of towels. Nice quiet room with no street noise. Slept very comfortably.\r\nCons - The room was on the small side. Not a tiny little closet by any means, but definitely not what I would consider a spacious hotel room. The bathroom sink was very small, and I really don\'t like it when there isn\'t much counter space to place your things in the bathroom. There is a small ledge running along the bottom of the mirror, about 3-4 feet long, but it\'s not wide enough to hold my makeup bag. At $519 I thought it was expensive. I KNOW hotels in NYC are expensive, but thought the amenities should have been better.\r\nNonetheless, when I return to NYC I\'ll likely look at staying here again. It was a nice hotel, and we loved the city.'
4,'Great hotel!','We just came back from a stay at the Edison Hotel and we loved it! I had read many reviews on how dated and dirty it was and how some even found bed bugs so I was bit concerned. The staff was very courteous to us upon arrival and even offered to lend us a crib for our baby (which we didn\'t need because we had brought our portable crib with us). I expected the room to be on the smaller side given the hotel was built in 1931 but found it to be sufficient space to accommodate my husband and baby in it. The bathroom was on the smaller side but not uncomfortable. Everything was very clean. The few imperfections we saw were normal wear and tear of a building after many years and nothing I was concerned about. I have to mention that we didn\'t stay in one of their upgraded rooms either. The bed was comfortable and there were no bed bugs. We didn\'t hear our neighbors either so we had a nice sleep. I was glad to be staying at the Edison because I have heard of the hotel so much over the years (in movies and books etc) and I was pleased with my stay. The lobby was nice and cozy and beautifully decorated for Christmas. The location was ideal for us with our baby and we felt very safe being so close to Times Square and thus able to go out late and not worry! I would definitely go back to the Edison Hotel!'
4,'nice hotel pity about the room','My wife and I stayed at this hotel 4th /7th September 2012 and found it to be perfectly placed for all must see sights,and the staff helped us in finding our way arround the area. The hotel was very spectacular with great amenities. The downside was the room which was very small with wallpaper peeling off and to our surprise there was no coffee making facility in the room (probably because there was a Starbucks in the lobby).We had booked our trip through Trailfinders so we did not pick our room and this was the only complaint we have about our stay. Great hotel,great location and very friendly,helpful staff.We would recommend this hotel when in Chicago.'
1,'Leave valuables in your room at your peril !','Just got back from New York and stayed at this hotel. Yes .. the dog show was on, and the hotel was full of dogs and there was the occasional doggie parcel left in the halls, but hey-ho, it was quite amusing to see all these dogs everywhere !\r\nWe arrived on the Monday and only 1 of our rooms was ready ... not a problem, as we were a little early. There were 15 of us in our party ( a UK based basketball team ), so we just dumped all our suitcases in the room and went off to explore Manhattan.\r\nWhen we returned, we were given the keys to approx 10 rooms and some of the names against the keys were duplicated. We had 7 keys for 1 room, 4 for another, 2 for another etc etc. We were only expecting 5 rooms, so we decided to check out all the rooms for the keys we had and choose the best 5 before handing back the remaining keys. First room we checked, looked OK. Second room, the key didn\'t work ... and in the third room, we walked in and it was clearly already occupied but no-one was there!! There was a big dog cage in there, and luckily the dog wasn\'t about. Being the honest people that we are, we decided to take all the keys back to reception and get it sorted. Eventually this was all sorted and we got settled into our correct rooms.\r\nNext morning, one of our party (a mum of one of the kids in the team) went up to pick up our Knicks tickets from Madison Square Garden, took them back to the room and we all went for breakfast in Lindys ( don\'t bother ... total rip off .. cost us $77 for 3 breakfasts !!! ). When she returne to her room, she noticed the curtains were closed and\r\n looking around realised the Knicks tickets were missing ( she\'d hidden them behind the TV ) and also all the cards for her sons birthday. There was no sign of a breakin. Nothing else was touched.\r\nShe ran outside, saw the maid and told her what happened. She then ran down to the reception to report it. They did not take it seriously at all ... in fact they seemed to think it was funny ... They then suggested that maybe it was one of our party !!! So ... lots of shouting and heated exchanges took place. In the end, the agreed to look into it. When our party member returned to her room a few minutes later, amazingly everything had been returned !!! \r\nSo ... obviously someone with a key had done it, and the only person in our party with a key to her room was her ! It doesn\'t take a genius to work it out.\r\nBack at reception, they said they\'d investigate\r\nWhen we returned that evening, she asked about the investigation and was told what investigation? What\'s the problem, you got your stuff back didn\'t you? Priceless !\r\nSo ... unless you want to carry all your valuable around with you (which we all did after that), then I\'d avoid this hotel like the plague. The rooms were passable, but this incident made sure for us that\'d we\'d never go back to this hotel.\r\nI made a point of telling as many guests as possible about the incident, so they knew just what sort of establishment this was.\r\nAnd the icing on the cake, one night, someone walked into one of our rooms whilst we were sleeping ... obviously the key mixup is commonplace, so security isn\'t very high on their agenda.\r\nAlso their attitude to the handling of the theft was appalling'
4,'Great Hotel at a budget price','My friend and I booked this hotel on the internet five months before travelling and paid 117 euros per night for a twin bedded room. My daughter found it for me and I can honestly say that it was the most central place to be. 30 steps from Times Square with all the theatres close by, shopping, etc etc. All the reviews are the same, yes it is a little tired but having said that our room was spacious - much bigger than I thought it would be having read some of the other reviews on the size of the rooms. All the staff were very pleasant from the Reception to Security to Chamber Maids. Our room was clean with fresh sheets each day for the four nights we were there, clean towels also far more than we needed. Another plus point is that we were around the side of the hotel, not such a nice view of Times Square, but very quiet and we had great nights sleep with no noise. Note if you want coffee/tea facilities they are not available in your room. We took a kettle and coffee with us as its nice to have a cuppa when you wake up. The cafe edison was very good value for money and we ate one night in the Sofia, although all the waiter seemed interested in was his tip! And the Sofia was quite expensive compared to the cafe edison. The security men on the door were a little brash and told me to get out of here when I questioned him in a joking way as to where we pick up the hop on hop off bus, but all taken in good fund. All in all if I was going back to New York I would definately stay at the Edison Hotel. Summing it all up: A little dated, clean, nice staff and incredible value for money in considering you are just off Times Square.'
4,'Great location, great service.','This hotel was a substitute for a discounted pre-pay on the Algonquin, which closed for renovations. We were offered the Crowne Plaza as a replacement and weren\'t overjoyed: we had been looking forward to the atmosphere and cabaret of the old Algonquin. Well, we were wrong: the Crowne Plaza might not have history but it\'s a great present tense hotel. Every staff person we encountered was helpful. We enjoyed watching the patience of our waiter, Sait, in the Brasserie, as he ably waited on us and still had time to pay attention to a family with two little ones. Our room had a fabulous view of the Hudson, we loved the location, and we would stay here again. Minor quibbles: the water temperature in the shower was hard to adjust and the Direct TV satellite seems to get a little wonky (cuts out). Major achievements, however, are a well-trained and good tempered staff.'
3,'SMALLEST HOTEL ROOMS IN NY','The Hudson is quite a hip and funky hotel, great location, but its more like a nightclub than a hotel. And the standard rooms are TOO SMALL!!!! nowhere to hang clothes, nowhere to even put your cases, infact there isn\'t any room for anything. At $400 a night, not exactly value for money. We ended up paying for an upgrade, so that way we didn\'t feel claustraphoibic. We always have a great time in NY, but wont be returning to the Hudson'
3,'Small rooms','We shared one room with a king sized bed overlooking the courtyard on the 12th floor. The room was quiet = that was nice. We had wifi in our room = that was nice However, overall the room was so, so small. The bathroom door couldn\'t open all the way because the toilet was in the way. We never had coffee pot/coffee in our room. The lobby was always jammed full of people. Was very below my expectations for a nice New York hotel.'
4,'Excellent location','Excellent location, loads of space, rooms excellent for this location. Restaurant in lobby is too expensive. Recommend leaving the hotel for breakfast, loads of choices outside within short walk. Staff were helpful and friendly. A bit noisy, sirens all the time.'
4,'No Poblems','Having read alot of reviews of this hotel, i must admit i was more than a little concerned.I had no need to worry. Within 5 minuets we had been checked in by a very helpful lady (it does help if you are friendly and polite to the staff). Our room although only standard had a spacious lounge, a large bedroom and a good clean bathroom.Yes the furnishings are a little dated however everything was very clean (the cleaners did a great job for the five days we stayed). The location is fantastic within walking distance of many of the sights. I recomend the hop on hop off guided bus tour by the city sights company. For $80 each this included 72 hours bus travel, addmision to the top of the empire state building, a boat cruise on the Hudson river, a boat trip to ellis island and the statue of liberty and entry to the museum of New York history. Local breakfasts are great and i suggest Folleys Irish pub (across from the empire state) for a really good meal.All in all my wife and i had a fantastic time and had no problem with this hotel'
5,'Excellent hotel centrally located','Large, modern and functional rooms. Very nice decor. Excellent for business use. Quiet in room. Excellent gym. Beautiful views of New York City. Close to everything, 3 minutes walk to Times Square. Service is very good. Nice bar. Shula\'s steakhouse in hotel.\r\nThe club room was especially nice with breakfast offering well beyond the expected. It was a very large club room with very modern decor, very functional. Didn\'t visit for evening cocktails which I regret.\r\nClose to more Starbucks than I had time to visit.'
5,'Excellent Historic Hotel','Don\'t understand all the negative reviews. The hotel is very large but I didn\'t feel the service was lacking at all.\r\nRoom: 2 Queen bedded room which was quite spacious, nice art deco motif.Very comfortable beds Bathroom was adequate with pretty light green tile.\r\nLobby was very beautiful with good service. Drinks were pricey but this is Chicago. We all loved sitting on the sofa\'s and chairs and watching the activities after a day of touring and shopping.\r\nThe Lockwood restaurant was excellent for breakfast with good food and a fantastic buffet\r\nWould recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates old historic hotels and hope to come back soon.'
4,'A Very Pleasant Experience','Just returned from a 9 night stay at the Edison. To be honest I was a bit concerned at first having read some of the reviews. However, I requested a refurbished suite and was pleasantly surprised by the accomodation. This place is not the Hyatt, but is an authentic NYC hotel. The suite was clean, with a TV and telephone in both the lounge and the bedroom. It had two walk in robes and the bathroom, whilst small, was well stocked with towels. The bed was new and was very comfortable as was the furniture in the lounge room. The staff overall were excellent apart from one young female staff member on the front desk who was particularly rude. The location is excellent and in terms of value for money I was not disappointed,'
3,'Average service, wonderful location','As a Honors member I\'ve stayed at a lot of Hiltons and was disappointed in the lack of friendliness in the service throughout my stay. It is clearly a very busy hotel in a great location, but what gets lost is that personal touch. Kudos to the concierge staff though; probably some of the best in the city.'
4,'Good central location','Hotel is across the road from Penn Station so is ideal if you are flying i n from Newark Airport. Asked for quiet room as had read pevious reviews about noisy rooms. Room was quiet and had been nicely refurbished though small it was quite adequate. Ate in the Nile restaurant and it was very good but be aware that the bottle of water in the middle of the table will cost you seven dollars.'
4,'Best Stay in Midtown','Southgate lives up to all the positive reviews. For only $119.00/night (Expedia), my son & I were treated to 2 queen beds in a clean & spacious 1-room studio suite. When they did not have a studio avail. at our 2:30 AM arrival on our first of 4 nights, they upgraded us for no extra charge that one night to a 2-room bedroom suite. Everything was clean & in good shape (including baths), & staff was friendly & helpful. Only negatives, though minor, were occasional street noise, and the small 1929 bath room.'
3,'Not Impressed -Okay experience','I have been at this Hotel in the past and never had any bad experiences with the Hotel or with the Room. \r\nMy niece and I were there for a Bridal shower in March. The room was okay. Inside room. Shower handle was broken, we were missing the toilet paper holder, but they did bring that up. The cleaning person must have called that one in. We set the air conditioner on HIGH but it only cooled the room a little. \r\nThe Front Desk Hotel Clerk -Ellen- was exceptional. She is an assett to this Hotel. It was a pleasure having her as a person to speak too.\r\nKathy'
2,'Don\'t Buy Tickets','The stand in the lobby selling tickets to shows, attractions and baseball games is not run by the hotel. We purchased three tickets to a New York Yankees baseball game from the ticket seller and he informed us that the seats we four rows up between home and first. Well, the seats were between home and first base, but they were four rows up from a metal bar located approximately 35 rows back. We were also informed that a small commission was charged in addition to the cost of the ticket. We paid $100. each for the tickets and later looked at the tickets and they only cost $50. each. We have contacted the manager regarding this, but so far nothing has happened. We later found out that some of the Westin staff do not recommend this service. They have had numerous complaints from guests, buy keep letting guests get ripped off by the vendor they use for this service. I would not recommend this hotel!'
3,'Decent hotel, good customer service, really small rooms though','I stayed at this hotel on October 11-14th. My experience was awful at first but management did make an effort so would I recommend this place? I think it’s a little bit overpriced and they do have their issues but overall, their employees are very nice (except for one) so I would recommend this place if you get a good deal (preferably less than $200 a night). I’ve managed to get 4 star hotels for less than $200 usually but through playing the ‘name your price’ thing so its up to you. I think it’s a good hotel but if you get stuck in room 826, I would ask to change your room IMMEDIATELY because its right by the housekeeper’s service room and it is loud as heck.\r\nThe cons: EXTREMELY LOUD if you’re by the service room, smells throughout the hallways & elevators, tiny petite rooms, no furniture to put your things away, closet is already full so no room to put your suitcase away, and no ice machines. I even had a huge moth flying in my room? And yes it is near Penn Station but if you’re a tourist, you’re better off at Grand Central or at Herald Square if you want to be close to a subway. I never once got off of Penn Station during my entire trip despite riding the subway at least 4 times each day.\r\nThe only negative thing I was really unhappy about (aside from the noise from the service room) was that the person who checked us in was a bit rude. I usually ask if it’s possible to upgrade since hotels are usually so nice about it even if they can’t upgrade you but the front desk person said, Absolutely not because of the Way I booked my reservation. I didn’t save much at all since it was such a busy time so I was surprised at how condescending she was about it. I’ve stayed at 4 star hotels and never received that type of rudeness for using a deal site. Actually, the same day I checked out of this hotel, I checked in to the Waldorf and they very generously upgraded me as well as giving me drink vouchers for my birthday. For the record, Affinia does not do anything for your birthday. She also did not mention anything about the free ‘experience kits’ so I called down later to ask for it. They were pretty neat.\r\nWarning, their petite rooms are small, even for NY. I’ve included pictures but it did come as a bit of a shock because there wasn’t really any room to put our two suitcases (carry on) so they were pretty much in our way the entire time. The closet was also full so no room there. The bathroom is incredibly tiny though and there is really only one spot you can stand.\r\nPros: all the employees my guest and I encountered during our trip (except for the front desk host) were incredibly nice. I spoke with 2 managers, the people who brought our ice, the person who brought our experience kit, and a few others and they were all very friendly. After a sleepless night of hearing laundry carts being thrown around by housekeepers, I finally called the front desk host around 4am but no response. After a few more attempts, I e-mailed a manager. He responded by saying he asked the housekeepers to not make so much noise and asked to speak with me. Since I was out, I asked him to just keep e-mailing me instead. He later said he would upgrade my room so I wouldn’t have to have another sleepless night. By the way, I also was able to hear the elevators going up and down (service elevators and guest elevators) and even the ‘ding’ they made. The manager, Spiro, told me they were holding a room for me and all I would need to do is pack my things and they would help move them for me. However later when I finally got to the hotel (in the evening), they told me my room was actually unavailable and it was going to take another day. He also e-mailed me saying he would still like me to speak with a manager so I finally called the front desk after another sleepless night and spoke with the manager Michael, around 5am. He said he had no idea of any of my complaints but was very friendly and attentive. He even knew that being next to the service room was super loud, about the banging on the walls, hearing the elevators, and etc. He said right away that he would upgrade us to a suite. I thought that was very generous considering I gave him a much abbreviated run down of why I was asked to speak to a manager, but he would upgrade us that much. The suite was great – very spacious, view of the street, and on a high floor.\r\nSo in conclusion: service was great except for a minor hiccup, ‘petite room’ is really petite, and the hotel overall is decent. I think as long as you are fully aware of how small the rooms are, then it’s a perfectly good hotel.'
4,'Great Hotel!','We stayed here for a week, end of Sept - October.\r\nThe staff were extremely pleasant and always helpful.\r\nLobby has been recently redecorated, think rooms probably due for the same to bring it all up to the level it should be.\r\nHowever, room was clean and it had all amenities needed, good to have a kitchen within room. Bathroom a little small, but adequate, beds excellent, slept really well. \r\nOur room on the 5 floor next door to the fire station was amazingly quiet for its position and we had no problems sleeping. The view of the Empire State Building from the window was fantastic!\r\nClose by to everything you could want in NYC!\r\nWould stay here again!'
5,'Karen Front Desk Manager Fantastic','I contacted Karen prior to arrival asking for help looking for the right room for my 79 parents. You might expect a hotel in the middle of times square not to have time for special requests...wrong. Karen took control and made sure that each of my requests was met. GREAT service!'
4,'Customer Service','This is the fourth time I have stayed at the Park Central hotel and its always a very pleasant experience for me. The staff was great in helping me and going out of their way to be of assistance to me. The rates were incredible for a five night stay and when I come back to NY, I\'ll be checking into Park Central!'
5,'Spring Break trip with two adult girlfriends and two girl 19 year olds','The hotel was beautiful - from the lobby, to the elevators, to the rooms and the view from the top. GREAT location!!'
5,'Great hotel','Great hotel. Good location and good price. I will be staying here again. The rooms are a good size the NYC.\r\nI didn\'t eat in the hotel, only used the concierge to book some theatre tickets and he was very helpful.'
4,'Fantastic Location','We visited New York at the end of January 2012 and stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and we were very happy with the service. The hotel is about a half hour taxi ride from JFK. The hotel room was a decent size, was kept very clean, the staff were polite and although we never ate in the restaurant we did take advantage of the Grab and Go service for breakfast sometimes (coffee, bagels, danish pastries etc). We had booked two rooms as a family of four, one was on the 25th floor, the other on the 45th floor and I was expecting the rooms to be next door to each other. We had coffee making facilities in our room and complimentary bottles of water and chocolates left on the first two days. Our room had a decent sized shower, however the other room had a bath. Elevators were very quick up to your room. Hotel is opposite the M&M\'s store, next door to Hershey\'s and the Disney store is only half a dozen shops down. There is also a McDonalds which was handy for a cheap breakfast. You cannot beat the location of the hotel - right in the heart of Times Square and everything apart from the World Trade Centre location is within walking distance. We went to the Rockefeller Centre, Central Park, Schwartz toy store, Macy\'s and did lots of shopping - all within easy walking distance of hotel. The horse drawn carriage ride round Central Park was amazing, but remember to haggle as we were initially quoted quite a high price, but then another guy offered us the same trip for 10 dollars less. You will get hassled by people trying to sell you tickets for Broadway and NYC sightseeing trips upon leaving the hotel but you will probably get that anywhere. We booked a bus tour through our holiday operator when we met our Rep in NYC and I can recommend the Downtown loop tour. You get to hop on / hop off at any stop you want and another bus comes along every 15-20 minutes. Just remember to sit down on the open-top bus upstairs, as the front of the bus sometimes hit the road signs which are hanging down, so watch your head! You get to see so many of the main attractions NYC has to offer on this bus route and it takes you right down to the World Trade Centre, past the United Nations building, Madison Square garden, Empire State building, Chinatown, Little Italy, Fifth Avenue etc. One of the last stops before it turns back is the Staten Island ferry (the ferry is free) where you can get amazing views of the Statue of Liberty and we took some fantastic photos of NY as we sailed away from the city. The NYC taxis are reasonable to and from the airport, if you can handle the excitement! We never used the subway as felt we would miss out on the sight-seeing so we felt the bus was the best option and the cost was very reasonable considering the ticket is valid for 24 hours. You also get to hear some interesting facts from the tour guides on the bus. We went to Chinatown but were disappointed, so didn\'t hang around for long, we couldn\'t find any decent restaurants, so headed back to the bus stop. Times Square restaurants are quite expensive so if you step just outside this area there are cheaper places to eat. The restaurants heading up to Central Park are cheaper and we went to Applebee\'s and received very good service and excellent food / drink. We also went to Mario\'s pizza place which was very good food. We can highly recommend Pershing Square for breakfast, which is right by Grand Central station - try the New Yorker breakfast, was soooo tasty. This place was recommended by our friends and we were not disappointed. Great service, amazing food and plenty of it - set us right for the rest of the day!. If you like Starbucks they had just a few! but lots of choice and other places to eat - you were spoilt for choice. There are a few Levi stores as well and you can buy some jeans for as cheap as $26 in the sale. Macy\'s also offer you 10\% off goods if you show photo ID. Remember the tax, and on some food bills you can get charged up to 18\% gratitude but we were told by our Rep if you don\'t receive good service you do not have to pay it - however we never received a bad service. Overall this was a great trip to NY, we saw plenty of sights in 4 days and mainly walked everywhere (apart from 1 day on the bus tour). Weather was fantastic, in fact you could have worn a t-shirt on the last day as the weather was so mild. Didn\'t spend much time in hotel, as obviously we were out most of the day, but would recommend this hotel to others - you cannot get a better location than this.'
4,'Grand Hyatt - NYC','Good location right next to Grand Central Station but a fair walk to other sites...small rooms, fair service...no complimentary breakfast served...'
5,'Great for Business Travelers','This was a great hotel to relax and kickback in after sitting through meetings all day. It is a good location if you want to go out and have dinner; or you could stay in and eat at the Lockwood and have a drink in the beautiful lobby. I was lucky to be upgraded to a King Suite. My colleague was not so lucky, and was in the Double Double room and it was VERY tiny. The hotel was full the first two days we stayed so she was unable to move, but the staff was able to move her to a more comfortable room for our last 3 nights there. The staff was very helpful and the concierge service was excellent.'
4,'Better than expected......','Having read some of the reviews shortly before my visit i was apprehensive about what we would find. We are a couple - now both in our fifties having celebrated my 50th on this trip. The hotel was young, trendy but certainly not off putting for those a little older in years!! The dark reception is difficult on the eyes but very atmospheric, The music was upbeat but pleasant and toe tapping in the lifts. The staff were very friendly and helpful - we didn\'t experience any \'attitude\' expressed in previous reviews. We were on the 12th floor over looking the courtyard and experienced no unreasonable noise and due to the amount of time spent sightseeing and walking - by the time our heads hit the lovely clean soft pillows - we had no trouble sleeping. I think we were very fortunate in having one of the larger rooms in the hotel and our room was perfectly functional, plenty of space for hanging clothes, storing suitcases and shopping and moving around. The bathroom was also a perfectly adequate hotel sized bathroom - modern, clean and lovely towels and toiletries provided. With regards to water in the rooms there were vending machines on every floor outside the lifts with drinks and snacks available and an Ice machine - easy to pick up on your way to your room.The location is excellent and we walked to most of the major attractions - very convenient for central park, Times Sq and Broadway. Lots of places to eat and drink close by and not overly priced. We would definitely choose this hotel again and would recommend it to others but I think from reading other reviews the size of the room you get is probably key to the overall experience.'
4,'The potential for an enjoyable experience','I was bought a room in the Westin as a birthday present from a family member who has a priority membership with this chain of hotels. As a result, we were treated very well and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I cannot comment on what a more average stay would have been like, however. We had already spent two nights at a cheaper hotel two blocks up the street, and had been impressed with what they had to offer. On arrival at the Westin, we were greeted by a somewhat frosty receptionist (not, in our experience, typical of New Yorkers), who informed us that we had been upgraded to a corner room. On arriving at our 25th floor allocation, we found the key did not work, so my partner had to travel back down (in the somewhat alarmingly rapid elevators!) to see what was wrong: we were issued with a key for a different, but comparable, room, but no member of staff accompanied to check that this was now okay. My partner was simply told: It will be the lock that\'s malfunctioning. Luckily, this key worked, and the room was incredible. The views over Manhattan were so fantastic that I insisted on sleeping with the drapes open! Everything was spotless and well-presented; I was particularly impressed with the Starbucks coffee in the room and the quality toiletries. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard. Slightly disappointed that the minibar was inexplicably locked, but this was countered by the executive lounge access that came with our upgrade. The lounge was staffed by superbly polite, warmly attentive representatives, and offered not only Internet access but also complimentary drinks, breakfast and snacks of the highest standard. We were deeply impressed. \r\nI was slightly disappointed that no effort was made to offer assistance up the escalators with our (heavy!) bags on arrival, but special mention must go to the gentleman on duty as Concierge during our stay, who was utterly charming and helpful, and who represented the Westin, and New Yorkers, admirably. We would certainly consider staying on another occasion.'
4,'Good but not Great','Good room at the Executive Level. It was quiet and large for New York standards. To pay extra to stay at Executive Level room is only worth it because of the free WiFi at their lounge. Otherwise the free food is not that great and it\'s very limited in variety.\r\nCentrally located between Times Square and Central Park.'
4,'marriott times square- location, location','My sister and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Marriott Times Square. It is near Times Square, on 40th street, but quiet at night. Staff very friendly and helpful. A delightful visit. \r\nWe also enjoyed the Pig and Whistle Pub on 47th street near Broadway.\r\nWe had the pleasure of seeing Les Paul at the Iridium, and recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of Les Paul. The people near us had come from far away to see him.'
4,'clara e renny','the first to manhattan... prima di partire avevo letto alcune recensioni negative ...dalle quali mi dissocio assolutamente....buon albergo ,posizione strategica,colazioni buonissime ed abbondanti ,personale abbastanza disponibile, camera al 16 piano:pulita forse il bagno ....con una doccia dell anteguerra...!ma complessivamente un hotel da consigliare...!'
1,'Dirty rooms and unfriendly staff','I\'m staying here right now in room 2115. We are part of the big group from MIT. I found the check in too long. We were in the queue for 15 mins. Considering the school had 100 rooms booked they could have done a group check in. \r\nThe room was dirty with hair in the bathroom and on the bed. The desk chair had torn and worn out leather. The bathroom tap is leaking. It did not give me a feeling of being a hygienic place. For the money they are charging its a rip off. Avoid at all costs.'
5,'Great location and service','Elegant style and atmosphere that you don\'t see much anymore.\r\nRight in the heart of downtown Chicago, close to shopping, resturants, transportation, and activities.\r\nStaff was extremely helpful, especially the concierge.\r\nCan\'t wait to visit again.'
1,'Funky bar but little else','Funky bar with cool outdoor area but basically that\'s it. Hotel was under renovation but booking did not mention this. Rooms are tiny, but that\'s not a surprise in NYC. When you arrive you won\'t get any assistance with bags, etc (even though I was with someone who is six months pregnant). Service is generally pretty surly on the front desk. We were receiving an important package (which I knew had arrived) and the girl on reception barely gave us the time of day. Because it wasn\'t on the system, there was no way it could be in the building. I asked her to call the mail room, which she did reluctantly, rolling her eyes and confirmed nothing arrived. I went down myself and found the package had been delivered and lying in a corner but no-one had made the effort to try to find it. Generally sums up the service - not a lot of effort.'
3,'Great Location - Average Product','The hotel is well located but it is an older hotel and while renovations may have been done some problems remain such as small bathroom (shower in bathtub that leaks water no matter how hard you try and stop it making for a very wet floor), major delays for guest room elevators at times and old sitcom system making for a noisy meeting. Service quality also a little inconsistent although no major complaints.'
4,'The truth about Park Central','Myself and my friend stayed in Park central on 14th-17th feb and spent the last night at The Plaza. It was £270 for the 3 nights, so going halfers on that worked out pretty cheap. Before talking about the hotel, the location can not be any better, its close to everything!! The bottom line is that, yes, the staff at reception will treat you like dirt (from what I found) but just try and bite your tongue, as I ended up with a room that was clean and big. The bathroom was small, but it did the job! In general the hotel was clean and value for money. Beds were fine etc.. At the end of the day when you visit New York, you are only going to be using the hotel for sleeping, and it more than did the job. I would go back to this hotel. \r\nAlthough it did not bother me, its a shame the staff let it down, if the staff sorted their attitude out then you really could not fault them.'
3,'Started off great but.','Our first night was okay room was small and bathroom dated but everything was clean and tidy, staff very good. The next day no hot water and no A/C. Okay they will fix by next day. Hello no 3 days later still no hot water or A/C. Record temps in New York Edison Hotel staff guess maybe tomorrow, we have 2 days to go Holiday a nightmare, ring and check before you come.'
4,'Great value, great staff','Would recommend this hotel, I will stay here on my next visit. \r\nI Stayed for 4 nights. Only 1 block from Central Park, a short walk to Broadway and Times Sq. Access to subway is 20 feet from the door of the hotel. \r\nRoom rate was competitive compared to other hotels I checked out nearby, and they do special offers on their website. \r\nAll the staff were welcoming and friendly, I was checked in by Elizabeth. The front desk sorted out a room key which wouldn\'t work on my last day by sending up security to open the door which only took less than 5 minutes. \r\nAll the bar staff in the hotel bar were very friendly and look after the guests well, \r\nJohn in particular. \r\nA pleasure staying there each day.'
4,'LOVED THE AMBIENCE!','Perfect location for the theaters and Times Square! Comfy bed, but our bathroom was very small. Nothing fancy but clean and very adequate. We were on the front side facing the street (9th floor) and I had to buy earplugs b/c the noise woke me up at 5:30 am. That\'s just NYC! The coffee shop was excellent for breakfast. The bar late at night was just right. I don\'t think there was room service and no iron or coffee pot in room. I paid $140 AAA rate. Would definitely stay there again. Very safe and location was fantastic!!!'
3,'Average at best','Crowne Plaza Times square... stayed there last week 8th April, 2012. \r\nWe had requested a Times Square view room, and wow what a view. As I recall the room was 3011 and right opposite the lifts which we thought would be noisy. But not the case.\r\nThe food around Times Square was ordinary and expensive. The hotel was nice enough. the bar was on level 2 with virtually no view, the Manhattan cocktail was soo strong.\r\nThe hotel had no safe, well a safe you had to swipe with your credit card... no will not do that, what if you lost your card or it was stolen... Had to have my passport with me all the time, was a pain.\r\nNo fridge, no safe, was a water heater thingie, but no cups. So did not bother.\r\nThe shower was the standard bathtub with shower overhead. The bed King size was comfy and clean and I checked for bed bugs, all seemed ok and after sleeping was ok, no itching.\r\nI had trouble sleeping 30 floors up, my body kept feeling it was falling, but did it for three nights, and glad to come home.\r\nThe breakfast was underwhelming and the hotel in general was underwhelming - but expensive. \r\nOne of our backpacks had been opened during the day, so not sure about the security, but all our electronic equipment was locked in a suitcase while we were out of the room because of the no safe issue.\r\nNext time in New York I would love to find an apartment and stay for longer and really look around, perhaps a month and visit other places. NYC is interesting and multi layered place, but a like it a lot'
4,'It\' OK for NY standards....','Old - Betiful view - Go there if you do not know NY....it\'s central'
4,'Amazing location, acceptable room','Location, location, location. Bang opposite Penn Station and an easy walk to most of the Midtown attractions, if there is one reason to stay here, it is location. The giant, almost-swanky, ever-crowded lobby is not a predictor of the size of the rooms. But it was sweet of the check-in staff to allow us access to the room way before the stated check-in time of 2pm. The rooms are way smaller, situated in labyrinthine floors, but then, when you have to put 90 rooms at every level, one has to expect this. We were on the 9th floor. The corridor walls had peeling paint and the door did look old, but the room itself was spacious (by NYC standards) and well-equipped - the TV worked and so did the electrical fittings, the room was clean, the bed got made up every day and the bath linens replaced. Some of the bath fittings were a little rusted, but they worked fine, so no complaints.\r\nWe didn\'t bother with breakfast in the hotel as there are enough and more places within walking distance of a block or two that can get you started for the morning with a quick bagel and coffee.\r\nOverall, good value for a clean, quiet couple of nights and the amazing location.'
1,'$479 a night and they charge for wifi!','Aside from the title the rooms were cramped and my view is the side of a building. Plus who wants to go downstairs and be in the middle of grand central station. This is probably the most overpriced and over rated hotel in New York.'
5,'Great location. Traveled with 2 year old...','Great location. Traveled with 2 year old and found this hotel met our needs, except that from the main entrance you had to go up stairs/escalator and no elevators, so coming in on wheelchair or stroller required using a back entrance that often didn\'t work. Apart from that, great place.'
5,'Can\'t wait to return','Magnificent location! Easiest check-in, check-out, and baggage claim I have everexperienced. The entire in-out process took less than a minute. Enough elevators to service the large hotel during a busy weekend. On top of Grand Central Station so a food court is right beneath you and if your destination is too far to walk, just grab a train! Spacious lobby with nice marble fountain. Clean rooms, almost spacious by Manhattan standards, even included a big closet! I\'ll stay there again!'
3,'Average Hotel in excellent location','Location is perfect. We travelled as a family with 2 children. Room was fine, nothing spectacular or particularly luxurious about it but clean and adequate. There was not enough storage space for our clothes though, so lived out of our suitcases. Also we were not left enough towels every day either. During our stay we had a problem with our hot water, the shower started off hot then just as you had finishing washing your hair and was full of shampoo it went stone cold. After I had reported it someone was sent to fix it. The next day the same thing happened again and after I had reported it for a second time was told someone was going to see to it. However during the remaining 3 days of my stay it wasnt fixed so we took to taking showers after our afternoon swin.\r\nThe reason I booked this hotel was because of the pool as not many hotels in New York appear to have a swimming pool. Upon arrival at the pool I was disappointed that there is a charge for using the pool as nothing was mentioned to me about paying on my booking through Expedia. I was told the health club is a private club and nothing to do with the hotel. You also have to pay for swimming hats. The pool was tiny and freezing cold. I was told hotel guests can only use 1 lane of the lap pool and then you only get a 30 minute slot. As I travelled with children this was not brilliant or what I was expecting. \r\nOverall a pleasant enough stay.'
4,'Claustrophobic rooms but cool hotel','The Hotel Hudson is a sleek, hip hotel in a great location near Columbus Circle. The hotel is so hip that there is no sign on the front of it (or even a building number) - you just have to know that you have arrived. The lobby and bar feel like a trendy nightclub, with ultra-cool decor and 24-hour lounge music. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and Zen feeling, but VERY, VERY SMALL, even by New York standards. Our room felt like a closet - there was only enough space for a double bed with two feet of floor on either side of it. There wasn\'t even enough space to lay our suitcases on the floor to unpack them. There was a tiny TV and one tiny desk to put our belongings. The bathroom was so small that my knees hit the wall when I sat on the toilet (I am average height). I would not recommend staying here if you are claustrophobic. If you don\'t mind a microscopic room, though, it\'s a fun place to stay and you can\'t beat the location.'
4,'1A Lage und frisch renoviert','Das Grand Hyatt in New York besticht durch die perfekte Lage direkt am Grand Central Terminal. man kann sozusagen mit dem Hotelaufzug bis ins Terminal fahren und erreicht mit der Ubahn alle ganz Manhatten. Auch zu Fuß ist man z.B. in ca. 15 min am Times Square.\r\nDie Hotellobby ist sehr beeindruckend und wir konnten ohne Wartezeit direkt zum Check-in. Unser Zimmer hatte wzar nicht den besten Blick (zum Hof) war aber sehr geräumig und gut ausgestattet. Wir haben im Hotel werder gefrühstückt noch etwas anderes gegessen und können daher keine Angaben zum Essen machen.\r\nDer von uns gezahlte Preis in einer Rabattaktion war absolut gerechtfertigt für dieses super Hotel. Ob ich die regulären Übernachtungspreise zu zahlen bereit wäre weiß ich allerdings nicht wirklich.'
5,'Spot on for service & location!','Soooooo close to everything: subways, theatre district and more. The concierge service was awesome giving the best advice as only locals can. Will definitely stay again. Thanks guys!!'

5,'Ideal location with large rooms','While attending a conference last week I booked my room at the Marriott Marquis online for a 5 night stay. Lckily the conference hasd blocked a number rooms at a good rate. Make sure you factor in City and State taxes !!\r\nThe hotel is right in the heart of Times Square. My wife loved the room size which is 400+ sq feet. The view of Times Square was awesome. Check-in and check out was easy and the all the staff are professional and friendly. Ths is a huge hotel with some 44? floors... and the Elevator system is great, it is situated in the cente in almost a circle and outside elevators have a window views. The elevators a very quick going up and down. The beds are awesome, most comfortable beds I have been in so far during my business travels. I forgot to remove the bed sheets and find out what make and model the bedding was.'
5,'Great Hotel; Great Location','We stayed for 2 nights at the end of January. This Marriott has recently undergone a major renovation and it showed. The elevator problem mentioned in earlier reviews appears to be fixed; they have a new system in place and I don\'t think we waited longer than 2 or 3 minutes for an elevator. We arrived at the hotel at 7 am and they actually had a room ready for us and let us check in early. Room was great - over looking Times Square. Great view, no noise, comfortable bed, clean room. Couldn\'t have asked for anything more. The best part was the proximity to everything (except the best restaurants - those are over by Central Park but it\'s only a 10-15 minute cab ride). We saw a show at the Russell Theater and it was only 1 block from the hotel! Would definitely stay here again.'
3,'So hip it hurts','I\'ve stayed here several times - for leisure and for business. Upon entry, the lobby is quite impressive as you go up the escalator. Front desk staff wear black and look like models. They\'re not overly friendly but not rude either. The hallways are very dark, almost scary. As you walk to your room, you may encounter very dark hallway which presumably go to stairwells or to housekeeping closets. Its so dark, someone could easily be hiding there and you wouldn\'t know it. I don\'t know why they keep it so dark - is it to save on electricity bills or so you don\'t notice the shabby hallway carpet?!\r\nThe last time I stayed here, their reservation systems were down so they upgraded my room from a single queen to a double queen. What a difference that made! The single queen room is quite small. There is very little walking space between the bed and the wall. The theme of low lighting is continued from the hallway to your room. Considering the walls are a dark wood paneling, it feels very cave like. The bathroom on the other hand is clinical - with its bright white tiling and stainless steel furnishings. The positioning of the toilet in the single queen room is very close to the wall. I don\'t know how anyone who is taller than 5\'7 could comfortably do their business without knocking their knees on the wall in front of the toilet. The hotel tries to address claustrophobic tendencies by having the mini bathtub/shower stall open to the bedroom area, separated by a glass wall. The larger room with 2 beds is way more spacious but it comes at a cost. The walls and doors are pretty thin. You can hear people showering and watching TV as you walk by their rooms. The TV is pretty small and its not a flat screen. I expect higher quality furnishings from a hip & trendy  hotel.\r\nThe Cafeteria restaurant downstairs serves excellent food, although its a bit overpriced. But then again, it IS a hotel restaurant and those tend to be overpriced. The location is excellent, a couple blocks from Central Park. The Time Warner building is across the street from the hotel - you can access the subway from here and if you want a quick bite, there\'s also a Whole Foods downstairs which has an extensive salad / hot foods bar. If you have a sweet tooth, there\'s a Pinkberry a few doors down.\r\nThis hotel is not suited for families - I\'ve never seen anyone under the age of 20 staying here. Its better suited for business travel, but only if you plan on being there for a couple nights.'
4,'Nice Location if You Don\'t Mind Crowds!','We just got back from staying at the Crown Plaza. We thought we\'d try to stay in town this time rather than in SoHo or Manhattan. The vibe is totally different...this is a busy, busy place. As soon as you step on the street, you are in the heart of Times Square! \r\nAs far as the stay itself, there was a nice area to pull through to unload and valet park. We did pay over $50 a night fore valet of a SUV. From the start, all of the staff was very kind and helpful. We arrived very early in the morning and check-in was not until later in the afternoon. We were able to use the valet to park and were allowed to pre-register. Our room was ready around 1:00. We were on the 22nd floor with a view of some other buildings and a slight view of the river. The room was very clean, comfy, and all we needed for a basic stay. There was no microwave or frig, however, there was a Keurig machine. Checking out was easy and the car was pulled around quickly. \r\nOverall, it was very nice. If you want to be in the heart of NYC, this is a nice place to stay.'
5,'Good location, good rooms','The Hilton is well situated in the middle of Midtown, within walking distance of Central Park and Columbus Circle. Other neighborhoods are easily reached by cab or by bus. The room was large by New York standards and had been recently renovated with nice decor. There were Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, which were a nice touch. The walls are a bit thin so it can be a bit noisy when people are in the halls. The lobby is small and has limited seating but I don\'t think this is a big issue. Check-in and out was quick and fairly friendly.'
4,'Questo hotel ci piace molto!!!','Io e la mia fidanzata siamo stati in questo hotel per 8 notti a cavallo tra Luglio e Agosto 2011. Con la tariffa prepagata abbiamo speso 56 euro a testa per la camera Standard. Stanza piccola ma con tutte le comodita\'. Poi per chi vuole vivere la NY notturna...'
2,'Average Experience','Stayed the weekend in this hotel and was somewhat disappointed. Very small bathroom as other reviewers have noted, with no ventilation and all the signs of damgae from humidity (mold on the shower curtain, peeling paint on the wall) and this in an upgraded room.\r\nWould I stay again -NO - there are better options.'
4,'Great hotel, great location really enjoyed our stay','Stayed in the Crowne Plaza for 4 nights on a 2 week holiday to the US and really enjoyed it. Hotel is right on Times Sq (little bit busy for me) but great location for everything you need in NY. Rooms very nice size as I hear from friends that you can get some really bad rooms in NY. 180 degree views of the area as we were on the 30th Floor. Nice bar area with friendly staff. Were told to go to 9th Avenue for good food and that was the best advice we got on our whole trip. Loved NY and would go back in a minute and stay here again. Rooms clean, good size cant really say anything negative....'
5,'Excelente ubicacion, desayuno completisimo en promocion, lastima el costo del internet','Cerca de todo en manhatan e incluso de times square\r\nPague pocos dolares por desayuno incluido y delicioso eel buffet\r\nLastima el costo del internet, excelente el baño, la cama, las toallas y la limpieza. Estuve 6 noches con mi esposa y mi hija devocho años'
5,'Great Spot in Manhatten','Loved the location of this hotel - stayed in 1 room with 2 queens with a 2yo and 4yo. the Biggest toys r us ever seen across the road. Great access to broadway musicals.. I love NYC... and cant wait to get back..'
1,'Don\'t Bother','Please stay somewhere else. Manager at front desk rude and condescending. He claimed that our reservation was for a different type of room instead of what we reserved - Times Square view- basically called us liars. Thank God I had the original email confirming reservation, because he claimed that the confirmation number we gave him was for a different type of a room such a BS - never had such an issue at any other hotel. Even when he was proven wrong, he never apologized. The whole episode spoiled entire weekend. Needless to say, we will not be staying there again.'
4,'Great Location, Clean and a good base for touring New York from','We wanted a good hotel that we could use as a base for our recent trip to New York.\r\nWe didn\'t want or need a 5* hotel as we would spend the days and nights out around Manhattan.\r\nThe Hilton NY is in a great location 5 mins from Central Park, 15 mins from the Upper East Side and a 5min walk from the Rockerfeller Centre. So it is a good choice for a mid-town location.\r\nThe room was recently refurbished and plenty big enough. \r\nI would certainly use the Hilton NY again for leisure or business.'
5,'Amazing Level of Service','I can\'t say enough great things about our stay here. We had a block of rooms for our wedding weekend and everyone received exceptional service. From the moment of check in, to the room service, housekeeping, bellman, bar staff, event managers, etc, everything was handled impeccably and with a wonderful welcoming atmosphere. No request we made was too big or too small--and we made a lot! Absolutely exceptional service by people who seemed to enjoy their work!\r\nThe standard rooms seemed very nice, but small as would be expected in a hotel of this age. We had a suite, which was very reasonably priced and absolutely huge, so that may be a good option for those looking for more space.'
4,'Staying at hotel is a plus in order to be close to everything','The hotel is located in a great spot. It is across the way from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. It is close to all the spots you will want to visit and those that are kinda far, you can take the subway. The hotel staff are great and very helpful. The outside of the hotel and the lobby are nice. The rooms are roomy but do need to be updated alittle. It\'s a clean hotel and they offer a selection of pillows and kits that can be helpful. The bar and restaurant are nice but alittle pricey. Most of the rooms do not offer much of a view unless you are facing 7th Ave. I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite that had 2 bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. It can get noisy due to the traffic, but not a big deal.'
3,'Potrebbe essere meglio','Hall fantastica e scenografica ma le stanze non sono così belle!! Un hotel vecchio ma rimesso a nuovo, bagno piccolissimo e moquette vecchia, insomma non all\'altezza di un Grand Hyatt 4stelle a New York! Per quanto riguarda la posizione: eccezionale!!! Sei in pieno centro a 3 isolati da Time Square, di fianco a Grand Central Terminal e al Chrisler, che se sei fortunato vedi dalla camera!!!'
4,'Great Location!!!!!!','After reading various negative reviews of The New Yorker, I was very tempted to cancel the hotel, and search for another one, I was pleased that I didn\'t. The taxi fare to the hotel from JFK is a fixed rate of $45 plus approx $5 for the toll. Check in was quick and straight forward...staff weren\'t very smiley, but I wasn\'t planning to hang around for a chat. Security at the hotel is great, guests need to show their room key to get past. I was allocated a room on the 22nd floor, there are plenty of lifts. The room was a double/double, side view, a double/double room does make the room appear a bit smaller, but it\'s not too bad. The room was very clean, bathroom was clean, and more than enough towels are supplied. The hairdrier is quite powerful, there is only one negative thing I can think of, and that is that the shower isn\'t powerful, but again it\'s bearable. Shampoo and Body Gel bottles are supplied and replaced if necessary.\r\nLocation: the location of the hotel is fantastic...minutes walk to Macys, and The Empire State Building, come out of the hotel, turn right and than left at the traffic lights...walk for a couple of mins and you\'re at Macy\'s. \r\nTick Tock Dinner is to the right of the hotel as you\'re walking out, nice place, we had a $5 tip added on at the end of the bill. Another great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner is The Stage Door, again to the right of the hotel, cross the road. Great menu and reasonable prices, good service.\r\nI would also recommend a cafe on 672 Eighth Avenue, cheap, and the food is very fresh and prepared in front of you. Come out of the hotel, cross the road, turn left and walk for about 7/8 mins.\r\nThe hotel does not charge to the room. \r\nThe hotel bar is pricey!!!!!!!! But does play good 80\'s music.\r\nCheck out - it might be worth checking with the company you\'ve booked the hotel with to see if the price you\'re paying includes local taxes. Our final bill had a total of 13\% added per night on top of our bill. If you have time to kill before your flight, you can leave your luggage with the hotel for a charge of 50c per case/bag, and the same charge when collecting your case/bag. The hotel taxi to the airport is around $70, would recommend pulling a taxi off the street for the flat rate of $45.\r\nOverall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.'
4,'Very Good Hotel','My wife and I stayed here the first weekend in January and it is our third time in this hotel. Overall this is a very good hotel and I had no problem with room or hallway noise. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms were pretty big by NYC standards.\r\nAt check in I tried to use the self-check in machine and that did not work, but the young lady at the front desk checked me in quickly.\r\nYou can nit pick about some little things about this hotel, but its not really worth it. Overall its a great location and nice place to stay.\r\nKeep in mind I am not a business traveler.'
4,'Fabulous service, Perfect location, Very good room!','The location is ideal. The desk staff, the bellmen and the parking staff were courteous, patient and very helpful.'
5,'Great place to stay','Had concerns after reading some negative reviews, but shouldn\'t have worried. Room was on 22nd floor away from elevators, it was quiet, spacious for a city hotel and clean. Didn\'t have coffee facilities in room but reception gave us vouchers to use in Starbucks. Location couldn\'t have been better, walking distance to most places. Thanks Hilton.'
4,'Perfect hotel for those on a budget','Decent rooms, decent service and a real New York experience throughout! This is a great place to stay if you\'re looking for a hotel that gas a great location in downtown manhattan: just a ten-minutes-walk to times square! I agree - the rooms are a bit shabby - but they\'re OK in accordance with the room rates.'
4,'Great location and extremely comfortable','When we arrived we were allocated a room on the 19th floor. The shower dripped all night, the air con was broken and we could not open the curtains. When we complained the next morning we were given a smaller (although very noisy) room on the 7th floor which was clean and comfortable. Staff on reception were a delight and the hotel manager gave me half my internet rental back because it went down for a day which was very generous. The location is amazing and a good choice for all the attractions once you learn how the subway and busses work. If we returned to New York we would certainly consider staying here again. A fantastic week exploring New York and Macy\'s (round the corner) has loads of bargains.'
3,'Convenient location - Improved since last visit','Last time I stayed I would have rated one star due to awful service & terrible housekeeping. But company & location had me there again. This time was better. Very clean & service was fine. Location is convenient - for me that is biggest draw. I was upgraded to a recently remodeled room - which for the most part was quite nice. Paint in bathroom was peeling though. Huge hotel & busy/crowded. Overall, its an ok place to stay.'
4,'Best Times Square Location','I have stayed at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square on several occasions for leisure and will definitely go back.\r\nThis location is perfect! It\'s central to sight-seeing, Broadway shows, shopping etc. The service, rooms and quality are what you would expect from a Marriott. The rooms are spacious for Times Square. The rates can be high depending on the time of year, but that\'s what I expect for this location. The only complaint I have, is that the elevators can become quite crowded and cause you to wait in the evenings. Again, this is to be expected in a hotel with over 1,000 rooms.\r\nThis is an area filled with tourists so if you\'re looking for quiet and to avoid crowds this would not be the hotel for you. If you want to be in the center of everything, this location is ideal!'
3,'Needs big time renovation. Very...','Needs big time renovation. Very disappointing stay at Grand Club room. Smelly rooms, tiny bath rooms, outdated lounge set up. Said renovations are coming next year. Can\'t come soon enough. Should\'ve stayed at the Starwoods.'
4,'great location','my wife and i stayed at the Edison sept 10-15 2012. Had a few concerns having read some negative feedback on the hotel but we needn\'t have worried. Yes the rooms are on the small side , as is the bathroom but this is Times square where space is at a premium. We have previously stayed in the Paramount on Times square and the Edison knocks spots off that , we have also stayed at the Doubletree on Lexington which is nice and the roms are much bigger but i felt we were too far out , there were no bars near and we were having to pay for taxi\'s all the while . On a city break all my wife and i look for is a nice clean hotel , clean bedding and fresh towels in a great location as we only use it as a base for a pit stop and to sleep - and the Edison meets all these requirements , so if you are like minded have no worries if you\'ve booked or about to .'
4,'Enjoyable Stay','We enjoyed our stay here. Room was very clean when we arrived. Cleaning lady was very nice. Able to check in early (around 12:45pm instead of 3pm). Rooms were small (New York!) Biggest problem was no storage in bathroom, though there is a little shelf over the toilet which helped. Bathroom was clean, though, so I was happy. The hotel is old, but well taken care of. I\'d stay again. Oh, and one block from Penn Station--very easy access to Subway & Amtrak.'
3,'Mycket bra rum men sådär med hiss, restaurang och frukostavgift','Besökte staden första veckan i juli månad. Rummet var mycket fint, stort och rent uppe på 30 våningen. Vi betalde lite extra för att få med en soffa i rummet. Bad om ett rum med utsikt vilket vi fick, lite mot Hudson River och intilliggande kvarter. Trodde vi hade bokat frukost i priset men det visade sig att det hade vi inte. Hade tänkt pröva frukosten på hotellet men den kostade 35 dollar pp vilket innebär att det var dyrare att äta på hotellet än på diner. En kväll tänkte vi mysa till det lite extra och besöka hotellets restaurang och det blev en oerhörd besvikelse. Det finaste de hade förutom fisk var pasta carbonara. Hovmästaren hade en attityd av att servera den finaste måltiden i staden. Vi beställde in både vanligt och kolsyrat vatten och fick in två hellitrar på två personer, vilket givetvis var alldeles för mycket! Halva första veckan fungerade bara två hissar av tre så vi kunde få vänta mellan 5-10 minuter på att komma ner alternativt åka upp till vårt våningsplan.'
5,'Great location','The hotel was a perfect location for our visit to New York. The room was on the small side but clean and tidy. We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the city. The staff were all pleasant and helpfull. We only really returned to it at night and were so tired fell into the comfy bed and woke up the following day refreshed and ready to go again. There were vending machines on our floor, cold drinks, ice and crisps. Didn\'t find a coffee machine. Nothing in room to make your own either.\r\nWe bought the metro card at the near buy 34th st subway and best buy. We must have used it 3 or 4 times a day for the E train, Up town or Down town so simple. Got within walking distance of ever sight.\r\nWould look to stay there again on our next visit.'
3,Excelente!!,'Es un hotel que por su ubicación tenía un precio excelente. Enfrente del Carnegie Hall, desde la entrada se ve Time Square, al lado tiene un Starbucks, dos cuadras de Central Park. Entrada del subre en la entrada lateral. La habitación que nos otorgaron tenia buena vista, tranquila, sin ruidos, limpia y super amplia. La falla? no tenía frigobar, pero es una nimiedad.'
4,'Excellent Location','Stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights. Hotel is in an excellent location - across the street from Maddison Square Garden, 15 mins walk from Times Square, 5 mins walk to Macys and 10 mins walk to the Empire State building.\r\nThe hotel foyer is grand and impressive. Front desk staff were extremely polite and helpful and efficient. Our room (renovated Metro room) was on the small side but beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean - the maid came every day to change linens and tidy up. Room size really did not matter to us as we wanted to see the city, not sit in our room all day! The hotel lifts are quick, despite there being so many rooms in the hotel. My only critisism is that tea and coffee making facilities have to be requested, something which I feel should be standard for the cost per night.\r\nTick Tock Diner, attached to the hotel, is a little on the expensive side (especially for breakfast) but the service was quick. There is a TGI Fridays and a 24hr McDonalds accross the street and various other eateries along Eighth Avenue. There is plenty to see and do in NY, I would recommed the Gray Line Downtown bus tour (red buses) to familiarise yourself with the city, and see the sights. Just be aware that you are required to tip for EVERYTHING, usually between 15-20\%, and restaurant prices are exclusive of tax. Look out for the freebies, especially the ferrys which are free and give great views of the Statue of Liberty, plus on certain days some museums are pay by donation, rather than the usual standard price. Yellow cabs from JFK cost a standard $45 plus tolls (around $5), make sure you dont get in a gypsy taxi, there is an official taxi rank at each terminal in the airport.'
5,'Great service','Just wanted to say thanks for a great weekend Oct 20/21st.\r\nMany thanks to Sandra Esp for her great custmer service. \r\nMy wife and I greatly appreciate the getaway in Time Square, so much to do in only a weekend. Crown Plaza is right in the heart of it.'
5,'Outstanding Hotel and best choice for staying in Times Square','My family and I recently stayed at he Marriott Marquis in Times Square New York. It was the best service I have received in a very long time. We were taking tours kid to NY for the very first time. My wife and I had been there before but this was the first trip for the kids. I had requested in advance a complimentary upgrade(if possible) since we were very close to celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. I also mentioned in my email that this was a family trip and we would appreciate any assistance since we wanted to make this trip extra special for the kids. I arrived first since I was coming directly from a business meeting. Upon arrival I noticed we had been upgraded to a center view room. Our view from our room of Times Square was just outstanding. Shortly after arriving I heard a knock at my door and was shocked to see a large table with an iced champagne bottle, 2 glasses, several bottles of different kinds of juices for the kids, a box of imported chocolates, a basket of snacks for the kids and a nice \'welcome to our hotel card from management. I\'m already a Marriott client and I often stay at Marriott for my business trip but this was beyond what I expected. The hotel management also provided us with concierge lounge access which was very useful. I\'m so impressed with the management there and this type of service and is the reason I keep coming back to Marriott. The NY Marriott Marquis was extra special. The hotel is centrally located as well. Nice clean rooms, attentive staff and they have the best workout room I\'ve found in any hotel. While I\'ve enjoyed great service at most Marriotts this was by far the best and the most attentive. It\'s so nice when you plan a trip and don\'t regret your choice of hotels. Thanks again to the NY Marriott Marquis management. You\'ve done well and have earned my loyalty.'
4,'Buen Hotel y magnifica situacion','Es un Hotel bastante nuevo, muy funcional. La situacion a un minuto de Time Square, sin el problema del ruido. El personal atento poco visible, no es una critica. Algo que no me gusta es en que muchas de sus habitaciones no se pueden abrir las ventanas, en otras se puede lo justo para ventilar la habitacion y es muy agradable. Cierto es que esto es cada vez mas frecuente en los Hoteles de nueva construccion.'
5,'Excelente Opcion','Queres ir a un hotel y gastar relativamente menos del promedio de lo que se paga por dormir en Manhattan? Esta es tu correcta eleccion. Excelente ubicacion frente a Penn Station y Madison Square Garden, a pocas cuadras de Times Square y del Empire State. \r\nLo malo? Lento check in, y nulo servicio.... Pero con la adrenalina de llegar y salir a recorrer, quien piensa en eso? \r\nHabitaciones limpias, con lo justo para pasar una buena noche, muy buena ducha.'
1,'Terrible is not enough...','Wish there was a lower score. Terrible does not start to describe this hotel and service. It is a very old hotel and very bad facilities. Like the manager describes the building as barely standing. Front desk manager nice. Natasha, on the other hand, the ruddest vulgar person I have ever come accross in this industry, and yes, she is assigned to the front desk. The first impression bad. The rest even worse. We are well traveled people and not necesarilly demanding, but when the toilet overflows, air conditioners dont work, and carpets are soaking wet due to old air conditioners leaking you do complain. Yes, all in diffrent rooms. We were changed from room to room 4 times. Practically ruined our first day of vacation (and we don\'t have many). It is cheap, butbthat is no excuse for the bad conditions and certainly not an excuse for mean service. Simply they don\'t care at all about the customer being satisfied.'
4,'Nice well furnished hotel','We spend two nights here and were very pleased. The service was great and the rooms were very clean and inviting. The Don Shula restaurant downstairs was also first rate.'
4,'Great location and nice rooms','I recently stayed at this hotel in early May and it was a great experience. The hotel staff was very nice, the rooms were very clean and the location was really central. I won\'t hesitate in staying here again.'
4,'For NY, it\'s fine!','Nothing fancy about this hotel. There seemed to be a lot of tour groups booked at the hotel. The lobby decor is chic/modern, but it doesn\'t really work. The interior is a bit worn. But....for affordable midtown Manhattan it was just fine. We stayed for 5 nights at the hotel. Our room was very clean and spotlessly maintained each day. The staff is friendly - especially the housekeeping staff. The bed was incredibly comfortable!! The size was generous for NY - we have paid much more for smaller rooms. The location was great - a few blocks from Times Square and the theatre district; Central Park was just around the corner. I noticed other reviews mentioned the elevators - we thought they were fine, especially for a hotel with over 25 floors. The only thing that bugged me was the $14.10 charge per 24 hours of internet service; most tourists these days rely on the internet for planning and booking. Overall, I can recommend this hotel without reservation.'
4,'Perfect tourist location','My wife and I stayed for 5 nights from 19 May to 23 May. This was our second time stayijng at this hotel, the first being about 5 years ago. We will probably use the hotel on our next trip to New York - assuming the TripAdvisor reports comtinue to be favorable!. The location is perfect for tourists, theatre-goers, and shoppers. Rooms are quite spacious and bright with large windows. Housekeeping and overall customer service are very good. We paid $100 extra [ 4 hours x $25/hour] for a 6:00PM checkout which was worth the money given our late departure from JFK. Opted for the bed & breakfast special and glad we did. For breakfast, you can go out to local eateries or bring someting in from a deli, but the hotel\'s buffet selection, quality and convenience was wortth the sligt added cost. This time we had a 15 room overlooking Broadway. Prevouslsy, we had a 12 room facing west to the Hudson. The former will give you the excitemet of Brodway, the latter will give you some respite from the noise - particularly on weekends.'
4,'Great location.','Great location. Rooms decent size for New York. Elevators slow but that\'s the only complaint. Good gym for a hotel. Hotel check in on the 8th floor which is a little weird. Rooms clean and pretty quiet considering you\'re on top of Times Square.'
3,'Not Impressed','Central location is great, the rooms are a fair size. The staff is friendly, for the most part, and the restaurant was excellent, if expensive.\r\nI did miss having a fridge or microwave in the room, as are in most hotels of this size and stature. The elevators are on a confusing system, having to program your floor number at a remotely located console. After we figured out the system, hardly a use went by without our having to instruct someone of the way to call an elevator, as you cannot just press a button in the elevator to get to your selected floor. Most confusing. \r\nAll of that pales however in the light of one happening. We hung the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and the maid saw fit to enter in spite of that fact. I don\'t completely blame her though. The signs are a murky color and hang in a rather unobtrusive manner on the handle of the door. However. Do Not Disturb means just that. I felt very unhappy with the room after that point, and except for the fact the room was paid in advance, as demanded by the management, I would have left. \r\nAnother black mark from my perspective was the in-room safe size. It was barely large enough to fit a compact Ultra Book into it. In fact it had to be put in at an uncomfortable angle, that plus it is only a bout 18 inches off of the ground! Quite awkward.\r\nAll in all, I would not return to this hotel, nor recommend it to friends.'
5,'Grand old hotel, shambolic lifts','What a lobby - the first thing you see when you walk in is the double or triple height ornate lobby. The second thing you will notice is just how busy this place can get, queues to check in can be long at peak times, helps if you have Hilton Honors status. \r\nThere is clearly a program of renovation going on as there are varying levels of decor on different floors, the floor i was on felt in need of a freshen up, the colours and patterns were not very modern, yet my colleagues on a different floor hadf a far more modern fresher feel.\r\nThe lifts are crazy, there are 9 or 10 in total to the general floors, but are grouped in 3\'s to various floors, waiting times of 5 minutes and more are not uncommon.\r\nThe bar and restaurant offering are great, Potters is a dark bar, but feels like a bar should. In the lobby the Lockwood bar seems a little more sophisticated. One thing that was great in my opinion is the choice of beers available, from internationally recognised brands to local craft beers. The Goose Island Honkers Ale is a particular favorite of mine.\r\nBreakfast is served in Lockwoods restaurant from 6:30 every morning, the a la carte choice is good but the hot and cold buffet is equally good. The continental choice is not particularly varied, I thought the British idea of a continental breakfast was bad!\r\nThe location is great for bars and restaurants, plenty within a few blocks, the Hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the main shopping area on Michigan Avenue.'

4,'Best Location in Town!','There seemed to be mixed reviews for this one but in New York all we wanted was somewhere to get our head down at night. From maps & descriptions I knew the hotel was near to Times Square; I didn\'t realise it\'s street was on Times Square! It was fabulous! Considering our location we didn\'t get as much noise as expected - a couple of nights there were a few horns & screeching but didn\'t last all night. It is so easy staying in Times Square - lots of tacky souvenir shopping which let\'s face it, we all have to do a bit of! Teeming with cafes, bars & restaurants, plus it\'s the best place to get around from (& perhaps more importantly, back to!) - whether you\'re walking (fairly central for uptown & downtown) and nearly all the buses and all the subway go to or via Times Square! The hotel itself is a bit old fashioned - art deco style - not my taste and the furniture could do with updating in the rooms but it was clean and spacious - there were 2 adults & 2 teens in our room with 2 double beds & there was still enough room to move about. We didn\'t have a safe in our room but there is free safety deposit at reception available 24/7 which we made good use of - at all times of the day. We didn\'t eat in the hotel but some of our group tried breakfast and weren\'t too impressed but it didn\'t matter as there was a tasty deli next door but one to the hotel and a few more steps & you were spoilt for choice! With all the shopping in the area you probably wouldn\'t bother with the hotel shop - but do have a look - it was actually pretty reasonable & I got a couple of things in there cheaper than in nearby shops! We stayed 4 nights which I think is the minimum you should have for New York, especially if you\'ve not been before (we\'d been once before but still filled our time) - most tour operators seem to offer a 3 night package but that\'s hard going, I\'d really recommend an extra one or 2 nights to really get the best from your trip! Would I go again? Yes & without a doubt I\'d stay at the Edison!'
4,'Una bella sorpresa!','Il Palmer ci è stato consigliato dal Tour Operator per la sua posizione centrale ed è vero, è a metà strada tra il lago ed il centro, proprio all\'interno del Loop ed abbiamo usato la macchina solo per spostarci la sera... La hall è spettacolare e la camera era accogliente, grande e pulita. Attenzione al parcheggio: chiedono 51$ al giorno!'
1,'It should be burned to the ground','Most of the reviews were correct...this had to be the dirtiest hotel in the United States! The bathrooms were old, out-dated, dirty and just down-right disgusting. If you just want a place to lay down, cross the street and stay at Penn Station...it\'s cleaner.'
4,'Good one..','This hotel was good, we liked the room and the location. We reserved the room from a bidding website, so the price was ok.\r\nHowever, we had a big stroller for my son, they only have a going up escalator to go to the lobby and elevators. They were making renovations and the elevators doesn\'t go down to the street level, and apparently the staff there didn\'t know about that!\r\nWe had to carry the stroller down the stairs when we wanted to go out!!!'
2,'Great location but in need of TLC','We were very worried having read the reviews of this hotel but really couldn\'t afford anything cheaper in this location! The location is FANTASTIC, but is really the only positive thing that can be said about this hotel. We followed the advice and asked for a renovated room, only to be told that the last renovation happened six years ago. The first room we were shown had two single beds squeezed into a tiny room. There were five different shades of mould throughout the room and so we asked to move. The room we ended up with was larger, with double beds, but the bathroom was still not great with rust and holes in the walls. There was also mould under the heater and around the window, but nothing as bad as the first room. The other problem was that we were sharing the hotel with a large school party. A lot of sleep was lost due to sharing a corridor with largely unsupervised, drunk teenagers! Also be aware that the \'Lindy\'s\' restaurant in the hotel charges $4 for a cup of tea. A better bet is \'City Perk\' in the lobby which only charges £1.50.'
3,'Doesn\'t live up to Hyatt name','I stayed here for business 2 nights and have 2 major complaints:\r\n- the walls are paper thin, I could hear people in the next room very clearly\r\n- the rooms are nice sized however the bathrooms were of 2 star quality! Very outdated and poorly lite, with very little amenities. The shower curtain looked years old and grimy. \r\nI got the hotel at a discounted corporate rate but would not justify the full price if I had to stay there again. I think I just expected more from the Hyatt name.'
4,'Great location','Great manager made the stay much better. The rooms are fine - but the location is king! Push for an upgrade as the average room is just for sleeping & no bath if that is important. I liked the free coffee or water in the great store off the lobby. I would stay again or try for the Andaz.'
1,'Kann ich nicht weiterempfehlen','Lage perfekt. \r\nDirekt in Midtown\r\nZu Fuss fast alles zu erreichen\r\nHotel an sich nicht mal 2** Wert\r\nAlt, Hygiene fraglich\r\nGibt wohl zwei verschiede Hotels in einem. Eines soll wohl gut sein hören/sagen -> Penn 5000\r\nFazit:\r\nObwohl das Hotel mit einer der besten Lage in New York hat gegen ueber com Madison Square Garden ist es das Geld auf garkeinen Fall Wert. \r\nMan bekommt fuer weniger Geld mehr Comfort und Luxus in New York.\r\nFuer die jenigen, welche nach New York mochten und eventuel ueber dieses Hotel stolpern, kann ich nur sagen finger weg. Man kann sich den schoene Urlaub in New York durch dieses Hotel kaputt machen'
2,'estrategica ubicacion, mediocre hotel','El hotel esta super bien ubicado, creo que es lo unico que justifica pagar lo que vale.\r\nes muy antiguo, y el mantenimiento no existe.\r\nen cuanto a servicios, podrian brindar wifi, ya que usar internet cargando tarjeta es patetico y la atencion de los empleados, de terror, imposible preguntar algo y que lo respondieran con buena onda.'
4,'GREAT location..!','Despite the hotel\'s imperfections, it is worth the stay just for its superb location! It is located directly acroos the road to Penn Station which is one of the main train stations in New York. It is also directly across from Maddison Square Garden, and within walking distance to alot of other main attractions. If you walk down the end of the street you will hit Times Square!\r\nWe were pretty sceptical about staying here at first especially after reading some of the average reviews, but I think the good out weighs the bad. Yes it is a little old fashioned, and the rooms are quite small, but lets face it your there to see New York City not sit in your hotel room complaining about the out-dated furnishings!'
3,'In posizione strategica','Hotel in posizione privilegiata nel cuore di Manhattan, su Times Square.\r\nI cataloghi sono forse un pò troppo bonari verso questa struttura, di buoni servizi e livello ma non di lusso. Le stanze sono molto spaziose e confortevoli. Certo non ricomprendere la colazione di default non pare una buona mossa, tenendo conto che andando al bar interno alla carta il servizio è lento e prestato da persone che se la cavano così così con l\'inglese.\r\nAlla receiption grande cortesia. Viste mozzafiato sulla grande mela!'

3,'muy buen hotel para visitar la ciudad','Hemos estado 7 noches en este hotel y para lo que nos esperábamos, venimos contentos.\r\nBuscabamos un hotel bien situado y lo encontramos.Está en una zona que siempre está llena de gente, muchisimas tiendas, sitios para comer, paradas de metro, justo en frente tiene un mc donals 24 horas, pizzeria, una pharmacy...muy cerca del empire, de time square...\r\nEl hotel es muy grande tiene unas 40 plantas.Nosotros estábamos en la 21, en una habitacion que daba a una calle tranquila sin mucho ruido, aunque las hay con vistas al empire, madison square garden...y si estas en una planta alta, las vistas deben ser impresionantes!!\r\nEl hotel es antiguo, pero está muy reformado. Nuestra habitacion era muy pequeña, con una cama de matrimonio comodisima!!! que despues de estar todo el dia pateando la ciudad se agradece muchisimo!! el baño viejo pero algo renovado y muy limpio, todos los dias nos reponian geles, toallas...\r\nComo negativo, en recepcion no nos trataron demasiado bien, podian haber sido mas amables .No nos hablaban en español, ni intentaban ayudarnos un poco para entendernos...con lo grande que es el hotel y la de gente trabajando que tiene seguro que alguien nos podia haber atendido...\r\nComo conclusion, no es un palacio pero si buscas un sitio centrico cerca de todo y una cama cómoda, es una buena elección!!!'
1,'Why does NYC allow this','I was given trip to Westminster Dog Show in NYC. Because the hotel is across from MSG, we thought this was the hotel to go to to view the dogs & owners. That assumption was correct however after checking in ,we immediately checked out! We were told rooms on 11th&12th floors we their best. Wow ! The rooms were so outdated,dark, dirty downright scary. Carpeting was dark brown,looked 40years old, no padding,wouldn\'t dare walk barefoot. Bedspreads pillows and linens were old with holes in blankets,they too appeared to be 40years old. The bathrooms were antiquated with leaking faucets in both rooms that were offered to us. I can not believe that the city of NewYork as well as the owners of MSG allow such deplorable conditions to be offered to the numerous visitors that come to their city. I hope a revamp of entire building is in the immediate future.'
5,'We loved it','Had a great time at this hotel. The desk staff were very helpful, courteous and cheerful at all times. On checking in we asked for a room with a view and were given a room with view of Empire State Building at no extra charge. Although the standard room was small, it had everything we needed. Our room was cleaned daily to a high standard. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York on a budget.'
5,'First visit to New York','Couldn\'t fault the Crowne Plaza, Location, service and amenities excellent. Had a luxourious king room on the 33 floor, overlooking Broadway and over to the East River. Ten minute walk to Empire State, Rockefeller Centre, central theatres and the Magnolia Bakery, (fabulous!).\r\nForget the subway, it\'s unfathomable. Just walk or get a taxi.\r\nBeware the guys at the airport telling you they run a hotel shuttle, which they make out to be free to get you to the parking lot. They don\'t and it isn\'t. They have stretch limos and are making money on the side. Get a taxi, ($58 inc. tolls), or the train, ($20).\r\nDo the Statten Island ferry from Battery Park. It\'s free and you get fabulous views of Manhatten and the Statue of Liberty.'
4,'Very Good, well located and renewed','I use to go to this hotel for business when traveling to NYC. After the recent renewal process, the hotel is much more comfortable, the lobby is nice, rooms are comfortable and the beds are very good, especially the variety of pillows. Among observations I can say that some times it may be very expensive, but if you reserve in advance you may get good rates for the quality you receive. Other observation is that the bathrooms have room for improvement, since they are small and you hardly find a place to put your stuff. The little shop at lobby level works 24 h and you may get drinks or something light to eat at any time. Staff is friendly and make efforts to provide good service'
5,'Quiero viviiir alliii','Me encanto, desayuno a lo bestia, de todo, mucha variedad.\r\nCamas super pomposas, comodísimas, habitaciones impecables, en todo el corazon de manhattan.\r\nUn cosa a tener en cuenta, nos quisieron sisar, cuando ya nos ibamos, quisieron cobrarnos por ver la tv en un canal que decir que era de pago, pero...es curioso, por que en la semana que estuvimos no tuvimos tiempo de ver tv.'
5,'Très bon hôtel, très bien situė','Nous avons passé 6 jours à NYC et nous recommandons cet hôtel. Très bien situé, très bon petit déjeuner, chambre spacieuse et propre et magnifique vue sur Time Square.'
4,'all\'Hilton new York mi sono trovato bene','all’Hilton New York (Ave. of the Americas) ho avuto una bella stanza, modernamente arredata, sebbene con il bagno piccolo. Il personale molto gentile e disponibile. La posizione ottima. Subway vicino. Il MoMA di fronte, a due passi dal Rockefeller Center e vicino a Times Sq. Il prezzo un po\' alto. Nota negativa: l\'ultimo giorno, dal momento che dovevamo liberare la stanza entro le 12 e il nostro aereo partiva in serata, ci hanno chiesto 3,5$ a collo per tenere in deposito le nostre valigie.'
4,'\%.','Booked online through their website and was able to book at 30\% less than our travel agent. The person checkfing us in went to great lengths to get us an outside room (one with windows)and had no problem checking us in even though we were 2 hours early . \r\nThe room was larger than expected and seemed pretty clean. The only thing I noticed as strange was the windows in the shower/tub, but they were completely frosted for privacy so no complaint there. All the staff we encountered were polite and helpful. Did think that $14.95/day for internet access was a little extreme, and after seeing the room service prices decided to make the effort to find meals elsewhere. But overall a very pleasant experience. Would definately stay there again. The location was close to all our points of interest, and the subway stop is just outside the hotel.'
1,'Beware of Bugs','Beware of bugs! Upon returning to our room after the Yankee game in the evening I saw a bug climbing up a pillow on the bed. Upon further investigation, I found 4 more on the bedspread, one on the desk, one on the wall and one on the ceiling. When I lifted up the mattress to see if any were under it, I found a porn mag (but no more bugs). After calling down to the front desk and waiting 15 minutes for someone to come to the room, we called down again. They told us we needed to pack up our belongings and head down to the front desk. When we got there, we were greeted doubtfully, but were given keys to a new room. We hopped in the elevator, and rode up to another room only to find more bugs (different variety) taking up residence along the baseboards. When the front desk was called, they informed us that they weren\'t sure if they had another room and we needed to come down to the front desk again! We loaded up our luggage again and I brought a few of the bugs I\'d killed with a used metrocard as proof down to the front desk. This time the only response the front desk could muster was That\'s funny. I They did manage to find us a THIRD room. Despite not having much interest in continuing our stay at this point, we had nowhere else to go. We spent the next hour going through our clothes to make certain there were no stowaways and trying to rid ourselves of that skin is crawling feeling and finally got to bed. \r\nThe good news is that this room appears to be bug free. (I\'m writing this from the hotel room without bugs). Beware if you choose to stay here. The location is great but the unwanted roommates are not.'
4,'Great location','Stay at this hotel for the location. You can get into Grand Central Station without even going outside. Centrally located so you can get uptown or downtown easily. Within walking distance of many attractions. After seeing reviews about the small bathrooms we were expecting the worst but it seemed adequate to us. The vanity was useless and I can\'t imagine how many things have fallen into the toilet that is situated directly under a shelf. But, our room was clean and for New York standards adequately sized with a small sofa and table. Staff was very friendly. Decor is not my taste - modern and trendy but probably appeals to many others.'
5,Great,'I have just been reading some bad reviews about this hotel and Im unsure why. Me and the better half nooked this hotel through Expedia, this being our 5th stay in NYC. \r\nThis was by far the best hotel we have stayed in. We got there at 1pm when check in wasnt until 3 and I asked the check in lady if we could have a room with a view. We were told that the room class we booked didnt have a view but she would see what they could do. She came back and told us we could have a free upgrade with a nice view. \r\nOn getting to the room, it was large with blown heating (the previous hotels I have stayed in in NY has been the steam type that bang all night), a clean bathroom and bedroom, a flat panel TV with HD and many film channels. The pillows and mattress were very comfy. Wehn we looked out the window we could see the top of the Empire State building and Madison Square Garden (complete with what seemed to be most of NYPD\'s finest) right out the window. Perfect. In all fairness, if we didnt have a view, would it matter??. We go there to see New York, not sit in the room and read.\r\nOn checking out we left our bags with a bell boy for $3 at 11am and returned at 6 to collect them. The only reason why I put a 3 for service is the luggage was the only service we needed. We will definately go back.'
3,'great location','stayed here on dec 4 2011 the rooms are very small.we stayed for one night so it was not bad for one night at 300.00 a night.the hotel in around the block from central park and 9th ave that has great bars and all kinds of places to grab a bite to eat.the bar in the hotel is the spot to start the night they make all kinds of wonderful drinks,and this will get you ready for the nyc have a good time'
5,'A good choice','A safe, comfortable, and decent hotel in a good location for down or uptown. I was there for over a week to take advantage of travelling on the trains at the nearby penn station, but would certainly stay here again as a good base for the city. Staff were excellent, and my one bed apartment room on the 26th floor was lovely with a very comfortable bed. I thought the bathrooms were perfectly adequate in size, compact but clean with a decent shower head and mirrors. I travel alot with business and couldn\'t have hoped for a better deal. Sure there is noise in the streets below, but it\'s all part of the new york experience.'
5,'Great Visit','This was a very nice hotel. Our room was huge. Went to Starbucks in lower level every monring. Not much to offer on food but had a nice bar. Shula\'s is there but did not was the typical food. Yes I would stay again. Went at Christmas time and it was beautiful.'
3,'Style over comfort','Great lobby but standrard room is extremely small, cools style but not comfortable. Not suited for business traveler; no easy outlet for laptop, desk is tiny, no comforable chair, metal desk chair is the only chair in the room'
5,'New Yorker','We booked this hotel through our local Thomson travel agent to celebrate two family birthdays. \r\nWe booked the hotels transportation service through their website which was very easy to do for a ludite. The driver picked us up from the airport and gave us a quick tour of New Jersey and New York which was excellent (all for $90).\r\nI found the staff during check in to be excellent and good humoured.\r\nThe room was very clean and tidy, in keeping with the rest of the hotel and we were lucky enough to have a room with a fanatastic view of the Empire state and Chrysler Buildings, we slept with the blinds open as we couldn\'t believe how great the view was.\r\nWe ate breakfast in the tick tock diner which was reasonably priced.\r\nThe hotel has a good location for the Empire State, Times square and Grand Central station.\r\nThe only negatives were that there was no tea or coffee facilites in the room and there was an art to setting the shower. \r\nI cannot thank the Hotel staff enough for making our third stay in New York so memorable, we will return and soon.'
4,'Great Stay','The rooms are so spacious. Beds are super comfy. Room service was timely. Location is superb. Gym was large. Totally recommend this place.'
3,'Great location, missing some amenities','We couldn\'t have asked for a better location - central to anything you want to walk to: theatre, great restaurants, shopping and sites. The hotel is clean and the staff fairly friendly, but there is no mini fridge in the room which means you can take a doggy bag home from that fabulous restaurant or store medications that need refrigeration. WiFi is not free in the rooms - why? And there\'s a charge to use the in-room safe...really? Who charges for a safe????? Still, the beds were comfy and quiet. The constant noise from Times Square could not be heard in the room.'
2,'So in need of a renovation!','Ok so i have stayed at this hotel a couple of times. The main reason not being that i like it but because its close to the Penn station and where i have business mettings. On 28th.\r\nAnyway i have stayed in the regular rooms and the so called 500 Penn rooms that sound like they are special. Both rooms had old faucets and the air conditioning was bad. The regular rooms have bathrooms that i have to use a plastic bag to stand over because im afraid of what i will get. The celling on all the bathrooms in the regular rooms are pealing! above the tub area. the 500 Penn rooms are a bit better. If you have not gone to say westins before u will not be so discusted as i am. But even a young traveler will notice this hotel needs a make over. Did i mention that one time house keeping came to my room at 11:30 at nite? yes they did! usually you dont get them to your room till 3-4 p.m. Even down stairs at the loby if you look up you will see that the borders and that the celling need a remodeling fast you can see wires all over this place. And god forbit you get any help in this hotel in less than a hour.'
1,'Very Uncomfortable Rooms !','Don\'t waste your time if looking for comfort.\r\nWhat were they thinking with the Bathroom design\r\nDark and Tiny rooms, will never, ever go back!'
3,'First and Last stay but great location','The location is great. It is across the street from Madison Sq Garden, Penn Station and a few blocks from Times Sq. It\'s prime location for a cheap price but the service is less than stellar. Some of the staff act as if you are bothering them with questions although it\'s their job. The hotel is old and needs remolding badly. They offer broadcast channels but not one free premium channel. We bascially use the room to change and sleep it was too dreary to lounge about.'
3,'Look a mouse!!!','Had tickets to a concert at MSG this past Friday so we decided to stay at The New Yorker. The hoter has a GREAT LOCATION and the check in went fast. The rooms and beds are small but hey in New York no? While half the party staying went to the concert the other part stayed at the hotel and found a mouse YES a mouse I said. We were moved to another room but with no help from the bellman to move the luggage. We received comp breakfast at the diner and an hour later check-out which I think was not enough.\r\nYeah so I don\'t think we\'ll be staying again'
4,'Very nice','Clean...location is great.....but why charge $10 to run on the treadmill for 30 minutes?? I\'m sorry but I think it tacky to charge guests to use the exercise room when you are paying over $200 a night.\r\nHowever, the things that needed to be important, were.'
4,'Excellent hotel, exceeded expectations','We stayed at the New Yorker in December 2009. The hotel stood out as a budget priced hotel offering fantastic refurbished rooms in a great location. All of this turned out to be true. Although small, the extremely well refurbished rooms felt more than adequate, with the bed linen being of a good standard. The room and corridors around the hotel were immaculate. Staff were generally helpful and did what they could, although given the size of the hotel you don’t get that personal touch that you do in others. The benefit in staying in a bustling hotel like this is that you really feel you are in New York, there is a great atmosphere. We didn’t eat at the hotel at all, but did have a few drinks in the bar just off the lobby, which was always quite busy. For the money, I would return to this hotel again without a doubt.'
5,'Convenient and Spacious','My husband and I stayed here for one night in December 2011. Because of our gold Starpoints membership we got upgraded to an Atrium Club room, and it was wonderful. The room was incredibly spacious for New York City with a window seat overlooking 42nd St and the always comfortable Westin Heavenly Bed. The location was perfect, particularly since we had tickets for the Broadhurst Theater, a block and a half away. I would definitely return to this hotel if I was planning on a Broadway-focused trip to NY.'
1,'2 star ???','Stayed Saturday night 10/1/05. The entry door lock was broken. The bathroom door did not close. The room had mold on the walls, and the paint was falling off. The shower had the flow of a garden hose. The bed frame was too big for the mattress and was sticking out of the bed enough to scrape your legs. The table lamp switch was broken and it could not be used.'
5,'Le meilleur hôtel à New York, pour ceux qui aiment le chic branché.','Un conseil: téléphonez de l\'aéroport avant d\'arriver. \r\nLes chambres sont disponibles à compter de 15h, mais si on n\'a pas téléphoné avant, on risque d\'attendre.\r\nLa terrasse au 15 ième étage est un atout majeur à cet hôtel.\r\nLes chambres sont très belles (petites, mais quand on ne passe pas la journée à la chambre d\'hôtel, ça va) et très propres.\r\nPas de moquette. Du bois. Des draps de coton fin.\r\nC\'est à une demi-rue du Columbus Circle où il est facile de louer des vélos pour faire le tour de Central Park. Génial.'
4,'One nite at the Palmer','I had a class trip to a convention held at the Palmer House. Despite the fact that I was there for a night, I enjoyed this big hotel and its amenities, all except the wireless, which might not have been a big problem if we weren\'t 3 assigned to one room. I didn\'t give it 5 stars because I was only there for one night, and I didn\'t get to experience everything. The staff however was great and very accommodating and the hotel was luxurious and opulent. The second con was that the roll out bed was very old looking and the bathrooms were tiny, other than that, my stay here was comfortable.'
4,'Godd hotel, but poor staff at the reception','We stayed at Grand Hyatt New York in the beginning of August and everything met our expectations except the staff at the reception that seemed unprepared.\r\nAt our arrival there was some confusion with our rooms, that was resolved afterwards. Unfortunately this took more than two hours. The persons that attend us offered a meal at the restaurant of the hotel, but at the time of the check-out some rooms were billed this same meal that was offered.\r\nOther than this, it\'s a good hotel and it\'s located near of the main attractions of New York.'
2,'Front Desk Staff - nightmare!','Unfortunately my friends and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square, NYC. This was my first time staying at a Crowne Plaza, and I certainly expected more (it is supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The front desk staff needs to attend a lengthy training session that goes through the basics: organizational strategies, room bookings and customer service. They made so many errors including but not limited to: wrong bed assignments, cancelled keys (which involved a huge ordeal with security, almost making us late for a Broadway show), rooms not ready 1 hour after check in and time promised (even though we requested an early checking time) and they even gave our room away to another family!! The family walked in (with their key) while we were in the room. It is a shame that so many problems occurred since I found the hotel in general to be quite lovely (although the ice machine on our floor wasn‘t working). The room with 2 double beds was clean and a good size. The lobby area was comfortable and Leonela at the concierge desk was extremely helpful. The hotel manager gave us breakfast vouchers to help ease the pain of their mishaps, and the food at the buffet was good (however not worth the $25 that it would have cost). Keon, a server at the breakfast restaurant was wonderful and helped to start our day off on the right foot.'
5,'Nice, near everything, we loved it...','very pleasent stay, good stuff, well located, nice rooms, very clean hotel...'
5,'Excellent Service!!','I stayed at the Park Central for two nights and enjoyed breakfast in their restaurant both mornings. The service was excellent. The food came quickly and was piping hot. I was welcomed and seated both mornings by a lovely young woman, Kristen, who was pleasant and professional. This kick started two great days in New York. Would definitely recommend!'
4,'Ottima posizione, hotel un po\' vecchio, ma consigliato','L\'hotel ha una posizione assolutamente invidiabile: sulla 7th Avenue all\'altezza della 33th Street. Questo significa che si trova di fronte al Madison Square Garden, a due isolati dall\'Empire State Building, a 10 minuti di passeggiata da Times Square, ecc... \r\nL\'albergo è enorme, ha circa 1700 camere e la hall sembra una stazione piuttosto che un albergo. Solitamente bisogna fare un po\' di fila per il check-in. La nostra stanza e anche un\'altra che abbiamo visto, era pulita. Lasciano a desiderare gli arredamenti che sono alquanto vecchi, ma comunque funzionavano. Il prezzo che abbiamo pagato è stato abbastanza buono.'
4,'great new york hotel','I stayed here for one night on a 24 hour stop in new york between flights. It was really great. The location was fantastic, right above the subway meaning easy access to the airport and all of town. The hotel has a great new york feel and there are some treats if you like historical things - the original room I was given was next door to one with a plaque saying Nikola Tesla stayed there. The rooms are small but clean and modern (I had a renovated room - the bathroom was still a bit older but still clean) and there was free internet. When I arrived there was a small mistake with my room - it had not been made up so I was given another room and a free breakfast in the restaurant downstairs - which was completely unexpected. I had lovely views from my room of the Manhattan skyline. If I was to come to New York I would stay here again.'
4,'super, but not cheap!','Stayed here Nov\'11. Awesome location, literally steps from everything, and quiet, nice bed, big bathroom, good service although the lobby escalator was shut down once and there were really no signs to get out another exit. Helpful concierge, should be for $400/night! Gotta love Times Square! Went to a bachata class few blocks away, Copacabana salsa club few blocks away, took subway everywhere (Ground Zero, Met museum), Starbucks steps away, love NY!'
4,'Excellent Stay-Great Location','My family and I just stayed at the New Yorker Hotel (DEC22-DEC26) and experienced a wonderful stay surrounded by a helpful and caring staff. Our room was on the 22nd floor. We were in a suite with a beautiful interior and a wrap around balcony that had an awesome view of ESB. The location of the hotel in Midtown made it possible for us to walk or subway anywhere in the city very quickly. The shopping and atmosphere in Midtown was fantastic. Our room was very clean and large enough to handle myself, 3 teens and wife. The bathroom however was not. There is not a lot space or shelving in the bathroom which would have helped. The staff was ready and eager to assist; from the front desk and room cleaning to the bellman, concierge and door man. Tic Toc diner we never went there, Copper\'s tavern 2 thumbs up (only night capped it there). I have read some of these others reviews and I can only say to those people if you can\'t handle NYC don\'t go to NYC.'
4,'Be Young and Fit...','We stayed here on December 30 and 31, 2005 and I thought the elevator issue was just holiday traffic until I read the reviews here.\r\nAt any given time there were at least two elevators out of commission and the others were backed up terribly. \r\nWe used the stairs and escalators all the time to the 11th floor and I don\'t know how the poor porter ever got our bags up and down.\r\nThe elevator problem is a serious issue and really took a bite out of what would otherwise be an incredible hotel.\r\nOur room was spacious and modern, and the bathroom was the same. \r\nThe northward view was priceless and we could see a large portion of Times Square.\r\nWe were smart and returned to the room by 11:50 on December 31st and thus avoided the mayhem on the streets. \r\nThe crowds were bad enough earlier but the NYPD had a pretty good system of limiting the people to certain areas. We had to show our room key to get within the secure area inside 8th Avenue and the hotel admitted only registered guests.\r\nThe service was great and everything else was no doubt 4 star quality. \r\nWe didn\'t use the restaurants or bar and there was only a hint of street noise.'
4,'Ótima localização','Hotel muito bem localizado, a poucas quadras do Central Park, e próximo de vários restaurantes, supermercados e farmácias. Além de metro, próximo dali. Limpeza boa, comida boa. Peca pelo atendimento, profissionais um pouco rudes, inclusive Concierge. E estranhamos o fato de haver frigobar no quarto, mas ficar trancado. Ou seja, voce nao pode fazer compras e deixar bebidas ou frutas na mini geladeira. Para utilizar, voce deve pedir para destrancar e pagar 35 dólares. Também nao há Wi-Fi gratuito nos quartos, apenas no lobby do hotel. Esses pontos porém nao atrapalham a experiência. O hotel é realmente muito bom!'
2,'Imagine the kids who work at Abercrombie having their own hotel.','I have to say, this hotel was quite a disappointment. The housekeeping was lousy (never replacing dirty glasses), every bulb went out in our room over our week\'s stay, the bathroom is very tiny (you have to move aside from the door to open it), and it just felt amateur. If you are staying for more than a weekend, this is not the place.\r\nWe had the feeling as if the cool kids who work at Abercrombie and Fitch decided, in Little Rascals\' fashion, Hey gang, let\'s open a hotel!. If you like the bars (I did like the Library bar very much), stop by, but don\'t stay in the hotel. Not worth it. They should walk down the street to 6 Columbus (where we moved, and loved it) or the Mandarin Oriental to learn some basic Hotel 101.'
4,'Great stay at the Grand Hyatt','Spent a weekend night at the Grand Hyatt New York. This is not the type of hotel we would ordinarily choose, since we prefer smaller, boutique style hotels, but we were traveling with a group and the hotel was chosen by others. Still, we were pleasantly surprised. The staff was very friendly. When we were inadvertently given a smoking room after registering for non-smoking, the front desk clerk upgraded us to a deluxe king on the 25th floor which was really nice. I was prepared for noise after reading the reviews here, but our room was perfectly quiet and the black-out curtains did their job so well that we slept later than usual in the morning. The bedding was super comfortable, and the room was very clean.\r\nThe location on 42nd Street was great. We walked to Times Square, the Theater District, and the shops on 5th Avenue, and it was an easy subway ride from the train station next door to Chinatown for dim sum. The bellhops managed our group\'s luggage with remarkable efficiency, and we ended our short stay with an outrageously expensive but worth-every-penny drink in the 2nd floor bar before pulling out on Sunday afternoon.\r\nIf you like big, busy, glitzy hotels, this would be an excellent choice.'
4,'Massive, Center of Times Square, Crazy Busy, Has Everything!','I\'ve stayed at the Marquis many times. I think it\'s an essential NYC hotel... right in the heart of Times Square. The space-aged glass elevators, great restaurant/bar views and 50-story open atrium make this a world famous hotel worth visiting. That said, the hotel is NOT as business friendly as you would expect. My wifi was barely functioning and caused my work computer to log me off 10 times over three days. Terrible. The busy streets can make it hard to get anywhere outside of Times Square quickly, long taxi lines, people everywhere, etc. The room service and restaurants were OK, not great. Prices are high. I had a $20 cocktail and my basic room was over $400 a night. All-in-all, this is a great tourist hotel, but I cannot suggest it for business unless your meeting is across the street. \r\n*************\r\nTHE PROS:\r\n- Great Times Square Location, feels like the center of everything\r\n- Impressive size, design, views, stores\r\n- 24/7 amenities\r\n- Room size was OK, upgraded (not all rooms are renovated) \r\nTHE CONS:\r\n- Big, long lines, impersonal, slow to get around\r\n- Price: I paid over $400 on a Monday\r\n- Noisy, on 42nd floor-still heard traffic\r\n- Slow, spotty wifi... really? in 2012?\r\nBottom Line: Lots of pros and cons make this a great place for Times Square visits, but not great if your destinations are uptown or downtown. Can be expensive during peak times--not the best value for sure.'
5,'Old World Charm','The Palmer House is in a great central location...within easy walking distance to theater and parks. (Millinneum Park, just 2 blocks) Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, quiet rooms'
1,'nice lobby,bad room.!','very courteous receptionist and nice lobby-,however when the elevator doors opened [4th floor] we saw what appeared to be a scene from a scary movie...old carpeting,dreary walls, dark,deserted hallways and ancient metal doors ...perhaps Rod Serling or Jack Nicholson would pop out of a doorway and complete this experience .!! The room was tiny in comparison to the endless hallways ,with walls needing paint,rusty metal molding and dirty tiles in the bathroom. walking barefoot on the filthy carpet was not an option,although the bed was ok.[no bugs].didn\'t bother with the vintage TV...This being a one-time[never again] overnighter.'
3,'OK For Some.....But Not Me','I would only recommend this hotel to people who actually don\'t plan to spend any time in their room when they come to NYC. If you\'re looking for trendy, stylish, shoebox sized rooms then this is your place. Me, I like to have enough room to spread my arms without hitting the walls and ceiling, or sit on the toilet without having my knees hit the wall of the bathroom, but that\'s just me. Oh, there was also a laughable attempt at a TV in the lone closet (which, funnily enough, was able to fit a small mini-bar).\r\nTo the hotel\'s credit, the rooms were clean and there was a nice woman at the front desk who switched my room when I discovered my first one had a broken toilet and also printed out my boarding passes. It was also pretty close to Times Square so if you were there to do some sightseeing it would be a good location.\r\nI was staying here on a business trip so I didn\'t really have much choice as my employer picked this place out, but in the future I would probably stay elsewhere. Apparently this is one of the trendiest new nightspots in the city so if you\' re looking for a hotel with a good nightclub this is your place.'
3,'Good location- Dated Rooms','I stay in NYC hotels frequently on business and have stayed in 3 hotels in this vicinity of Ave of the Americas and 52 St, the other hotels being the Sheraton and The Michelangelo. They are all similar in price and all convenient to business in this area, but also convenient to Times Square, Broadway, 5th Ave. and Central Park.\r\nThe Hilton has more business travelers and fewer of the tourists and high school bus trips that I encountered in the Sheraton. So I give the Hilton a plus in that department.\r\nTwo things were negative for me at the Hilton. First, the rooms that I was in on two seperate stays are quite old. The bedspreads and all that was new, but the bathrooms are old. Everything from the height of the ceiling to the showerhead to the fixtures is dated. It all functions, but for $450 a night I expect better.\r\nSecond thing that was a negative is the attitude of the employees in the Hilton Honors sections of the hotel. To access the Executive Lounge you need to give the monitor at the door your room key. The attitude from this person is they are somewhat inconvenienced by your presence. Then one morning I came into the Lounge to use the computers and one was not working. I asked the monitor for help and she again had a bad attitude. I suspect that the bad attitude may be a result of a number of people trying to crash the lounge, but that does not excuse it.\r\nSo overall, better than the nearby Sheraton, and convenient to much of the city.'
4,'Cute, sexy, little rooms for those who won\'t be in their rooms much','My boyfriend\'s mother gave us a night at the Hudson as a gift (along with theater tickets). We loved the place. The entrance is very cool and the lobby is impressive. We arrived at noon and had no problem getting a room despite a 3 PM check in time. The desk staff was cheerful and chatty...happy to talk about favorite pizza places and breakfast spots.\r\nI\'m a native New Yorker and knew that our room would be small. It was extremely tiny, but I liked it (maybe that\'s that\'s the little girl in me coming out...mini = cute). The bathroom is definiately interesting with the transparent wall between it and the bedroom, but that keeps the tiny room from being too clausterphobic.\r\nThere were a few nice touches: lots of lighting options, mini-shelf system with cassette and CD player (and good speakers), and full cable (not just a few channels). Perhaps we were lucky, but we never heard a peep from the other rooms. Elevators were quick, security was great (checking key cards at night to make sure the only people getting into elevators were guests or were with guests).\r\nThe only draw back would be the service in the yellow bar and the volume on the music in the bar, lobby and elevators. Definitely club style...loud and techno-ish. Our waitress at the bar was pretty stupid not to stay on top of us...we were prepared to have a few drinks and wound up leaving after one. About 30 minutes later, we went out to get drinks elsewhere and saw our empty glasses still sitting on the table by the couch were we lounged.\r\nThe Hudson\'s location is fantastic. Down the street from Columbus Circle, there are plenty of inexpensive food options within one block. Check out the nice Whole Foods in the bottom of the Columbus Circle mall if you want a quick bite (don\'t go after 5, when lines get long). Times Square is just a few blocks away. \r\nFor great pizza, go left out the door and go down 8th Ave a few blocks to Sacco\'s. The atmosphere is nil, but the pizza is great. For breakfast, hit one of the Cafe Europa locations that are in the Carnegie Hall area (two blocks east of the hotel).'
2,'Hotel Edison','Did not like it at all. I would not recommend this hotel, the pictures look better than the actual room.'
4,'Great location','Great location in heart of Times Square. Hotel itself was nice overall - rooms good sized, bathroom quite nice, decent storage, etc. You can really get around from this spot!\r\nNegatives - \r\nAC in room never did fully cool. \r\nBathroom venting limited - left things very humid after a shower\r\nOdd stale smell in room.\r\nPossible damage by Valet to car so just make sure the check things out if you use the $55 per day service...\r\nCosts in hotel are quite high but that is expected.\r\nWifi - terrible... I couldnt even use it and just used my 3G on the phone and gave up on Ipad. Latpop was great when on the Ethernet in the room. They really need to do something about the Wifi - it is about $15-20 per day and I would have been quite angry if it wasnt free for me as an elite gold.\r\nI would stay here again as it was a good overall experience for sure. Great place for couple or business.\r\nCannot comment on staff other than check in and the maid I talked to who was great! \r\nroom provides a robe, safe, ethernet for internet, sitting area, good storage, etc. \r\nSo - great location and you will have a good quality room overall. Get ready for the odd elevator system where you get assigned one each trip per your floor number (good for busy times but ensures long unnecessary waiting when not). If Wifi is important then plan ahead and set your expectations to extremely low or less... I would stay here again.'
4,'awesome location','This hotel is in an awesome location in the heart of Times Square in NYC. The hotel was recently re-done. The king room is adequate in size. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is very small. Our room had new carpet and drapes and bed coverings but the furniture did not appear to be new. I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the bathroom when we checked in. Good thing I travel with Lysol wipes because I had to clean the toilet seat.....yuk. No other problems in the room. Eating in the restaurant is both expensive and frustrating. Breakfast was good but the service was terrible. We complained and the manager did take 25\% off of our bill to compensate for our inconvenience. Parking is expensive....$39 a day and if you choose to stay longer you will pay $32 for any time after 2 hours once you have checked out. I would however stay here again because of the fantastic location even though there were several things I did not care for. I would not eat there again. There are wonderful and better restaurants right outside the front door.'
5,'Excellent Hotel & Stay','We have just returned from a 4 nt stay at The New Yorker and we honestly could\'nt fault it. From check-in to check-out the staff were so friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 20th floor and small but very clean and comfortable. We had breakfast in the Tick Tock diner every morning and thought it was good value and very tasty. The location is great and i would\'nt hesitate in recommending it to anyone.\r\nLorraine'
3,'Nice... but nothing special.','I stayed here with 3 friends for a birthday trip over superbowl weekend. All in all we didnt have any major complaints, but it wasn\'t as nice as I was expecting. The lobby looks impressive but it\'s not exactly inviting. It\'s all very modern, but the furniture looks like they borrowed it from an airport. I think they were going for looks nice but doesn\'t encourage anyone to linger, in which case, mission accomplished. I\'ve noticed lots of reviews complaining about the speed of the elevators, however we had no problems. There was almost always an elevator waiting for us whenever we hit the button. We were on the 25th floor and had no issues with street noise. \r\nOur room was fine, small, but that\'s to be expected. The facilities staff was very accommodating and agreed to move a small couch for us so that we could fit in a roll away bed. The man who helped us was very nice and eager to please, he even refused to accept a tip. This was a big difference from the guy who checked us in who was clearly annoyed that we didnt use the electronic consoles. He wasn\'t exactly rude but he certainly wasn\'t welcoming. He asked why we were here (exact words..) and when I said it\'s my birthday he just handed me the keys. \r\nMy friend found several suspicious hairs and a few stains on her bed sheets which freaked her out... but she didnt want to complain about them so the hotel never had a chance to fix that issue... does make you wonder how they wash everything though. \r\nI\'m a platinum member of their rewards club and have spent something like 50 nights at hyatts this year, that plus the fact that this trip was scheduled on my birthday, I sort of expected a little more service. All in all, the facilities guy who moved that couch was the only person who made us feel welcome. This might be because we paid for the room with my rewards points.'
4,'4 étoiles moins','Hotel usine mais bien organisé - Quartier fun et bruyant (Times square) - Chambre au 29 ème correcte mais qui mérite un rafraichissement avec mobilier HS (meuble central avec portes cassées !!! ) - Tres bon lit mais largeur 140 (un peu juste en 2012. 160 minimum serait bien ! )- Sle de bain : robinet branlant avec débit d\'eau aléatoire - Personnel sympa et compétent - Resto bien rapport qual/prix- Petit dej cher (plein de possibilités autour pour 5/7 $ par personne) - Lounge sympa - Espace wifi gratuit trop petit (4 fauteuils à coté du lounge ) - le wifi devrait être gratuit dans les chambres dans un Hôtel de ce type !!!!'
5,'Great Location','I stayed there with my 11 year old son. It was our first trip to NY. Check in was fairly smooth,however they failed to have annotated my request for an upgrade,which I had noted that I was willing to pay for. However, was told they had no other rooms as it was completely booked. Our room was fairly large and comfortable. However, we were given a room on the 7th floor, with complimentary breakfast and evening hors derves . SKIP THE BREAKFAST. The hotel is in the middle of everything,theaters,restaurants, times square,subways. The Beds are AWESOME. Would definitely stay there again.'

5,'4.5 stars. Great views. Nice Hotel','I can\'t quite give five stars as I just used the hotel for a place to sleep and get ready for work. I didn\'t use the concierge or eat at the restaurant. \r\nI did however, have a room more spacious than my current apartment. The bedding was amazing. Never wanted to get up. Everything was clean. Check-in was easy and the people were friendly. \r\nThe lobby is on the second floor and spacious. I preferred this to the W hotel lobby which feels crowded to me. \r\nLocation is wonderful too. Would stay here again.'
3,'clean ,boring,just a place to sleep!','we booked this hotel in january last year,2 adults 3 kids,we had a 2 double beded room we booked tru hotels.com,we are starwood prefered guest but when we where checking in we were told we could not get any points as we didnt book directly with the hotel!!this realy put me off,it was very cramped but it was spotless and warm and the beds were very comfy although on the small side a bit! not enough room for us to move about in the room but they had no suites available so we made the most of it.i will say unless your on business or 20 somthing this is not the place for you,its not geared toward family or teenagers,but they were very polite and helpfull,i like clean and modern so it was ok i suppose.the 5 of us are going back to nyc in two weeks but wont be staying the the westin this time ,if anyone has any good family hotels they recomend please feel free to contact me tru tipadvisor.'
3,'Bon rapport qualité prix','Très vieille hotel qui aurait besoin d\'un bon coup de rafraîchissement, mais pour le prix payer, 100$ la nuit, avec les taxes et les frais de services, je m\'attendais à pire, surtout pour un hotels dans le centre-ville de New York juste en face du Madisson Square Garden.\r\nLes 2 seules chose qui m\'on vraiment achaler, ou deux chose et demie, s\'est que le cheak in se fait absolument à 3 heures PM et que du à sa, l\'opération est interminablement longue du au fait que tout le monde font leurs Cheek inn en même temps et deuxième chose, s\'est que pour laissé nos baguage à l\'hotel si on arrive avant le cheak in à 3 heures il y a des frais de 3 ou 4$, pas beaucoup vous direz, mais s\'est le fait qu\'ils savent qu\'on est prie avec nos baguages et qu\'on a pas le choix de payer leur [--] frais si on veux pas être pogner à se promener avec tous nos baguages dans le centre-ville de New York jusqu\'à 3 heures PM, surtout quand on sait que le 3/4 des voyageurs arrivent justement avant 15 heures. À par sa, J\'ai très bien aimé aller à cette hotel, sa fait plusieurs fois que je vais à NYC et s\'est un des meilleurs hotels où j\'ai été\r\nFrédéric de Montréal, Québec Canada'
5,'SUPER, rien a redire !','super hôtel très très bien situé, personnel de ménage discret et aimable, petit déjeuné dans une salle en rez de chaussé (pour un thé, un café et une assiette de pancakes compter 8,7$).\r\nChambre spacieuse, salle de bain propre, clim bruyante mais c\'est un ronron rien de méchant. \r\nles râleurs trouveront toujours quelque chose à redire mais franchement c\'es tun chouette hôtel !'
5,'Comfortable beds','We went to Chicago for the 4th of July weekend. The Palmer house Hilton was a lovely hotel that had been recently renovated. It is in a great location, near many parks, lake Michigan and close to CTA transportation. The entire staff was exceptional and very friendly, with the exception of the bartenders. The bartenders were snooty, aloof and inattentive. I was surprised by their behavior, compared to the rest of the staff. \r\nThe hotel was beautiful. The room was well kept. Check in was fast and easy. The hotel staff was warm and hospitable. The concierge desk was always helpful, friendly, and thorough. The bellmen were helpful and kind. I really enjoyed my stay here.\r\nWe loved the location, and were overall very impressed with the Palmer House.'
4,'Great Experience','Rooms are clean, comfortable, staff is friendly and attentive. New York Marketplace restaurant had good food and good service. The best thing about this hotel though is you really get the sense that you are right in the middle of The City That Never Sleeps, as there seems to be people coming and going all hours of the day and night. If you like people watching, the lobby is fantastic for this. You will see airline crews heading out to their flights around the world (I spoke with a pilot who was flying out to Tel Aviv that night and another who was piloting a 747 to London that evening). And the location can not be beat. Literally in the heart of the city!'
4,'great location, good hotel','This hotel is in a great location making it easy to get to times square etc ........,\r\nWe travelled with our two children aged 10 and 12 and found the room to be of good size for all of us. The rooms were clean and looked ok. We didn\'t eat at the hotel as it was really expensive - especially the room service. Overall a good hotel in a great location.'
5,Fantastic,'Having just come back from here I must say what a fantastic hotel this is due to the fact it\'s just been decorated while having a great location. Finally I got a great deal when booking through low cost holidays usa'
5,'This hotel was great for us.......','Recently enjoyed 4 night stay at New Yorker. We took 2 bedrooms for our family. The rooms were clean, very comfortable and large (both had 2 double beds and a settee). The hotel overall was first class. Perfectly centrally located for many touristy spots and reassuring to see staff very vigilent in aspects of security by checking all entering. The diner is reasonably priced and to a good standard.\r\nOnly negative point we found was the staff, especially in the diner, were very pushy in demanding their tips, but then again this seems the norm in New York.'
5,'Great experience!!','From the time we checked in quickly and efficiently, the Affinia continued to get better! Location perfect, room - fabulous (king suite w/full kitchen) Decor is very sharp and the bed is beyond comfortable! Don\'t believe the reviews on the bathroom being too small - it was perfect, newly updated and sparkling clean! The concierge service was outstanding and the staff was extremely helpful. Would go back and recommend to anyone visiting NYC!! Thank you Affinia Manhattan for making our stay wonderful!!'
3,'Ottima posizione ma camere un po\' squallide.','Abbiamo soggiornati 5 notti in questo hotel, essendo tre persone avevamo una camera con due letti matrimoniali abbastanza grande ma decisamente da ristrutturare, abbiamo però notato che ad altri piani stavano già effettuando dei lavori infatti sul sito internet le foto delle camere non sono assolutamente come quella che ci è capitato. Per quanto riguarda la pulizia e gli spazi comuni non ci si può lamentare così come della posizione che è ottima, vicinissimo a Time square ed alla Metro.'
4,'Fab location, felt safe would go again','The location could not be beaten. The hotel lobby was very elegant and the staff were very helpful. We took advantage of the free safe deposit box for our valuables (beware there is a charge if you lose your key). There is 24 hour security at the elevators. no room pass no access.\r\nOur bedroom was a bit tired but the beds were clean and very comfortable. There is a huge thing about bed bugs in New York, I stripped my bed and checked all the nooks and crannies found nothing and no bites were sustained. Our bed linen and towels were changed every day.\r\nOur break was about seeing the sights so we spent minimal time in the hotel but what time we did spend was fine. On check out day they looked after our bags 50 cent charge per bag, well worth it.\r\nTip take a set of ear plugs people in NY like to use their car horns! and the air conditioning can be a bit noisy neither kept me awake.'
3,'Zentral aber nicht perfekt','Wer zum ersten Mal in New York ist, wird froh sein, so zentral wohnen zu können.\r\nDas Hotel ist allerdings ziemlich in die Jahre gekommen. Drinnen ist es überall düster und die Zimmer sind einfach ausgestattet. Die Betten sind sehr bequem und man schläft sehr gut darin. Bei uns funktionierte der Safe nicht, der Fernseher war defekt und die Dusche lief kaum ab. Der Reinigungsservice fiel unterschiedlich aus. \r\nUnser Gepäck ist auf dem Flug verloren gegangen und wurde ins Hotel nachgeliefert. Das zuständige Personal war sehr uninteressiert an unserem Problem. Auf unsere regelmäßigen Nachfragen wurde nur schwerfällig und lustlos reagiert. Obwohl unser Gepäck nach zwei Tagen eintraf, hat uns niemand darüber informiert. Erst beim Auschecken (!) haben wir unsere Koffer plötzlich erhalten. Wir mussten 4 Tage ohne unser Gepäck auskommen. Soviel Stümperhaftigkeit hätte ich von einem Hotel in dieser Klasse nicht erwartet. Sehr ärgerlich!\r\nDer Hotelmanager hat uns dann als Entschädigung einen Limousinenservice zum Flughafen spendiert.'
4,'It grows on you','I stayed at the Hyatt on business during February. The rooms are a reasonable size, but a bit spartan, but perfectly adequate providing you are not expecting luxury. There are a couple of negatives :the bath is so shallow that it is virtually impossible to immerse more than half of your body and no mini-bar. The latter point irritated me at first, but Hyatt to provide vending machine on each floor with drinks available at normal prices and a Starbucks in reception. This certainly keeps costs down, and Starbucks coffee is much better than the coffee you normally get in the room. The main plus point is location, next to Grand Central Station, and close to the shops. Reception is quick and efficient at all times. So yes, I may stay here again, and it is worth considering unless a long soak in the bath is an essential part of your stay.'
5,'Excellent, excellent, excellent!','My best friends and I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for my birthday. Everything was great -- the room was extremely comfortable and spacious for NYC. The amenities were modern. The staff was wonderful and very helpful! Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a penthouse room (4008) which was one room with two double beds, and an adjoining living room with a pull-out bed. Our 40th floor room had amazing views of midtown. We were also given coupons for free breakfast the next morning at the hotel\'s diner. The food and service at the diner were fabulous. I would definitely stay here again! Everything was great.'
2,'Great location...shabby but clean!!','I initialy stayed in this hotel two years ago on a christmas shopping trip with my mum ( aged 30\'s and a young 60\'s) The location is fabulous with easy access to the downtown areas Soho, East and West Village etc and the shopping around Rockerfeller centre to the North. It is right on Macy\'s doorstep which was handy given the three day snow storm that blew in with our arrival.\r\nThe hotel itself is shabby but is currently under renovation. Our room on that occasion was tired looking but clean. The bathroom was fine...black and white 1930\'s style ( original maybe?) but lots of hot water, good shower and clean white towels daily.There is a coffee shop in the lobby that does good English Breakfast tea for UK visitors in the morning and a bar restaurant that does good food for evenings when the weather gets the better of you\r\nMy mum has since returned on two occasions both for shopping and sight seeing and has just returned from another christms shopping trip.( no funny smell) Again she was in an unrefurbished room but found it comfortable and clean.\r\nIn short this is not a hotel for a luxury trip or romantic weekend away. It will remind you of the Shining but if all you need is a comfortable clean place to sleep in a great location this is fine. After all the money you save on the hotel can help with the shopping!!'
5,'Only one word...Excellent','Stayed there in April 2012 in an executive suite. Like everyone else, we also thought the lobby was stunning. The room was small, even for a suite, but we expected that since they\'re right in the heart of Chicago DT. The staff was helpful in pointing out helpful hints and recommending local restuarants. The breakfast and evening reception was above average and we appreciated that only rooms designated execitive (only two floors) had access to reception and breakfast. Overall, excellent experience and would highly recommend.'
5,'Perfect Location','I stayed here with my sister for 4 nights. The bed was the most amazing bed in the world, super comfortable, luxury linens. The view was nice, we were up on the 20th floor (I believe there are 45 floors). Very quiet, considering it\'s proximity to Times Square. Staff were friendly and helpful. Everything was very clean and spacious. My one tiny complaint was the shower. I expected greater things from the shower head. It was a dual headed spout, and so I was hoping for great water pressure, but it just was sort of ok. But the towels were always soft and great. The location is perfect, right next to the subway line. Within a block of central Times Square, and great walking distance to any of the theaters nearby. Obviously it was expensive, but in New York City, you get what you pay for.'
5,'New York Hilton','close to Central Park, within walking distance of Times Square, beds were comfortable'
4,'Great experience','For a large hotel, we were welcomed, greeted, and helped by the first few people we saw upon arrival. We found this most impressive. We were on the 42nd floor and our room was a great size for NYC. We loved looking down upon Times Square from so high up. Our room was clean and up to date. Highly recommend this hotel.'
4,'Fabulous central location but would have been out of price range if we didn\'t have loyalty points','I\'d only recommend this to a very rich friend or someone who saves loyalty points for the Crowne Plaza / Holiday Inn. I visited New York with a female friend for a shopping weekend in New York.\r\nService was quite interesting - not sure we looked like the usual guests there so the receptionist\'s service was a little bizarre at first. The receptionist\'s attitude changed for the better once she realised we were there on loyalty points and that we were English. \r\nWe had a beautiful twin room (with two double beds) which I think was on the 20th floor overlooking Times Square. The lifts were very fast and almost dizzying. \r\nWe couldn\'t believe you had to pay for WiFi here as this is not usualy in other hotels we\'ve both stayed in the USA. \r\nWe sampled the cocktails in the evening in the bar and we soon decided to moved on as the cocktails were not that great. It was a good though as it made us sample the delights NY had to offer outside the hotel. \r\nWe know the hotel had sports facilities, swimming pool, restaurants etc but didn\'t have time to try them out as shopping was our main aim.'
4,'Ne vale comunque la pena','E\' uno dei posti più alla moda.Vale la pena quanto meno visitarne il bar...tutto l\'albergo è disegnato da Starck.La ristorazione è decisamente separata dalla gestione dell\'albergo..il ristorante (come del resto il bar) è frequentato per lo più da clienti esterni che non pernottano.\r\nIn origine era un motel quindi le stanze, seppur a la page, sono veramente piccole ed è questo il vero difetto dell\'hotel.\r\nUn anno ho prenotato direttamente dal loro sito ed ho avuto una camera di cui non mi posso lamentare (anche se, come ho detto, molto piccola), l\'anno successivo il loro sito aveva qualche problema ed ho prenotato su un altro sito una camera molto più grande ma la posizione era pessima....di fronte a delle turbine che credo ventilassero la cucina o qualcosa del genere...un rumore assordante 24h su 24h....ed entrava un odorino...\r\nEra ad un ottimo prezzo tra gli hotel alla moda di manhattan ma negli ultimi anni tutti i prezzi sono saliti, anche lì.'
4,'What a bargin','Hotel was older and not glamorous but was clean and an excellent bargain. Couldn\'t ask for a better place to stay for the price with such a great location.'
5,'Amazing wedding weekend!','The Palmer was not our wedding venue, but we did have our room block here and we were very pleased. Our guests were so impressed with the old world ambience of the Palmer House and its amazing customer service. Our only hiccup was early on in the process when guests calling to make reservations were told our block was sold out when it wasn\'t even close to being sold out. But a quick call to our contact, Demetrios Kimple, and all was corrected and he even told me I could give all my giests his name and tell them to ask for him directly to make their reservations if I wanted. That was awesome. My now-husband and I stayed three nights ourselves at the hotel for convenience to downtown (we live on the North side) and even though we paid the same affordable room rate as everyone else for a standard room ($179/night), when we opened the door to our room it was a HUGE one-bedroom fully remodeled and gorgeous suite. I couldn;t belive it. It has two bathrooms and a dining room and a wet bars and a living room area and then a separate bedroom behind a closed door with its own bathroom. This was hte perfect place for the bridal party to hang out the morning of the ceremony getting hair and makeup done, and also the day after the wedding our friends concregated there to watch the Belmont Stakes on our huge flatscreen tv. We felt so pampered, especially with the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries that were waiting for us as well! I have actually stayed at he Palmer several times for business as well and had a few business meetings there, and the catering is great, the service is impeccable, and particpants always leave happy. Even the valet and bellhops are wonderful, and the bartenders actually know how to make a good cocktail. Best hotel in Chicago. Thank you Palmer House for making our wedding weekend spectacular!'
2,Bugs!,'I stayed for 2 nights and on the 2nd morning, I saw a bug crawling on top of my down comforter. I called guest services, only to have the phone ringing unanswered for several minutes, so I hung up. I spoke to the manager at the check in desk, and while they were apologetic, it surprised me that they did not seem too surprised! I was here on a conference, but if this was a personal trip, I would not go back to this hotel.'
4,'A good price for the location','Very clean, very comfortable and very quiet..Just the things that will keep us coming back.\r\nCheck in was quick and efficient. The complimentary baggage room was also handy. Our standard room was on the 36th floor with a view of the Hudson and 42nd St west of the hotel. The room was well appointed with a flat screen tv and a full mini bar. Located just a block off Time\'s Square and within easy walking distance of Rockefeller Center. \r\nThe hotel has one restaurant, Shula\'s, which is pricey. The bar serves a bar menu. Our breakfast in Shula\'s was excellent, if expensive ($80 w/tip). There are many restaurants nearby including everything from McDonald\'s to fine dining. \r\nOne minor complaint. I picked up a bottle of water in the minibar with the intent of buying it until I saw the price. Eight dollars is just too much for bottled water. I put it back later to find that I was billed for it. Apparently the minibar has a sensor that automatically bills you when something is lifted in the minibar. Fortunately I noticed the charge at check out and the desk clerk removed it from the bill.'
5,'Great location..','What a great hotel.\r\nThis is located in the thearter district.\r\nWe would stay here again. Loved NY...'
5,'My favorite place to stay in NYC!','This hotel is in the best location in the City. It is right in the heart of Times Square! If you are lucky enough to get a room with a view you are in for a treat! The rooms are in great condition and are a nice size for rooms in NYC. The staff is pleasant, room service is wonderful and the decor is beautiful! The hotel overall is pretty amazing. The elevator ride to your room gives you a view of all they have to offer including the fitness center. About the fitness center....it has every machine you need to get a great workout in before you go out to check out the town! They have an amazing restaurant and lounge on a high floor (don\'t remember the name) but you have to check them both out, the food is high end and delish!!!! They are beautiful and they rotate so you get a great view of the entire city as you enjoy your adult beverage, coffee, tea, meal, etc. Do not miss this one, it\'s a keeper! :)'
2,'Only by being a good place','Too old , but the localization is very good. We can find very interesting attractions a few steps from the hotel. (Madison Square Garden, Macy´s, etc)'
3,'First class... except for the damn air-con','I have to say that previous reviews are well wide of the mark, the room was recently refurbished to a good quality and was very clean. We upgraded for £5 to a deluxe and think the extra space certainly helped. \r\nBut as others have said, when you\'re in New York you don\'t really want anything other than somewhere to be a base and to sleep and as far as location is concerned, for a basic hotel, I can\'t really imagine anywhere better.\r\nBut then was the down side, as our first night and our last night involved some of the worst nights sleep I\'ve ever had. I\'m an unfussy sleeper and in a front facing room there\'s always going to be outside noise, that\'s fine - but the air conditioning honestly sounded like someone was playing a steel drum in the room with us.\r\nWhen we mentioned it, the problem was rectified for two nights, but was back again with a vengence on the last night. \r\nSo, it looses a star for that, but we would stil come back again in a shot, albeit if I could get someone to guarantee the air-con had been recently serviced.\r\nAlso, for any prospective visitors, we must join in the praise for the Deli next door, packed with locals in the morning and incredibly reasonable given the location.'
3,Disappointing,'My family and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York for a week in July. The hotel staff we dealt with weren’t exactly friendly, but that’s another story… Approximately a month after we left, we checked our bank statement and noticed that 2 weeks after we left the Grand Hyatt New York, some money had been taken out from our bank account by Hyatt Hotels. We dealt with it and a few weeks later some of the money was reimbursed, as it had been wrongfully taken. We were told that we had been charged for using the music channel on TV, which we hadn’t. When we checked in we had to give our debit card details at the check-in desk in case there were any issues. When we checked out we asked whether there were any issues and we were told there weren’t. Then, a few weeks later they took the liberty of taking money out of our account without even bothering to inform us about it! If we hadn’t checked the bank statement we would have never found out…The thing is that, when they reimbursed us the money it wasn’t the same amount of money they had taken out. I assume that this was due to different exchange rates, but the fair and right thing to do would have been to reimburse the money with the same exchange rate with which was taken out from our account. It was wrongfully taken, so I don’t see why we have to end up losing money when we have done nothing wrong for the money to be taken.The overseas transaction fee that we were charged because of their meddling with our account wasn’t reimbursed either.I have sent six emails to the Hyatt Service Desk, asking them for their comments on the matter, and I haven’t received a response. In the last couple of emails I asked them to send me a complaints form. No response. Shameful, taking into account the amount of money we spent there, that they don’t even have the decency to reply to a customer’s email.'
5,'Loved it !','This hotel is located in the heart of Times Square and everything is a stone throw away be it theatres, cinemas, and night life. Amazing location and fantastic spacious rooms. Highly recommend it.'
2,'Nothing but great location','old and not charming building,tiny rooms which are not pleasant to the eye,the over all feeling is\r\nthat except for a great location there is nothing good to write home about.'
4,'Nice Large TV and Comfy Bed','We had a reservation at The Manhattan Club that was messed up by their staff. Before we could get it straight, we found ourselves here for a couple of nights. Once straightened out, we moved into our room at the Manhattan Club and wanted to return to this one!\r\nOur room was large and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The TV was a nice new larger one in the room...bathroom was clean and towels were nice.\r\nI\'d highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing for a comfortable stay in a great location!'
2,'Somente em ultimo caso','Hotel muito grande ,antigo e precisando de varios reparos .O quarto tem cheiro de velho ,como tenho riniti alergica ficou dificil o sono fungando pelos acaros .A localização é otima ,perto de tudo .Entrada glamurosa ,sagão em marmores e etc.... porem saindo do mesmo inicia os carpetes antigos ,levava choque em tudo que tocava ,pela estatica .Ao apertar o botao do elevador ,via estalos de tanto choque .Foi horrivel administrar esse fator da estatica neste hotel ,nunca mais ,prefiro o Wellington .'
1,'Bed Bugs, Rude Staff, Long Lines, Moldy, Worn Out, Filthy...','Simply put, I had rather sleep in the gutter than ever return here. I came home with bed bugs. For most of the staff English is not yet a second language. The lobby is always crowed with pushy airline personnel. I waited in line for nearly three hours (combined) to check in/out. This place should be closed for sanitary reasons. It has a documented history of bed bugs and other unacceptable features. DO NOT BE A FOOL.: NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!'
5,'Perfect NYC location and a great stay!','My husband and I just stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 days. We arrived early and were able to check-in to our room. We really enjoyed our renovated room on the 23rd floor. It was much bigger than many of the hotel rooms we have stayed in NYC. The bed was very comfortable and after some long days wandering the city, we really appreciated the upgraded bedding. The housekeeping staff also did a great job keeping the room clean and replacing the toiletries. We had purchased a breakfast package which worked out great. The staff at the restaurant were very friendly and attentive. The breakfasts, coffee and juice were all very good. The location next to Grand Central Station made using the subway so easy. Even though parts of the hotel are still under renovation, we were never bothered by any of the noise or construction. When we checked out, we were able to leave our luggage with the Bell Captain for $2 per bag while we explored the city until our later flight. Perfect stay in the city!'
4,'Spacious rooms and good service','Spent three nights here on business. The room in the 20th floor was huge compared to typical European hotel rooms. Breakfast was not included in the price, so I took the Hilton buffet breakfast (USD 20) every morning. In this option you can also order omelette, pancakes, etc. separately, but all waiters did not remember to tell that. The buffet was very good. The swimming pool is too small and warm for serious swimming, but nice for just relaxing. I did not find any change room, so I had to change the swimsuit in the separate toilet/shower room. The location is great, and the hotel is very beautiful, especially the famous lobby. There was a large meeting at the hotel, and during the meeting the elevators were really slow: in some cases I had to wait 5-10 minutes to get one.'
5,'Beautiful, historic hotel across the street from Millenium Park and five minutes from Magnificent Mile','The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are large and clean. Beds are sooo comfortable. (My friend\'s room was missing a makeup mirror). Service is excellent. We were offered the upgrade to the executive floor which provided a second bathroom (excellent for two sets of moms travelling with teenaged daughters), a private elevator, a buffet breakfast (simple but nice; no variety day-to-day) starring the excellent efforts of Ernest, and some early evening snacks (these were ok).'
5,'Great Hotel, Great Location.','I stayed in this hotel during July 2011 and I have to say everything about it was simply great. The hotel room was very well priced, clean, had everything required in a hotel room. The Hotel staff could not do enough for you, always happy to help. The location of the hotel was perfect, across the raod from Madisson Square garden, minutes away form both the Empire State Buliding & Times Sqaure. With the exception of Battery Park (this is where we took the boat to the statue of liberty) Everything is withing walking distance. This hotel is a must.'
4,'Good service, but rooms smelled','Stayed there for 4 nights with 4 co-workers. Each of the rooms had an odor. Would think it comes from the vents for all rooms on different floors ranging from 10 to 42 ot have the same smell. Heavinly shower was not very heavinly. I was in the Dallas/Fort Worth Westin late Jan and the shower was fantastic. Clean rooms and good service at each location though.'
5,'pleasant surprise','stayed here for a recent conference so didnt actually choose it but we were surprised how good it was. the room was spacious with really comfortable beds, big bathroom and a great view. loved the sushi bar it was fantastic and having a cocktail looking down on Time Square was fun. look forward to returning to the Marriott and if you want to be right in the centre of Time Sq and close to all the theatres then its a great option.'
2,'A big let down','We stayed at the Grand Hyatt as the last stop of our honeymoon. Having spent 2 weeks prior in fantastic hotels on the west coast we were looking forward to staying at the Hyatt (which was about 3 times the price as any other hotel we\'d been in). At first sight the Hyatt is impressive with a busy lobby full of christmas decorations however this luxury was not reflected in the rooms. Firstly, we arrived in the early hours of the morning due to a cancelled flight - I rang them to let them know that we would be this late. When we checked into our double room we found ourselves in a twin room - not so good for a honeymoon couple! I rang reception to ask if we could change to a room with a larger bed and were told they would ring us back - which they didn\'t. I went down to the lobby to ask and was told there was no further availability but to check again in the morning. When I went back to the room we realised we were also in a smoking room, despite all of our booking information requesting a non-smoking room. In the morning I requested a room change and was given another room - this time it was non-smoking but was still a twin. The rooms have minimal amenities (i.e. A TV, a closet, a safe, some toiletries) and there was mould in the bathroom, ingrained dirt in the tiny bath, and loose light fittings in the bedroom (see photos). We paid an awful lot of money to stay at this hotel (over £300 per night) and, whilst I am aware a good proportion of that money was because it was New York and it was Christmastime, I still think that the price was extortionate for what amounted to a room which wouldn\'t look out of place in a cheap B&B (and there are a lot of hotels available in New York for the same price which would have been far better value for money). On the plus side, most of the staff were reasonably friendly and knowledgeable, the location is fairly good for shopping etc, and there is a shuttle bus which goes from a stop just outside Grand Central to JFK airport every 20 minutes. \r\nI think the Hyatt is in real need of a makeover and it would be nice if they spent as much attention on their rooms as they do on their lobby - having said that, the hotel was very busy so I guess they don\'t really feel like they need to make the effort. I personally wouldn\'t recommend this hotel to anyone unless they had money to waste.'
4,'You won\'t be disappointed.','This is a good location, lots to do around the hotel but the hotel itself is very nice and despite its age, which I believe adds character, this is a beautiful and comfortable hotel.'
2,'Nice on the outside, not so much on the inside','I take a group of students to NYC every year for a conference and we stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania every time. Why? Because our school will only let us stay at the place with the lowest bid and Hotel Penn always has the lowest bid. It is doable. There were no bed bugs on any occasion, but the rooms are old and in need of repairs. Our room this year smelled terribly of smoke, the AC and fan were broken, the bathroom door didn\'t close and there was jackhammering outside our window from midnight until 2AM every morning. The sheets were clean and the towels looked clean, but didn\'t smell super fresh. If I had a choice to go somewhere else I would, but given the situation the Hotel Penn isn\'t so bad that I won\'t go back again next year.'
4,'Fantastic location !!','We have just returned from a family holiday staying at the above hotel for a week. We found the location fantastic just off Times Square opposite the M&M\'s store. \r\nAs we had our 13 and 10 year old with us we didn\'t use the bar or restaurant but they both looked lovely.\r\nThe swimming pool is very good but small (you will need to wear a swimming cap - you can buy one at the gym reception). The gym was being refurbished but still very good with great facilities. \r\nI would definitely stay there again.'
4,'Slap Bang in the Middle of it all','I stayed in the Crowne Plaza as part of my trip to New York with the charity Sense to run the ING New York City Marathon 2007. As you arrive at the hotel the porter comes to take your luggage up to your room (they LOVE a tip in New York - there is someone to do nearly everything for you for a small tip). The hotel is lovely and couldn\'t be better placed (literally opposite the neon lights of the famous Times Square. Our room faced the Hudson River so the view wasn\'t as amazing as it could have been had we been round the front of the hotel BUT it was still a great view as its New York City and everywhere you look is an amazing view. I love New York. \r\nThe beds in this hotel are designed to help you get a better nights sleep and my it works and its just what I needed after the marathon.'
2,Trato,'El trato en el check inn es frio nada amable y con lo que respecta al personal de limpieza recibimos un mal trato, ya que nos la sra que limpiaba entraba de muy mal humor, se lo hicimos saber a una persona del restaurant y el gerente hablo con nosotros y nos cambio la persona que limpiaba el cuarto. Pero aun asi el trato lo sentimos frio por parte de todo su personal'
3,'Great location, not so great hotel','I stayed here because of a trade show in the same hotel. The location is ideal in the middle of New York\'s theatre district and very close to the E train, especially if you are taking the subway from JFK. A few blocks from the R train if you want to go Little Italy, Chinatown, So Ho. \r\nMy room was upgraded and normal size. My colleage was not as fortunate and got a very tiny room. The rooms are in need of renovation, older more tired decor. Views are not great as there are tall buildings all around you so mostly get a view of an office tower 50\' away. Noise levels were high as there was street work going on from midnight to 6AM and no chance to change rooms or be walked to a nearby hotel. There solution was earplugs and I can\'t sleep with foam in my ear. In contrast, we stayed at the Doubletree at Time Sq. a few block away and it\'s so much nicer for about the same price and there you can get awesome views of Time Sq. . \r\nThe reception area is very nice, the staff if very friendly and helpful. The restaurant where I got the free buffet breakfast was older, but food was good, service was good.'
4,'Funky hotel, suited for younger travellers','Great hotel, the decor and bars are brilliant in the hotel. In true ny style this a hotel that never sleeps, we arrived back to the hotel after midnight and the hotel was more like a club. There were bouncers on the lift which was a nice touch making sure only guests were allowed near the rooms. All the staff were extremely helpful, sharing ideas and recommendations for our trip. The rooms were very small but as you don\'t go ny to stay in your hotel room it wasn\'t an issue for us. We would definitley stay here again'
5,'GENIAL, PRECIOSO Y CERCA DE TODO','Esta muy bien situado, justo al lado de Grand Central Station, y del Chrysler Building, a un paseo de Times Square, de la Quinta Av. y Central Park, o sea muy cerca de todo, el hotel en general es grandioso, tiene un hall muy amplio y bonito, y en recepción te dan una atención muy buena, las habitaciones son espaciosas, y algunas dan justo a la entrada Chrysler Building, que es precioso de noche.'
1,'DO NOT stay here!!','There is really nothing nice about this hotel. the lobby is old and very dated, the corridors and lifts are even more dated and the rooms are grotty and smelly. This is a 2 star hotel with outrageous 5 star prices. This hotel has been left rotting for years with no investment whatsoever and It is a real pity because with some redecoration it could be restored to the great hotel I can only assume it once was many many years ago!'
4,'A special place . . .','Having read several reviews, both negative and positive, I felt obliged to offer my opinions of our stay here. On arrival, we found the staff co-operative and friendly. The elevator was quick despite the apologies for any delays due to renovation. Our room was excellent. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was very clean and the widescreen TV was impressive. We couldn\'t hear a thing outside, presumably because our room was not facing 7th Ave. Staff at the restaurant and in the lobby on our departure were once more accommodating and efficient. The hotel is in a brilliant location, just a stone\'s throw from Central Park and a brief stroll down to Times Square. Nearby we found an excellent Irish Bar called Carney\'s and had a fantastic, value for money breakfast at \'la Parisienne\' restaurant on 7th Ave. on the way to Central Park. Our holiday in this fantastic city was definitely enhanced by our stay at the Park Central Hotel. \r\nNigel and Lisa, Lancashire, England'
5,'Great Hotel, loved it!','I purchased our room through Priceline. I was a little worried with the reviews I had seen on line. It is listed as a Boutique hotel which Wikipedia states is intimate, usually luxurious or quirky hotel environments. This hotel was all that and more! The rooms are very small but the design of the room and the use of the space available makes them seem larger. I love the hardwood floors in all the rooms, much better than nasty hotel carpeting! \r\nThe customer service at this hotel was phenomenal ! I had read that the employees were worried more about looking good than helping the customers. We did not find this to be the case at all! There was always someone at the front desk to help and everyone went out of their way to make sure our stay was good.'
5,'Very comfortable hotel in prime location','My husband and I stayed here in September this year while on a fly drive holiday. The Hotel is really lovely and high class. All the staff were very helpful and polite. The rooms were also spacious and well decorated. The bar and lounge area was gorgeous. I would definatly stay here again. we had a very noisey couple next door the first night so asked to move rooms and the hotel arranged this with no quibble.'
5,'The Honest Reviewer','Stayed for nights at the beginning of August , asked for an upgrade due to just getting engaged and they put us in the preferred floor, room was awesome, big king size bed, great tv with movies on demand. Customer service was excellent, location excellent. Shower was awesome and bed was very comfortable. Would stay again in a heartbeat.'
5,'Amazing hotel in the heart of NYC!','We arrived early on the day of check-in. This wasn\'t a problem. We were immediately given the keys to our room, even though we were 2 hours early. The hotel was exceptional. Clean rooms, friendly service. The concierges were very helpful and polite. Buffet in the restaurant extremely good for a wonderful price. The fitness center on the 23rd floor was beautiful, with windows overlooking Times Square. Cannot wait to go back!'
4,'Beautiful Room-Great Location','My husband and I stayed for one night and found the hotel to be very satisfactory. The decor was beautiful, location was great-right next door to Grand Central Station. Our only complaint was that the air inside was a bit stuffy. We wished we could have turned the thermostat lower as it was a very warm night. The package we booked included breakfast which was delicious and the service was great. It was overall a fantastic stay. We would definitely stay again if returning to New York!'
5,'Perfect location, great view, spacious rooms','The Crowne Plaza is directly located at the Times Square in Manhattan and not as many other hotels that claim to be at the Times Squares, but are in reality a block away. The hotel has a kind of stylish interior. The reception is a bit inconveniently located at the first floor, reachable through a stairway. The rooms are spacious and especially the corner rooms, AFAIK no upgrade necessary, are even nicer. Bathroom (in the niche of the main room) and toilet/shower are separated. Price for a one night stay from Sunday to Monday was 320 USD.'
4,'Fantastic location, room, and facilities...poor service.','I am a huge Marriott fan. I even own a Marriott vacation club property. As a single dad I either trade my unit in or use my rewards points to take my 8 yr old son on a 2 week vacation every summer. Last year we did San Francisco and Santa Monica. This year its NYC and Boston. \r\nWe just arrived home from NYC. What a fantastic holiday. First the good. If you have children this hotel\'s location, and unique lobby is the best in times square! The elevators are fine and exciting. Many of the rooms have fantastic views of times square! For NYC they are spacious! The 1,2,3,7,A,C,E subway lines are all within 3 blocks. \r\nNow the bad. I don\'t think I\'ve ever said that in a review about a Marriott or affiliated property. However, if they are going to receive my endorsement then they must endure my criticism as well. \r\nWith the exception of the housekeepers...who were great...I honestly felt as though every employee was either hired last week, or simply too burned out to care anymore. Marriott runs an add on the in house TV about how incredibly competent and gracious the at your service folks are. I found them to be annoyed and put off by simple requests for a refrigerator and missed newspaper. In both cases it took 2-3 calls.\r\nI worked as a concierge for 5 years when I was younger. I found the staff to be unprepared or disengaged. I asked for simple things like direction via subway to La Gaurdia airport. These are the types of things that you have printed sheets for. They knew the numbers of the trains and busses but couldnt tell you small details that are needed in a city like NYC. The same thing happened for the fireworks show. In this case there was a standard form, but the concierge got the details regarding viewing areas and street closing completely wrong. This was THE big event of the weekend. How do you not discuss it and prepare?\r\nFinally, the luggage storage system is rediculous. There are 4 guys standing at a counter willing to take your bags. They are very pleasant and efficient. The problem is when go to retrieve the bags at street level, there is just one bellman. I waited for 20 minutes while a man kept ringing a little desk bell. Nobody came. Finally, my son started to ring it. When I complained, the employees immediately made excuses or just stared blankly at me. \r\nThis sums up the staff. Rather than acknowledge your issue and offering to help, they either make an excuse or pass the buck. \r\nMarriott does better in Bueno Aries, Rio, Atlanta (Marquis) San Francisco (Marquis), LA, and Chicago. They can do it in NYC as well!'
5,'Customer Service Feedback','Overall, my stay at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel was great! This was my second time staying at Affinia, and the service was excellent. In addition, what motivated me to write this review was the excellent customer service I received from Jenna. \r\nFrom the time I checked in by the front desk, Jenna greeted me in a warm and gracious manner. After checking in the computer, she informed me about the complementary upgrade to my room and internet use during my stay.\r\nJenna\'s business friendly communication style left a strong enough impression to remind me the importance of staff members consistently demonstrating quality customer service to others.\r\nExcellent job Jenna!'
2,Horrible!!!,'The rooms were dirty, I had an awful stay. There was no wi fi, bad smell, and a lot of humidity in the rooms and hallways.'
5,'Fantastic stay!!!','I can praise this hotel any higher. From the moment I walked in I felt right at home. The staff were fantastic. The rooms are big and roomy and the beds are to die for. I know my new home now when I return to New York.'
3,'Expected more from a 4 star hotel !','just returned from a 4 day trip to NYC and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Time square. Great location, within easy reach of most major attractions. Hotel itself was a little dissapointing for a 4 stars, room was relatively large as we were told on arrival that we had been upgraded to a room facing the broadway. However the decor was a little dated to say the least, broken tiles in the bathroom and the worn out fixed shower unit on the wall caused quite an inconvenience when trying to wash our 4 year old daughter\'s hair. The bath was cracked and dirty, despite the room being cleaned every day the bathroom floors was never once swept. The hotel needs a series revamp before it can be classified as a true 4 stars !'
5,'Location and Comfort couldn\'t be better','The location in Times Square couldn\'t be better...right in the heart of the city with easy access to all points North, South, East and West! The staff was friendly and helpful. Can\'t wait to go back!'
3,'Okay, but fix the elevator problem!','Spent the weekend of October 7th at the Marriot. The room was very nice, breakfast buffet was OK. Overall the New Yorkers were very friendly (except for the staff at the Marriot). The elevator condition was very annoying. They really need to do something about that. You could be waiting for 10 minutes by yourself and all of a sudden 20 people show up and if you are not standing by the one that opens you do not get on!'
4,'good location, fab beds','excellent location near central park and ten minutes down to Times Square. The hotel could do with a sign outside though! Small rooms as I expected but clean, modern and the bed was huge with luxurious bedding. Bathroom window into bedroom was bizarre but would stay there again. Didnt eat there but reception staff very helpful. Luggage storage/checkout very good on departure day.'
3,'Convenient location.','As others have said, this is a very convenient location. As a result of this, the area is very busy (verging on manic). The subway is right across the street or around the corner, depending in which direction you wish to travel. Drug store, 24 hour Macdonald\'s and 24 hour diner (quite expensive) all on the door step. Right across from Madison Square Gardens and around the corner from Macey\'s. Oh and avoid TGI Fridays (right across the street), it is absolutely filthy - expecially the toilets. The rooms were small, but clean and adequate and the beds were comfortable. We also got quite a good rate. Our visit to this hotel was marred by the very pushy and rude bell boy, who took exception to us booking our own taxi when departing for the airport. He obviously had some kind of arrangement with certain taxi drivers who charge around $20 more than we managed to agree with an independant taxi driver. This made him very sore when we told him that we didn\'t want a taxi, but then went to the driver we had actually booked. He came over and gave us a mouthful of abuse, obviously sore that he would be losing out on his cut of the money. I will be making a complaint to the hotel about this awful man. Surely it is up to us where and when we spend our money; do not be intimidated in to booking the cab that they have arrangements with. For the record, if you book a private car with the transportation people (also very pushy) within the hotel it is $85 dollars to Newark Airport including taxes and tolls (but not the tip). If you arrange a taxi with the bell boy, it will be around $90 (obviously to cover his and the taxi driver\'s cut of the extra). With the independent taxi drivers the same trip will be $70 including taxes and tolls, the tip is extra. Our taxi driver was fully registered, he just didn\'t have the arrangement with the bell boys. He was also one of the more polite people that we came across in New York City, and one of the few people who deserved our tip. All in all a decent hotel, but certain staff seriously need to take a course in etiquette and customer service.'
4,'Will return to the Westin Times Square','Our family stayed at the Westin Times Square 8/27 to 8/30 . We are Starwood gold members and were upgraded to a VIP room. I assume VIP means upper floors, as my wife and daughter had stayed there once before in a larger corner, non VIP room. However, I do recommend getting an upper level room if possible as the room was very quiet, and we could hear very little city noise. Overall, the room was small, but this is probably to be expected in NYC. However it was comfortable with the heavenly beds and dual showhead we\'ve come to expect with Westin hotels. I would add that there is very little counter space in the bathroom. The location is very convenient to Times Square and Broadway theatres. All the staff we encountered were courteous, friendly and helpful. Our plan is to stay here again on our next visit to NYC.'
5,'Quality, stylish and good value','We stayed in New Yorker for 3 nights for a shopping and sightseeing trip. We arrived at approx 4pm we checked in very quickly and smoothly, no long line as some reviews have claimed, we were allocaded a lovely room on 28th floor with 2 double beds and ample room for our clothes and luggage, nice decor, good air con, an art deco style bathroom, large flat screen tv and 3 windows on 2 sides to admire the amazing views of Crysler Building, Madison Square Garden etc. We ate once in the Tic toc diner for breakfast, it was delicious and huge portions. The hotel is only across the road from Penn Station (where we got train from Newark Airport) and one block from Macy\'s and 3 blocks from Empire State Building and across the road from Madison Square Garden and only 10 mins walk to Times Square so an ideal location to stay. We enjoyed a few cocktails at Lucy\'s Cantina just diagonally accross from hotel, it has a fab roof top area if it\'s a nice day. I would definately stay here again, a superb location for a great price.'
4,'comfortable and great location','i stayed at the Park Central hotel over new year weekend, i have to say i thought it was good. cannot understand the bad reviews. All you need from a hotel in new york is a comfortable bed, so what if the lifts takes a while?? check in was quick and simple, the room was clean and tidy, the only downside was the toilet didnt flush, but so what? just meant the cleaners had to sort it out. check out is at 12.00 wever when we tried to get into the room at 11.45 our key didnt work seems like the cleaners locked our room as they assumed we had finished with it, we explained we had another 15 mins and that we needed to collect our suitcase and the cleaner opened our door, no problem.\r\ni have stayed at this hotel twice, and will continue to do so.'
5,'Excellent location','this hotel is located right in the heart of New York City, Rockefeller Center. The hotel is huge and has many restaurants inside the hotel to dine in. The concierge is very helpful in giving directions and recommending nice restaurants. It\'s a safe location and the rooms are a nice size and clean. The prices vary but are average for the New York area. They have a very nice size gym. The hotel is within walking distance of all Broadway plays, Central Park, Radio City Music Hall. I highly recommend it. Very nice staff!'
5,'El mejor situado y buenisimo hotel!!!','Estuve con mis hijas y mi marido, fantástico hotel!!!! Las habitaciones modernas y cómodas, la de mis hijas y la nuestra daba encima de Times Square, UNA MARAVILLA!!! El poco rato que estábamos en el hotel me lo pasaba mirando por las enormes ventanas!!! Lo recomiendo especialmente, Y también el restaurante que hay en la ultima planta, es rotatorio y mientras cenas puedes deleitarte con las vistas de ny!!!! Buenisima hotel'
5,'Faultless Spotless Hotel','Maybe I have low expectations, but the New Yorker was an absolutely fantastic hotel in my eyes, superb location, right by Penn Station, a 2 minute walk to the Port Authority Bus Station, all manner of 24hour food outlets surround you, very well air conditioned rooms, great showers, great view, the hotel staff were amazingly helpful with all the sights my wife and I were searching for, circling areas on maps for us and suggesting what method of transport to use to get where we wanted to be, I will be returning there next summer for another week.'
4,'Love Being Central','This hotel lived up to its standards. From the moment you walk in, you are welcomed by a grand lobby. Being around Christmas time, the decorations in the lobby really made you feel the festive spirit. \r\nThe reception is quite efficient in its processing, given the number of people coming through the hotel. The staff maintain their friendliness as well, even during times of difficulty. So that is really commendable. \r\nThe room we got had a great view, being the corner room. Apparently it was the Deluxe Room, so it was slightly larger than the Standard Rooms they had on offer. This was very much appreciated. Not only was the room bigger, but the bathroom was also more spacious as well. The room had modern furnishings in it, with a big flat screen TV. A large desk is also available for use if you need it. The amenities provided in the bathroom are also top quality, which is always appreciated. The beds are also very comfortable, making it ideal for those coming off a long flight like we did. \r\nThe fitness centre is at the top floor of the hotel. This makes for a great view and a good motivation for going to the gym. The hotel has a couple of bars and restaurants as well, so plenty of things to entertain you.\r\nThe hotel\'s location is probably it\'s best asset. The hotel is right above Grand Central Station, which means it is easily accessible from all modes of transport. Shuttle buses from the airport stop right out the front of Grand Central Station as well. So no matter what mode of transport you are taking, except a plane of course, you can easily get to the hotel. You are only a couple of blocks from 5th Ave. Taxis are cheap if you need to get anywhere in Manhattan since it is such a central location. \r\nDefinitely worth coming back to if I am in NY again.'
1,'absolute garbage','There was someone else\'s trash in the bin, the towels were filthy, there were brown stains all over the sheets, the toilet didn\'t flush, the \'fitness centre\' was an unlit service corridor filled with bins, use of the internet is expensive, and the staff at the desk were incompetent.'
1,'Nicht empfehlenswert - heruntergekommen und teuer','Ich war im September im Edison Hotel und kann nur jedem Reisenden davon abraten. Das Hotel ist in einem total heruntergekommen Zustand. Die hygienischen Verhältnisse lassen sehr zu wünschen übrig (inkl. Kleintierchen). Ich war schon oft in New York, aber so etwas habe ich selten erlebt. Die Zimmer sind kleine, die Ausstattung alt und kaputt. In der Lobby des Hotels ist ein Betrieb wie auf dem Bahnhof. Das Personal ist unfreundlich und man wird unfreundlichst behandelt. Mein Zimmer und die Flure hatten einen modrigen Geruch, der auch jetzt noch in meinem Koffer zu riechen ist. Das Frühstücksrestaurant ist eine Zumutung, aber man kann in der Umgebung an jeder Ecke etwas besseres finden. Die Lage ist sicherlich gut, aber es gibt vielen empfehlenswertere Hotels in diesem Viertel. Und ich werde das nächste mal auch lieber ein paar Meter laufen und ein etwas entfernteres Hotel bevorzugen, als in dieses Hotel zu gehen. Lage ist halt nicht alles. Unglaublich, dass Gruppen in dieser Unterkunft noch absteigen und es schien so als wären hier fast nur Jugendgruppen untergebracht gewesen. Mein Tipp: Hotel abreißen und neu bauen.'
5,'Great service, best choice of hotel in Times Square','Great hotel, great location. Close to all the theaters in Broadway. Great restaurants.'
5,'Just wonderful! Would love to go back!','The staff was all very friendly, the room was very clean and well kept. Everything ran smoothly my entire 3 night stay. I appreciated the Bell Service at no extra charge to hold our bags while we took some more time the morning of our departure to see the city.'
4,'Modern Rooms, service needs improvement','Overall a nice place to stay in NYC. Just returned from a 4 night stay. Location is good. We like visiting the upper East side as well as SoHo so the Times Square location is nicely in between. Rooms were clean and very modern. Bathrooms are small but heavenly bath is nice. There is a bit of noise from the toilets in adjoining rooms as the flush is super charged. Fitness center is pretty average and costs $10 to use. Internet access is $15. Bar 10 is ok but is a bit undermanned in terms of waitstaff, also some of the wine glasses we received there were actually pretty dirty and had to be sent back. My only real gripe is about the housekeeping service. Everyday somehow they forgot to replace hand towels or shampoo. Also on one day our room wasn\'t made up by the time we returned at 6pm! I think it probably was a busy week.'
5,'Great location and services','This was located in a fantastic area and we got it just so we could see the ball drop for NYE. Facilities were great especially the club rooms. We did have an issue with a door that self-locked and no-one apart from security could get it us in. However the staff were fantastic and gave us extra points on our SPG account. Loved the hotel, staff great and location awesome. Could get to anything quickly on Manhattan from the subway that was nearby. Would be happy to stay here again! Was surprised at how quite the rooms were on the 8th floor.'
