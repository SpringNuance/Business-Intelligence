'Excellent Hotel','We stayed at the Southgate Tower for 6 nights in April 2004. We had previously stayed at another hotel in New York but due to travelling with friends decided to try somewhere different with more room for us all.\r\nWhen we arrived at the hotel the reception staff were very friendly and apologised that our room was not quite ready. After about a 5 minute wait we were taken to our room with our luggage.\r\nWe were pleasantly surprised with the room. It was very spacious and perfect for 4 people sharing as there was plenty of room for us not to feel as though we were living on top of each other for the next 7 days. After taking a look around the room we noticed one of the blinds wouldn\'t stay down, we called reception and within 5 minutes they sent someone to our room to fix it. We had no further problems after that.\r\nThe suite we stayed in was perfect for us. It had 2 bathrooms, the bedroom had 2 double beds and plenty of space for clothing, the living room was very large and the sofa coverted into a sofa bed, and the kitchenette had all mods cons - fridge, microwave, tea/coffee making facilites, microwave. We also had an iron and ironing board and a television in the living room and bedroom.\r\nThe room was very clean and the chambermaids came round every day. They restocked the tea, coffee etc and always left clean towels. They were also happy to come back at a more convenient time if you were still in your room.\r\nThe hotel was in a perfect location, Madison Square Gardens is over the road, Macy\'s and other major stores are a couple of blocks away and so is the Empire State Building. We also took taxis to each end of the island and walked back to the hotel (which is roughly in the middle on Manhattan), this way we got to see more of Manhattan and did some shooping on the way.\r\nThere is a fire station underneath the hotel which can cause some noise, but nowhere in New York is quiet. We found that the noise didn\'t bother us and slept with the window open most nights.\r\nThe restaurant and bar that is connected to the hotel is also a place to visit if you don\'t feel like going too far one night. Although we didn\'t get chance to dine in the restaurant we found the bar staff very friendly and they made us feel very welcome. \r\nThe hotel staff were very friendly and recommended places to eat, they also pre booked a taxi for us when it was time to leave as we needed a people carrier to transport us to the airport.\r\nWe have looked at other hotels we could possibly stay in when we return to New York, but due to having such a great time at the Southgate Tower and due to it being in such a prime location we have decided we wouldn\'t stay anywhere else. We would recommend this hotel to everyone.',1


'Loved it','We loved this hotel. Fantastic location, almost opposite Madison Square Garden, only a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, and a short walk up 7th Avenue to Times Square. We had a studio room. The room itself was huge! Big king size bed, writing desk, table and chairs and a dresser. The kitchen was great too. The only thing I would criticise would be the bathroom which was tiny. But if you thought the bathroom was tiny, the shower was even smaller. I\'ve never seen anything like it. I couldn\'t wash my hair without my elbows touching the walls! And I\'m not a big person! It was small! But the water pressure was great, so that kind of made up for it! Other than that, this hotel is great. Oh and it has a great bar for a few drinks too!!',1

'Wonderfully Wired Westin','If you\'re in a rush - we recommend the Westin T. Sq. - no questions, no worries, book it, go, enjoy!\r\nIf you\'re not, we recommend it for these reasons;\r\nObviously the location of the Westin would come slap bang at the top of the list of +ve\'s for any tourist. Yeah NY is pretty spread out but this is the buzz of the city no matter who you are! Everything’s lights and glitz and some things are 24-hour, particularly the Starbucks under the hotel and the Ben & Jerrys across the road. \r\nThis hotel however still manages to be a relaxing retreat from the buzz, even if ambient noise does creep in from time to time (although, what the f*** is ambient noise in NY? NY IS noise! And what tourist isn\'t gonna hear a fire truck siren for the first time and trip over the bed on the way to the window?!)\r\nAnyway, to recap the hotel has an excellent location, that\'s a given for any Times Square hotel. But the advantage of this hotel is that it would be a very nice hotel to stay in no matter where it was placed! The staff are very helpful and \'happy-to-help\' - doormen, concierge, bell boys, room service - all very nice.\r\nThe standard rooms are spacious enough to feel some comfort of home (and a little bit more once you get in the bed!). Ahh, the bed! The \'Heavenly\' bed as it\'s called will not leaving you reading the trade descriptions act. It is, in the words of my significant other \'like a marshmallow\'. It is a very comfortable and very nice to sleep in after a day of pounding the streets, seeing the sights and racking up an enormous credit card bill!\r\nNext on the list of good-hotel points are the in-room movies, especially for us Brits. You can order loads of new releases (most aren\'t even out over here!) at the fair sum of $10.99. EG Feb 6th there was Aeon Flux, Chicken Little, Walk The Line, Flightplan, The Family Stone, etc.. Any classic console buffs? There\'s a bevy of classic Nintendo games to order too!\r\nNext up is the bathroom, it was well up to expected 5* standards and I would recommend a combo of high speed on slow speed on the multi heads. My only complaint would be the rather shallow bath, but whatever; I don\'t like baths anyway!\r\nViews are an added bonus in this hotel (see pictures). Ours was of the East River, and I\'ve seen pictures of even better views - request high floors.\r\nOther smaller things that just made it that little bit better were things like the robes, the safe, USA Today to-your-door, good TV (any CSI fans out there want year-in-advance showings? Get flicking! There\'s ABC, MTV, CNN, HBO, BBC America...), calling for (free) extra stuff (travel plugs, scales, fridge, robes, etc..) and the in-room Starbucks, iron and hair dryer. (P.S. UK ladies; your GHD\'s will NOT work properly without the correct adapters so either bring adapters or leave them and buy an excellent pair for $30 from Duane Reade round the corner.\r\nThe hotel also has a gym, spa and convenience store for your pleasure. So enjoy.\r\nSo, advantages;\r\n Location\r\n The Bed!\r\n The staff\r\n Room extra\'s (films etc)\r\n Nice bathroom\r\n Views\r\n Reasonable price\r\n Quality TV\r\nDisadvantages;\r\n Wow, jeez let me think..maybe I didn\'t like..erm - coming home??\r\nTips;\r\n Tourists - you think your two massive cases are enough for your souvenirs? They\'re not!\r\n Tourists - before you buy at Bloomingdales, go to the Visitor Centre on the 1st floor for 11\% off most things.\r\n Tourists - bring LOTS of cash! LOTS. You still won\'t have enough.\r\n Brits - the strawberries & cream frappucino is a lot better in the US!\r\n Tourists - the Trump Wollman rink in Central Park closes at 2.30 on a Monday & Tuesday.\r\n Tourists - some Broadway shows don\'t play on a Monday or Tuesday.\r\n Tourists - a taxi from JFK to Manhattan is only $45 + about $4 toll - roughly the same back! Don\'t buy a transfer from the UK. \r\nAnyway, enjoy it and don\'t blame me if you have a crap time because all this good stuff was a one-off for us :/',1


'My Truck Has a More Comfortable Bed!','Last week, 4/06/2005, I spent a night at The Palmer House Hotel in downtown Chicago. It is a nice old and elegant hotel when you are in the lobby or one of the restaurants. However, I was exhausted, arriving late at night for a job interview the next day, and really needed some decent food and sleep. My room was on the eigth floor, and I was first directed to the wrong set of elevators due to unclear instructions given at the front desk. When I did arrive at the correct elevator bank, I rode to the eighth floor, and found the signs to be utterly confusing. It took me fifteen minutes of wandering around to finally locate my room. (The next morning, I encountered another guest who complained bitterly, after a morning workout, that he could not relocate his room.) I entered the room, only to find that the air was stifling and hot. I also discovered the interior of the room could be viewed by those at the indoor swimming pool, as I was changing clothes and noticed movement. I went to eat at the Trader Vic restaurant in the complex, and was told, even though it was ten minutes before closing, that they would not serve any more meals. After finding an altrernative for dinner, I returned to a hot and musty room, despite the fact that I had left the AC running while I was out. After finally getting into bed, I discovered that the mattress sunk down to the level of the box spring, and that it was lopsided regardless of any efforts to get it to be level. Considering that this room was about $160.00 for the night (with taxes), and the reputation of Hilton Hotels, I would have expected much better than what I got. The bed of my truck is certainly more comfortable than their bed and I did not get much sleep thanks to their apparent unwillingness to replace old mattresses.',1

'The WORST Hotel in NYC!!!!!','You have to read this before you go! I stayed at this hotel in April 2004. I checked in at about 10PM. After having to stand in a queue for about 1 hour with all my suitcases and really tired, i finally got my key chucked at me, by a girl that did not even care who I was. I went up to my room, walking down the corridors, I got this really bad feeling the room was going to be bad, because the corridors look like something out of a Horror movie. I got into my room. Shock Horror, the bed had dirty sheets, someones blood on it. I did not open the closet or drawres for the week I was there, because they where AWEFULL. I lived out of my suitcase. I was worried of even having a shower there, it was filthy. My TV set was just standing there on a wooden apple box, and to top it off, my room overlooked another roof on the next building, and every morning there where people walking on that roof, and they would look into my room, as there where no curtains. This hotel should be either knocked down, or shut down and renovated. I still can\'t believe I chose this hotel. It\'s the first time I chose a hotel because it was cheap, and whitout looking in the books, and I have stayed in NYC often, I should have gone to my known hotels. If you are going to stay here, get a REFUND, and get another hotel....If not for yourself, this WILL ruin your time in NYC!!!',1

'Hotel = Fine / Price = Good / Location = Great','My girlfriend and I came up to New York to see The Gates in Central Park, (that should date this review), and the musical Hairspray. Through Priceline we got two rooms for $107 per person per night. We checked in early at 3:30 PM. She had a smoking room and I had a non-smoking room. \r\nStaff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and contained all the basic amenities, (desk with data-port, (Wi-Fi was available for $10 a day), iron and ironing board, free in-room safe and of course a small TV.)\r\nHer air-conditioner was missing a knob, my shower handle came off in my hand. If this is the sort of thing that simply ruins your vacation, (I paid $100 for this room, how DARE they!), then this may not be the place for you. Other than these quirks, (and the slow elevators), we were delighted with the hotel. \r\nWe walked out the front door and looked to the left to see Central Park then looked to the right to see billboards of Times Square (about a 1/2 mile away.) We walked everywhere because everything was so close. When we did take cabs (if our feet were sore or she was wearing high heels) we were usually no more than $5 from where we wanted to go. The hotel is also conveniently located next to the 57th street exit of the Q, N, R & W subway lines.\r\nWe asked the very friendly concierge, (guests kept coming by to thank him for his help or recommendation), about a comedy club and he gave us VIP tickets to The Laugh Factory. The tickets got us to the front of the line and first choice of seating. (I felt guilty walking past about 50 people but my girlfriend loved it.)\r\nWe both agreed that we would recommend this hotel. We give the hotel Above average for the rooms and price but bump it up to Excellent because of the location.',1

'Great Hotel - Period!!!!!!','Stayed at the Edison Hotel for the second time from December 27th to January 04th so we could enjoy the fantastic Times Square new year.\r\nBooked this hotel in February 2005 and got a very good price for 8 days. When we arrived at hotel there was no queue for check in which was great. We were served promptly and taken to our room (1918). I asked for this room as we had it the time before and it was great. No noise from any nightclubs and a good size. You may hear noise from outside such as the occassional horn or fire truck but you\'re in New York city not the Scottish highlands and this lets you know you\'re in the middle of the Big Apple.\r\nNo problems with elevators and the maid tended to our room daily and always left fresh towels and supplies. No issues what so ever with cleanliness.\r\nSo close to the center of Times Square you have to see it to really believe it. You may get nicer hotels in Times Square, but for this price this is by far the best value and the cheaper price meant more to send on shopping.\r\nThe subway in New York is cheap and a fantastic quick way to get around the city. If you need to eat when you\'re staying at the Edison I strongly recommend eating at the Deli right next to the hotel. It is called the New Diamond Cafe which has a great deli counter and serve such fresh food and drink at fantastic prices (Not yet listed on tripadvisor so I can\'t review).\r\nThere are a lot of reviews written on this website by people who I think have a chip on their shoulder and write anything they can to make this hotel sound bad, but take it from me - This is a great value, great location, great staff - Great Hotel!!!\r\nI hope that if you have booked you aren\'t put off by any reviews and I hope that when you come back you also leave a real review of the Edison Hotel New York.',1

'Stay elsewhere for the RSNA','Stay some place else. Our room was not cleaned two days in a row, despite our complaints. The room was cramped and the decor was hideous. The only advantage is that it was the first stop on our bus line, so we didn\'t have to wait in the cold for the RSNA bus.',1

'Good location and price','We stayed at the Edison June 6 and 7. You can\'t find a\r\nbetter location, and the price was great. When we arrived\r\nin the morning, our room was ready for check in. The\r\nstaff and service were fine. The beds were comfortable,\r\nand even though the building is old the room is fairly\r\nclean except for an unidentified stain on the wall (yuck)\r\nand hair in the bathroom (what is it about hair in the\r\nbathroom-every motel review mentions this........eeeeek).\r\nThe room was quiet and I didn\'t hear sounds from the\r\nstreet or other rooms.....had a non-smoking room\r\nand never smelled smoke...........',1

'Another Great Stay!','This is my second stay at this hotel and couldn\'t have been more pleased! I wrote a glowing review earlier for my wonderful stay back in January for the soap opera star Tamara Braun\'s event and I\'m back to gush some more! I have also posted the candid shots for this hotel, took some more and hopefully can post some more if they turn out. I very much enjoyed my stay! My friends and I were in NY May 20th-22nd for the Daytime Emmy Awards and to see some of the soap stars who were having events that weekend at this hotel! Basically everything went well. We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers Friday and the Marriott Marquis on Saturday and loved the Marriott much more. Firstly the Marquis\'s rooms were bigger, about our average sized hotel room across the US, but for NY standards large. The elevators were a problem, but considering they had tons of servicemen, including armed and naval, 23,000 kids and adults from the united nations organization, us soap opera fans and stars, and the average tourist and business traveler that is a whole lot of people staying in one place at one time. No wonder the elevator went down during the peak hrs. Afterwards they were back up and there was no problem. The new system is very easy to use and I was even showing others, who weren\'t sure, how the new system worked. When you first enter the elevator section you still had to choose left or right. Again all elevators went to floors 1-8. The left the elevators took you to floors 27 or 28 and above and the elevators on the right took you to floors 27 or 28 and below. This time instead of just pressing the up button and playing pot luck with the elevators, you punch in the number of the floor you want to go to and the key pad will bring up the elevator number and arrow pointing you in the direction of the elevator that will be taking you to your floor. They have signs posted everywhere and people at times assigned to help puzzled visitors with the new system. Most people tended to ignore the signs and employees who were there to help until they were confronted with the problem, but that I\'ve learned is in our nature. We don\'t seem to stop to read signs, maps, etc... unless we have to anymore. Sort of gets taken for granted. Anyways, any wait time for the elevators were negligible for us since we were confronted with the same problems with the elevators at the Sheraton on Friday and we weren\'t going to let elevators ruin our trip. All in all even when the elevators went down during their peak time the Marriott Marquis handled it well. Our room at 1056 didn\'t have much of a view, but the beds were wonderfully soft, the lights were working well, and there was space to move around in! The coffee machine and condiments weren\'t stashed in the bathroom and the water pressure was good compared to what may be found at other hotels. We went to the Rick Hearst event held at the Sky Lobby on the 16th floor. We hung out on the 8th floor where you check in and most of the restaurants at the hotel are located. The ladie\'s room on the 8th floor had a line at times and so I went and used the escalators down to the 4th floor and used the ones there. There was no lines and no wait and would highly recommend doing this for others who might not want to wait if there is a line. Also some reviewers had posted about keeping their room keys with them was really helpful and it is. I believe it was sometime after midnight and one in our party went downstairs to smoke outside the hotel and security apparently tightens after a certain time during the evening because they needed to see that she had a room key before she could get back in. We again skipped the View restaurant which opens at 4pm or so at least the sign broadcasted from the 3rd floor que where later people would be waiting in line for an elevator to take them to the restaurant. We went instead to Virgils and ate before my friend and I went over to the theatre where Denzel Washington was doing Julius Cesar. Apparently after the show he comes out to sign autographs and take pictures with his fans. Very important to have a playbill of the show for this. Anyways, check-out of the Marriott Marquis was fast via the express check out button on the telephone in the room. You leave your name and room number and all we had to do was to go to the 8th floor to turn in the room keys. The whole weekend was great and it was partly due to the Marriott Marquis! When next I\'m in NY I am more that willing to stay here again and would highly recommend it to others!:)',1

'Great Hotel - Worries about complaints totally unfounded','Shortly before travelling to NY I looked on this website for updated reviews for the Edison Hotel. I was horrified to see people complaining about the smells, cockroaches in the rooms, lack of towels, ramshackle furniture etc. As I had booked this break 10 months earlier it was going to cost me an additional £750 to change hotels. To say the least I was not looking forward to this part of our tour.\r\nI was therefore pleasantly surprised when we arrived on 17th September for 4 nights. Apart from the great location, the room was plenty big enough, the bathroom although small was adequate and while\r\nit was old it was spotlessly clean with masses of hot water. Towels (yet another complaint) were changed daily and were plentiful.\r\nAdditional pillows were provided within minutes of our request. The staff were helpful and I particularly liked it when the bell captain told the taxi driver how much we should expect to be paying so there was no fear of being ‘ripped off’.\r\nAt one end of the street you could pick up the Greyline coach for the\r\nUptown Loops and at the other end of the street you could pick up the\r\ncoach for the other Loops. \r\nThe diner attached to the hotel was excellent value and a satisfying breakfast of eggs, toast and coffee could be had for around $5.\r\nWould definitely stay here again.',1
